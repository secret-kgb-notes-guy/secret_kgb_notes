	The California Republican’s uneasiness underscores the growing anxiety among House GOP Russia hawks, who are concerned that the White House’s clandestine lobbying campaign to water down the bill could make them seem soft on Russia. It’s also a hurry-up signal to House GOP leaders, who lawmakers in both parties believe are moving far too slowly.


what are they doing here?


trying to force Trump to look like a Russian stooge?


	But GOP leaders also tucked into that “fix” a procedural change removing House Democrats’ ability to force a vote to handcuff Trump from removing sanctions on Russia. In the original bill, any House member could force a vote on blocking Trump from loosening sanctions.


so the GOP is working to help Russia?

	House leadership removed that "privileged status," essentially empowering only Republicans to bring to the floor a resolution that would block Trump from easing the sanctions.


or not? depends on how much GOP is on Russia's side. Republicans mostly seems cowardly


	Senior House Republicans also argue that the oil industry’s objections have stalled the bill.
	Exxon and Chevron, insiders say, have been complaining to GOP leaders and other members that the legislation could potentially block them from doing business on projects that have Russia connections, hurting their bottom line.


sounds like they're siding with Russia


what will this bill actually accomplish anyway?


seems pointless


if you really need this bill, should impeach Trump in the first place


might be a way to redirect anger toward Congress

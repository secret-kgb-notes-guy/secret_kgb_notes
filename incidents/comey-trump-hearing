	To know where the Russia probe is headed, pay attention to the topics Comey avoided

didn't he say not to do that?

	“I don’t think it’s for me to say” whether Trump committed obstruction, Comey demurred, “but that’s a conclusion I’m sure the special counsel will work toward, to try and understand what the intention was there and whether that’s an offense.” Comey said he took Trump’s words not as just a “hope” but as a “direction” from the highest official in the land — an order he was not about to obey.

	Comey’s devastating indictment of President Donald Trump

	His Republican interlocutors on the Senate Intelligence Committee succeeded in eliciting his repeated confirmation that, so far as he knew, Trump has never been personally under FBI investigation for possible collusion with the Russians — or anything else, for that matter.

	However, a person familiar with the discussion Comey referenced said Lynch was seeking to uphold the Justice Department's usual policy of not confirming criminal investigations.

what about the funky immunity agreements?

	"The AG told Director Comey that she had used the term ‘matter’ in response to press inquiries, in order to ensure that she neither confirmed nor denied the investigation, in accordance with longstanding Justice Department and FBI policy," the person familiar with the discussion said. "She suggested that she and the director should be consistent in their language, and at the end of the meeting, she asked if everyone was comfortable with using the term ‘matter.’ No one, including the Director, contested that view.”


"inquiry" would have been better


	Asked if the FBI was doing a "security inquiry" about Clinton's emails, Comey said: "I don't know what that means....We're conducting an investigation. That's the bureau's business...It's in our name...I'm not familiar with the term 'security inquiry.'"

	Two months later, Comey publicly closed the Clinton email probe without seeking any charges.

	 Five takeaways from Comey’s dramatic testimony

	The fired FBI director shed new light on his controversial conversations with the president about Russia matters.

	By Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney 

	Comey relayed his take in a matter-of-fact fashion but his assessment reflects a bizarre juxtaposition. Just prior to the one-on-one session with Trump, the FBI chief and other officials had just briefed the president-elect on some of the most sensitive intelligence secrets of the United States government.

	However, Comey left that briefing — and perhaps arrived at it — so dubious about Trump’s personal integrity that he felt compelled to pull out a laptop and write down all he could remember while in an FBI vehicle. The ex-FBI director said some kind of a “gut” take on Trump led him to take that precaution.


Yeah, Comey would hate Trump or have an alibi to because Trump called the justice system rigged during the campaign. Used it as a political attack against Hillary.

Although, if Comey thought Lynch was interfering with the investigation, then he would have had to admit Trump was at least partially right...

Trump also said the election would be rigged and reportedly the FBI had to deal with election day violence, so that's another alibi for Comey to conceal seething anger against Trump

	Comey hinted, most prominently, that he’d be better positioned to share his view about whether the president colluded with Russians in a classified setting with lawmakers, where he could discuss specific insights about the FBI investigation he was leading until his ouster.

	But he also suggested there were details about Sessions’ decision to recuse himself that he couldn’t talk about publicly. “Our judgment, as I recall, is that he was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons,” Comey said. “We also were aware of facts that I can't discuss in an opening setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.”


Yeah Comey did seem to drop hints

mentioning the VP was kindof weird

	The story was similar throughout the hearing. Democrats pushed Comey as far as he would go to describe acts that could be evidence in an obstruction of justice case. And Republicans raised questions about Comey’s conduct — his decision to publicly reveal memos about his interactions with Trump, and his decision not to tell Trump to back off when the president repeatedly asked him to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation.

lamenting the partisanship

didn't actually seem that partisan to me (wasn't paying attention to party tho)

thought they were almost all good questions

King's seemed the worst funny enough

Comey handed Mueller a fat case file on Trump

	But legal experts say it’s not clear Mueller has a slam-dunk obstruction of justice case against the president.


obstruction of justice not a slam dunk

	 “The nature of the person,” Comey explained in part. “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document.”

	The nature of the person. 

battle of character?

seems like both are losing fast...

	This was the essence of Comey’s testimony: that the president of the United States is at his core a dishonest and untrustworthy man. It was judgment on character, not a legal opinion, and even Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee made no real attempt to dispel it.


	“Yes,” Comey said, “it rings in my ear as kind of, ‘Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?’ ”

And from character, assigning intent

When has Trump 100% without a doubt been caught in a lie?
e.g. he can't claim ignorance

lied about meeting Putin iirc?

interesting:

	This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."   

partially right, Russian spies making up details of Russia story


	Before the presidential campaign, "I didn't know Steve (Bannon)." 

didn't he interview with him? yeah he's contradicting himself

could be one of those things were Trump just sucks with words?

	Before Comey, it was possible for national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other members of the administration (as well as GOP lawmakers) to argue that a secret back-channel with Russia was no big deal. After Comey, Americans understand that in setting up a channel to hide discussions from the intelligence community, you put American security at risk. Comey said, “You spare the Russians the cost and effort to break into our communications channels by using theirs.

	Trump's disclosures are "certainly," a risk to U.S.-U.K intelligence sharing, one of the closest bonds in espionage, says Matt Tait, a former analyst from GCHQ, Britain's equivalent of the NSA. "Lots of information is shared on the understanding that the U.S. will be able to keep it safe," Taid said. "To have a president show that he does not care about that arrangement makes countries think twice before sharing it."

	So when CrowdStrike published its technical analysis of the DNC hack and found not one, but two hackers on the network, both of whom were Russia, I was initially, let’s say, a little sceptical.

I guess he'd have a reason to be skeptical of Russian government hacking?

But why be skeptical of CrowdStrike?

	A while later, on June 14, the Washington Post reported on a hack of the DNC ostensibly by Russian intelligence. When material from this hack began appearing online, courtesy of the “Guccifer 2” online persona, I turned my attention to looking at these stolen documents. This time, my purpose was to try and understand who broke into the DNC, and why.

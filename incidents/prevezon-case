So Putin doesn't like Magnitsky act, launches all sorts of campaigns against it

	Veselnitskaya retained a former New York City prosecutor named, improbably enough, John Moscow to represent the younger Katsyv in court. Moscow’s law firm BakerHostetler in turn retained the research firm Fusion GPS, which traced assets in the U.S. to Browder—whose tip to the Justice Department sparked the Prevezon case—and aided efforts to serve the investor with a subpoena.

	Fusion GPS says its actions on Prevezon’s behalf were limited.

	In May, the Department of Justice (DOJ) settled United States v. Prevezon Holdings Ltd., a $230 million fraud and money laundering case that accused Prevezon Holdings executives of fraudulently obtaining a tax refund from the Russian treasury.

So Democrats are bouncing up and down with their theory that dropping the case was related to the Trump Jr. email, and not to Trump being involved in money laundering


maybe trying to cover for Trump?


also throws Preet Bahara in there

	The Russian government’s tactics had grown more subtle since Congress passed the original Magnitsky act in 2012, according to a congressional aide who has followed the Kremlin campaign closely.

	“As the years have gone by, they have gotten increasingly sophisticated,” the aide says. “They’ve learned from their mistakes. At first you had a Russia that would complain and threaten and then they realized the more you complain and threaten, the more you vindicate to Congress that they’ve struck a nerve.”


you'd think they'd know that from the beginning?

so are they serious about the Magnitsky act? sounds like it

sanctions affect them personally iirc

	Kremlin agents have also begun mimicking their nemesis’ tactics. “What they’re doing is they’re learning from Browder,” says the Hill aide. “Browder has been extremely media savvy.”


wtf is this


isn't manipulating the media literally how the started? they have a century of experience


	...Meanwhile, Veselnitskaya’s client continued to fight the U.S. government’s forfeiture case.

	In October, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals barred BakerHostetler and John Moscow from representing Perezon, calling it a conflict of interest because, in 2008 and 2009, Moscow had represented Browder’s hedge fund, Hermitage Capital, in its initial investigate on of the Magnitsky fraud. (Moscow did not respond to an email requesting comment.)

	On March 11, Trump fired Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney overseeing the case, after initially indicating he would keep Bharara on in the job. On March 21, a key witness in the case against Perezon, a Russian lawyer representing Magnitsky’s family named Nikolai Gorokhov, was reportedly thrown out of a fourth-floor window in Moscow.

	In April, Rohrabacher was overhead in a hotel lobby in Berlin discussing the case with Rinat Akhmetshin, a dual Russian-U.S. citizen who worked with Veselnitskaya to discredit Browder and is alleged to have ties with Russian intelligence, as CNN first reported.

	On May 12, the case was settled on the eve of trial, with Prevezon paying $6 million. On Wednesday, House Democrats asked the Justice Department to explain the settlement.

	As for the massive outlay of resources being marshaled against the Magnitsky Act and its leading proponent, Browder said he considers the Kremlin’s years-long campaign to discredit him ineffective, if annoying. “They’re not very good at it,“ he said, though, “It certainly takes up a lot of time.”


so he's saying dropping the case was all about the Magnitsky act? not sure exactly what he's getting at

	According to the Journal, Smith had been advising hacking groups claiming to have Clinton’s emails to turn them over to WikiLeaks. The next month, Smith asserted on his personal blog that “WikiLeaks has reported that they received the Clinton emails nine months ago, but have not released them. These emails were widely available.” It is not clear what led Smith to assert that WikiLeaks possessed the missing emails.

	“WikiLeaks does not keep newsworthy information from the public,” said a representative of the group in response to a question about Smith’s assertion. “Publication timing is influenced by workload, research, presentation and verification requirements as well as intensity of public interest.” The group declined to say whether it had contact with Smith, citing a policy of not disclosing its sources.


interesting, saying Peter Smith knew Wikileaks had Clinton emails somehow but didn't release them

	Susan Glasser, the editor of Politico, responded by saying she was "saddened by the personal nature of the Trump campaign's attack on an excellent reporter, Ben Schreckinger."

	ORIGINAL POST, JULY 13, 7:58 A.M.: A Massachusetts lawyer has filed a complaint with the House Office of Congressional Ethics and a letter to Special Counsel Robert Mueller alleging that Orange County congressmen Dana Rohrabacher and Ed Royce received illegal payments from pro-Russia Ukrainian groups.


introducing Rorhbacher as the obvious Russian agent?


but he was involved in lobbying against the Magnitsky act

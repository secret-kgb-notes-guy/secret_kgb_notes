	Information provided by foreign governments in confidence is different. The executive order cautions that the release of such information is “presumed” to harm national security; the rules provide that such information “must be classified.” There is a difference, however, between “must be classified” and “is classified.” After all, when an official receives information, its source and the circumstances of its disclosure may not be apparent. This category of information is not self-identifying, let alone self-classifying.

	An official who transmits that information without classifying it has violated agency rules. But the recipient now possesses information that someone else should have classified — not classified information.


wtf is this

	Comey: ‘Even if Information Is Not Marked Classified’ Doesn’t Make it Unclassified

	5. Our classification system protects us from harm.

	This myth flows naturally from the assumptions that all classified information is automatically and self-evidently sensitive and that any release of classified information would compromise national security. “On hundreds of occasions, Hillary Clinton’s reckless attempt to skirt transparency laws put sensitive information and our national security at risk,” GOP Chairman Reince Preibus said last month.

	Actually, it is our bloated classification system that puts our security at risk. 


wtf

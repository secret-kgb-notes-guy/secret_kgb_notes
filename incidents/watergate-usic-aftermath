	Some in the intelligence agencies took note of the looming scandals. CIA Director James Schlesinger, the replacement for Richard Helms who had been fired for refusing to block the FBI's Watergate investigation, ordered Agency personnel in 1973 to compile a report on CIA activities which were illegal or exceeded its charter. These "family jewels" were finally declassified in 2007, with significant redactions, as part of a new "openness" campaign. That same year, Army Intelligence carried out the destruction of domestic surveillance files, including one on Lee Harvey Oswald, a file which the Warren Commission had never seen. 



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal
	The term Watergate, by metonymy, has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included such “dirty tricks” as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious. Nixon and his close aides also ordered investigations of activist groups and political figures, using the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).


Interesting--Nixon could order investigations of political figures who were Russian spies, then make the public hate the idea of investigating those people even if the CIA and FBI already were


	After a series of court battles, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the president was obliged to release the tapes to government investigators. The tapes revealed that Nixon had attempted to cover up activities that took place after the break-in, and to use federal officials to deflect the investigation.

Interesting--so that time the tapes dammed Nixon--if there are tapes, what would they do this time? guessing Make the USIC look bad? (that time they looked bad for supposedly helping Nixon, maybe this time they could try to make them look bad for intentionally "undermining" the President?)


Wait a bunch of former CIA and FBI agents helped do the watergate scandal?


	Nixon's own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a June 23 taped conversation between the President and his Chief of Staff, H. R. Haldeman, in which Nixon asked, "Who was the asshole who ordered it?" But Nixon subsequently ordered Haldeman to have the CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for the burglary.


Interesting--possible the agents acted on their own, then Nixon covered up anyway? Agents doing break-in could be Russian spies, same with his advisors. Just create a scandal that ends with the USIC getting pounded


	President Nixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: “All right, fine, I understand it all. We won’t second-guess Mitchell and the rest.” Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: “You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That’s the way they play it and that’s the way we are going to play it.”[64][65]

	Nixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.

what if Nixon was innocent? would be funny

Like he didn't know about the break-in was like "how the fuck do I handle this" and ended up talking in ways that implicated him

	The commission was created in response to a December 1974 report in The New York Times that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. The commission issued a single report in 1975, touching upon certain CIA abuses including mail opening and surveillance of domestic dissident groups. It publicized Project MKUltra, a CIA mind control study.

	It also studied issues relating to the John F. Kennedy assassination, specifically the head snap as seen in the Zapruder film (first shown on television in 1975), and the possible presence of E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis in Dallas, Texas.

https://www.maryferrell.org/pages/Post-Watergate_Intelligence_Investigations.html
	The Watergate scandal, the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon, and the election that fall of a "reform Congress" set the stage for Congressional investigations into illegal activities and other abuses by US intelligence agencies, particularly the FBI and CIA. The abuses included domestic spying on Americans, harassment and disruption of targeted individuals and groups, assassination plots targeting foreign leaders, infiltration and manipulation of media and business, human experimentation using drugs as part of a "mind control" program, and more. 

	Leading newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post, which had covered Watergate extensively, carried articles exposing the illegalities. The New York Times carried a front-page story on 22 Dec 1974 by Seymour Hersh entitled "Huge C.I.A. Operation Reported in U.S. Against Antiwar Forces, Other Dissidents in Nixon Years." 


http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/238963/huge-c-i-a-operation-reported-in-u-s-against.pdf



http://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/huge-cia-operation-reported-in-u-s-against-antiwar-forces-other.html
	WASHINGTON, Dec. 21—The Central Intelligence Agency, directly violating its charter, conducted a massive, illegal domestic intelligence operation during the Nixon Administration against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in the United States, according to well‐placed Government sources.

	An extensive investigation by The New York Times has established that intelligence files on at least 10,000 American citizens were maintained by a special unit of the C.I.A. that was reporting directly to Richard Helms, then the Director of Central Intelligence and now the Ambassador to Iran.

size of the illegals program?

	The disclosure of alleged illegal, C.I.A. activities is the first, possible connection to rumers that have been circulating in Washington for some time. A number of mysterious burglaries and incidents have come to light since the breakin at Democratic party headquarters in the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972.

	Duping Charged

	Thoughout the public hearings and courtroom testimony on Watergate, Mr. Helms and other high‐level officials said that the C.I.A. had been “duped” into its Watergate involvement by the White House.


Tying CIA to Nixon, watergate


	These alleged activities are known to have distressed both Mr. Schlesinger, now the SecreMr.‐ Colby has reportedly told associates that he is considering the possibility of asking the Attorney General to institute legal action against some of those who had been involved in the alleged domestic activities.

	One official, who was directly involved in the initial C.I.A. inquiry last year into the alleged domestic spying, laid that Mr. Schlesinger and his associates were unable to learn what. Mr. Nixon knew, if anything.

Is Hersh trying to imply CIA covering for Nixon?


	Mr. Schlesinger was at the C.I.A. when the first word of the agency's involvement in the September, 1971, burglary of the office of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg's former psychiatrist by the White House security force known as the “plumbers” became known.

	It was Mr. Schlesinger who also discovered and turned over to the Justice Department a series of letters written to a Mr. Helms by James W. McCord Jr., one of the original Watergate defendants and a former C.I.A. security official. The letters, which told of White House involvement in the Watergate burglary, had been deposited in an agency office.

	The associate said one result of Mr. Schlesinger's inquiries into Watergate and the domestic of the C.I.A. operations was his executive edict ordering a halt to all questionable counterintelligence operations inside the United States.

	During his short stay at the C.I.A., Mr. Schlesinger also initiated a 10 per cent employe cutback. Because of his actions, the associate said, security officials at the agency decided to increase the number of his personal bodyguards. It could not be learned whether that action was taken after a threat.


Hersh seems to like Schlesinger and Colby? But spinning tall tales of CIA planning to assassinate its own director


	When confronted with the Times's Information about the C.I.A.'s domestic operations earlier this week, high‐ranking American intelligence officials confirmed its basic accuracy, but cautioned against drawing “unwarranted conclusions.”

	Espionage Feared

	Those officials, who insisted on not being quoted by name, contended that all of the C.I.A.'s domestic activities against American citizens were initiated in the belief that foreign governments and foreign espionage may have been involved.

no shit!


Hutson plan a way to blame the spying on Nixon for being politically motivated?

Charles Peirce talking about these things (http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a28978/the-huston-plan-is-back/)

	A Spooky Way’

	“The problem is that it was handled in a very spooky way.”

	“If you're an agent sitting in Paris and you're asked to find out whether Jane Fonda is being manipulated by foreign intelligence services, you've got to ask yourself who is the real target,” the official said. “Is it the foreign intelligence services or Jane Fonda?”


https://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/brainwashing/2007/bezmenov.htm
	ED: And yet these people who have been programmed and as you say [are] in place and who are favorable to an opening with the Soviet concept - these are the very people who would be marked for extermination in this country?

	YURI: Most of them, yes. Simply because the psychological shock when they will see in [the] future what the beautiful society of EQUALITY and social justice means in practice, obviously they will revolt. They will be very unhappy [and] frustrated people, and Marxist-Leninist regime does not tolerate these people. Obviously they will join the [ranks] of dissenters; dissidents. Unlike the present United States there will be no place for dissent in future Marxist-Leninist America. [Now] you can get popular like Daniel Elsburg and filthy rich like Jane Fonda for being a dissident [and] for criticizing your Pentagon. In [the] future these people will simply be [he makes a squishy noise] squashed like cockroaches for criticizing the government. Nobody is going to pay them nothing for their beautiful [and] noble ideas of EQUALITY. This they don't understand and it will be the greatest shock for them, of course. 


i fucking love this guy

	‘Gray Areas’

	“Look, you do run into gray areas,” the official said, “and, unquestionably, some of this fell into the gray area. But the director does have an obligation to guard his sources and methods. You get some foreigner snooping around and you have to keep track.”

	“Let's suppose as an academic exercise, hypothetically,” the official said, “that a foreigner believed to be an intelligence agent goes to Washington newspaper office to see a reporter. What do you [the C.I.A.] do? Because it's a Washington newspaper office and a reporter, do you scratch that from the C.1.A.'s record?

	“Sure, the C.I.A. was following the guy, but he wasn't an American.”

	A number of other intelligence experts, told of that example, described it as a violation of the 1947 statute and clear example of an activity, even if involving a foreigner, from which the C.I.A. is barred.


really? why...


	Beyond his briefings for Senator John C. Stennis, Democrat of Mississippi, and Representative Lucien N. Nedzi, Democrat of Michigan, the respective chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence subcommittees of the Armed Services Committees, Mr. Colby apparently had not informed other Ford Administration officials as of yesterday of the C.I.A. problems.

	“Counterintelligence!” one high‐level Justice Department official exclaimed upon being given some details of the C.I.A.'s alleged domestic operations. “They're not supposed to have any counterintelligence in this country.”

	“Oh, my God,” he said, “oh my God.”

	A former high‐level F.B.I. official who operated in domestic counterintelligence areas since World War I, expressed astonishment and then anger upon being told of the C.I.A.'s alleged domestic activities.

	“We had an agreement with them that they weren't to do anything unless they checked with us,” he said. “They double‐crossed me all along.”

	He said he had never been told by his C.I.A. counterintelligence colleagues of any of the alleged domestic operations that took place.


Hersh wants you to be shocked? I guess at the time there was distrust between CIA and anti-war types?

Irony being that Russia wanted the war and the anti-war ones were right...


	Two months ago, Rolling Stone magazine published a lengthy list of more than a dozen unsolved break‐ins and burglaries and suggested that they might be linked to as yet undisclosed C.I.A. or F.B.I. activities.

	Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, who was vice chairman of the Senate Watergate committee, has publicly spoken of mysterious C.I.A. links to Watergate, The White House transcripts of June 23, 1972, show President Nixon saying to H. R.‐Haldeman, his chief of staff, “Well, we protected Helms from one hell of a lot of things.”

	The remark, commented upon by many officials during recent interviews, could indicate Presidential knowledge about the C.I.A.'s alleged domestic activities.

	The possible Watergate link is but one of many questions posed by the disclosures about the C.I,A. that the Times sources say they believe can be unraveled only by extensive Congressional hearings.


Tying to Nixon again


	As head of counterintelligence, Mr. Angleton is in charge of maintaining the C.I.A.'s “sources and methods of intelligence,” which means that he and his men must ensure that foreign intelligence agents do not penetrate the C.I.A.

	The Times's sources, who included men with access to first‐hand knowledge of the C.I.A.'s alleged domestic activities, took, sharp exception to the official suggestion that such activities were the result of legitimate counterintelligence needs.

	“Look, that's how it started,”one man said. “They were looking for evidence of foreign involvement in the antiwar movement. But that's not how it ended up. This just grew and mushroomed internally.”

	“Maybe they began with a Check on Fonda,” tile source said, speaking hypothetically. “But then they began to check on her friends. They'd see her at an antiwar rally and take photographs. I think this was going on even before the Huston plan.


Hersh still hates Angelton


	The official suggested that what he called the “Nixon antiwar hysteria” may hive been a major factor in the C.I.A.'s decision to begin maintaining domestic files on American citizens.


Keeps tying to Nixon and Watergate

	He was repeatedly described by former C.I.A. officials as an unrelenting cold warrior who was convinced that the Soviet Union was playing a major role in the antiwar activities.

	One former high‐level C.I.A. official accused Mr. Angleton of a “spook mentality” who saw conspiracies everywhere. The official said that Mr. Angleton was convinced that many members of the press had ties to the Soviet Union and was suspicious of anyone who wrote anything friendly about the Soviet Union.

	Another former official characterized counterintelligence as “an independent power in the C.I.A. Even people in the agency aren't allowed to deal directly with the C.I. [counterintelligence] people.

	“Once in it,” he said, “you're in it for life.”


Shittig on Angleton again saying he's crazy


	Mr. Angleton, also reached by telephone this week at his suburban Washington home, denied that his Counterintelligence Department operated domestically.

	“We know our jurisdiction,” he said.


Why the fuck would you seperate domestic and foreign intel anyway

wouldn't it be easier to centralize that info to make it easier to catch foreign agents on U.S. soil? Like info on what's going on in Russia could help catch their spies here, and expertise on Russia could help catch their spies here

seems inefficient

not sure how "seperate foreign and domestic intel" translates to "liberty and freedom" but hersh seems to think so (seems the opposite actually now that the Russians have taken over the country)


	Mr. Angleton told of a report from a United States agent in Moscow who was relaying information to the C.I.A. on the underground and radical bombings in the United States during the height of the antiwar activity.

	A Source In Moscow

	“The intelligence was not acquired in the United States,” Mr. Angleton declared, “it came from Moscow. Our source there is still active and still productive; the opposition. still doesn't know.”

	Mr. Angleton then described how the C.I.A. had obtained information from Communist sources about the alleged demolition training of black militants by the North Koreans. He also told of recent intelligence efforts involving the K.G.B. and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.


so Hersh even reports this


	A number of former important F.B.I. domestic intelligence sources took issue with Mr. Angelton's apparent suggestion that the domestic antiwar activity was linked to the Soviet Union.

	“There was a lot of stuff [on radicals in the United States] that came in from the C.T.A. overseas,” one former official recalled, but he said a lot of it was worthless.


http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/books/review/enemies-a-history-of-the-fbi-by-tim-weiner.html
	Combating Nazi agents before and during World War II, the F.B.I. was, by its own assessment, “a laughingstock.” During the cold war, a Soviet spy said its agents were “like children lost in the woods.”

http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/vol2/html/ChurchV2_0051a.htm
	Angleton: But I still say that the FBI, in my view, are the ones who made the contribution of that statement. It was covering the problems that they had in discontinuting their mail coverage.


This where rivalry between FBI and CIA came from, fueled by Angleton? could have a lot to do with bad intelligence sharing, maybe?


http://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/huge-cia-operation-reported-in-u-s-against-antiwar-forces-other.html
	Amazement and Dismay

	Other officials closely involved with United States intelligence expressed amazement and dismay that the head of counterintelligence would make such random suggestions during a telephone conversation with a newsman.

	“You know,” said one member of Congress who is involved with the monitoring of C.I.A. activities, “that's even a better story than the domestic spying.”


Hersh trying to say: "foreign survaillence helping to catch foreign spies on U.S. soil??" RIDICULOUS!!


(reportedly that's exactly what happened with the FBI catching those 10 illegals, although not sure if that's true)

	One former C.I.A. official who participated in the 1969 and 1970 White House‐directed studies of alleged foreign involvement in the antiwar movement said that Mr. Angleton “undoubtedly believes that foreign agents were behind the student movement, but he doesn't know what he's talking about.”


director of counterintelligence "doesn't know what he's talking about"


Hersh playing-up fight between FBI and CIA


	...Victor Marchetti, a former C.I.A. official, said in a book published this year that the “counterintelligence staff operates on the assumption that the, agency— as well as other elements of the United States Government—is, penetrated by the K.G.B.

	“The chief of the C.I.A. staff [Mr. Marchetti did not identify Mr. Angleton] is said to keep list of the 50 or so key positions in the C.I.A. which are most likely to have been infiltrated by the opposition, and he reportedly keeps the persons in those positions under constant surveillance,” he wrote.

	...The former aide cited a case in the late sixties in wich Mr. Angleton turned to F.B.I. for a domestic investigation because he “believed four or five guys were agents, including two guys still in the agency [C.I.A.] and three or four who had been high‐level.”

	“They were suspected of having dealings with foreign intelligence agents,” the former official said.

	“We just went through the motions on our investigation. It was just a brushoff.”


lol wut

that guy must be an agent too!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee
	By the early years of the 1970s, a series of troubling revelations started to appear in the press concerning intelligence activities. First came the revelations of Christopher Pyle in January 1970 of the U.S. Army's spying on the civilian population[1][2] and Sam Ervin's Senate investigations produced more revelations.[3] Then on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing operations engaged in by the CIA over the years that had been dubbed the "family jewels". Covert action programs involving assassination attempts against foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments were reported for the first time. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of US citizens.


	...The Ford administration, particularly Rumsfeld, was concerned about the effort by members of the Church Committee in the Senate and the Pike Committee in the House to curtail the power of U.S. intelligence agencies. Frontline quoted U.S. diplomat and Nixon assistant Robert Ellsworth, who stated: "They were very specific about their effort to destroy American intelligence [capabilities]. It was Senator Church who said our intelligence agencies were 'rogue elephants.' They were supposedly out there assassinating people and playing dirty tricks and so forth... Well, that just wasn't true." Rumsfeld and Ellsworth prevented the committees from dismantling the CIA and other intelligence organizations

	On this day in 1975, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to create a special, 11-member bipartisan panel to probe abuses by the CIA.

	The committee received nine months to do its work. Its 150 staffers reported to Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho), the chairman, and Sen. John Tower (R-Texas), the vice chairman. It was set up along lines similar to those of the special Watergate committee that unearthed the existence of President Richard Nixon’s White House tapes, which helped seal Nixon’s doom.

	After Nixon resigned in August 1974, investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, writing in The New York Times, revealed that the CIA was destabilizing foreign governments while conducting illegal intelligence operations aimed at U.S. citizens. An outraged Senate responded by creating the Church-led committee.

	It was not always so. 


So what was the Senate ran by the Russians then too? Hersh makes it obvious what was going on right in the article

	By granting immunity to multiple witnesses, the Iran-Contra Committee impaired the Justice Department’s investigation into the scandal. For instance, over the strong objection of the Justice Department, the committee granted immunity to North and Poindexter, making prosecution so complicated that the department was ultimately forced to drop criminal charges against them

Church Committee report:

http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/contents.htm



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories
	In 1977, the FBI released 40,000 files pertaining to the assassination of Kennedy, including an April 3, 1967 memorandum from Deputy Director Cartha DeLoach to Associate Director Clyde Tolson that was written less than a month after President Johnson learned from J. Edgar Hoover about CIA plots to kill Fidel Castro.[310][311] The memorandum reads: "Marvin Watson [adviser to President Johnson] called me late last night and stated that the president had told him, in an off moment, that he was now convinced that there was a plot in connection with the [JFK] assassination. Watson stated the president felt that [the] CIA had had something to do with plot."[312][313][314][315][316] Later, Cartha DeLoach testified to the Church Committee that he "felt this to be sheer speculation".


Did Church Committee help spread JFK conspiracy theories?


http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book5/html/ChurchVol5_0004b.htm
	In the days following the assassination of President Kennedy, nothing was more important to this country than to determine the facts of his death; no one single event has shaken the country more. Yet the evidence of the Committee has developed suggests that, for different reasons, both the CIA and the FBI failed in, or avoid carrying out, certain of their responsibilities in this matter.

	The Committee emphasizes that this Report's discussion of investigative deficiencies and the failure of American intelligence agencies to inform the Warren Commission of certain information does not lead to the conclusion that there was a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.


So that will help fuel a whole bunch of conspiracy theories...

Also goes on to subtly blame the assassination on the CIA for trying to kill Castro?

	In the early twentieth century we worked to bring about a fundamental equality between all the nations of this Hemisphere one with another--to strengthen the machinery of regional cooperation within a framework of mutual respect, and under the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and the Good Neighbor Policy that goal was achieved a generation ago.

	Today we seek to move beyond the accomplishments of the past--to establish the principle that all the people of this Hemisphere are entitled to a decent way of life-- and to transform that principle into the reality of economic advance and social justice on which political equality must be based.

	This is the most demanding goal of all. For we seek not merely the welfare and equality of nations one with another--but the welfare and the equality of the people within our nations. In so doing we are fulfilling the most ancient dreams of the founders of this Hemisphere, Washington, Jefferson, Bolivar, Marti, San Martin, and all the rest.

The papers were released by Daniel Ellsberg, who had worked on the study; they were first brought to the attention of the public on the front page of The New York Times in 1971.[1][2] A 1996 article in The New York Times said that the Pentagon Papers had demonstrated, among other things, that the Johnson Administration "systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress".

	Findings

	The Committee emphasizes that it has not uncovered any evidence sufficient to justify a conclusion that there was a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.

	The Committee has, however, developed evidence which impeaches the process by which the intelligence agencies arrived at their own conclusions about the assassination, and by which they provided information to the Warren Commission. This evidence indicates that the investigation of the assassination was deficient and that facts which might have substantially affected the course or those individuals within the FBI and the CIA, as well as other agencies of Government, who were charged with investigating the assassination.

	The Committee has found that the FBI, the agency with primary responsibility in the matter, was ordered by Director Hoover and pressured by higher government officials, to conclude its investigation quickly.

	...The Committee has found that even with this narrow focus, the FBI investigation, as well as the CIA inquiry, was deficient on the specific question of the significance of Oswald's contacts with pro-Castro and anti-Castro groups for the many months before the assassination.


so they make it sound like it was either Castro or the USIC (CIA?) who killed Kennedy.

I wonder if Nixon had parnoia and though the Soviets were out to get him (which would be true since apparently advisors like Kissinger were agents and giving him advice to undo himself), so he went overboard in trying to author spying on them, which the Soviets could use to make it harder for the U.S. to monitor their activities?

Algeton: mail opening would not have been raised with Huston plan working group


Church: Hutson asked FBI, CIA, and NSA to come up with a plan to give President some options, purpose was to make it easier for Nixon to spy on people


pg 58

Church making it sound like USIC lying to Nixon to authorize mail openings?

Church saying CIA hid mail opening program from President


pg 59

Angleton basically confirms that CIA was doing its own thing with the mail openings, defy (or ignore) President


pg 61

Angleton says the mail opening program was illegal

explains it that it was "extremely important to know everything possible regarding contacts of American citizens with Communist countries"

says they also wanted to hide the mail opening program from the Soviets, since they figured the Soviets wouldn't know the program was going on


CIA set themselves up for this.. Angleton not looking very good

A pretty bad explanation for the program


Like literally all Comey, Angleton, any of these guys has to do is "oh by the why they have like 10,000 agents, convince people to be racist and fucking murdered MLK basically a founding father of the United States"

and then the public will at least understand

maybe not agree, but understand


instead set themselves up for Soviets to say "OMFG CIA SO EVIL"

would also be nice for them to do more to help the public fight back themselves

instead Comey is all like "I don't wanna talk about it"

I guess they did a lot in the 90s and recently


But gotta get more people's attention


	Angleton: I believe very much in a statement made by Director of the FBI Mr. Kelley, that it is his firm view, which he expressed in Canada at a bar association convention, that certain individual rights have to be sacrificed for the national security.


Yeah and how did that work out for the CIA? the country? dumbest thing I've ever read. Their breaking the law ultimately helped the Soviets fuck over national security.

A secure society is one where all its groups an parts can actually trust each other. All the Okhrana does is split societies and make them distrust each other, fight each other. Angleton helped them, apparently.


Mondale: Are you saing that we should take another look at our laws to see whether they fully meet the needs of national security?

Angleton: That is correct.


That makes more sense, why not say that? Say "situation was dire, Soviets infringing on Americans right to life, happiness, regret breaking law but had no choice, should update law"


Then it would be at least understandable

And now apparently Americans, public figures, politicians can't say anything critical of the KGB without getting character assasinated. Is that free speech? Is that a free society?

fucking idiot


	Mondale: Who do you think should be empowered to determine which rights should be set aside?

	Mr. Angleton: I think that, sir not being an expert in these matters, that it should be a combination of the Excecutive and the Congress


??

Was Angleton helping them deliberately?


	Mondale: I disagree with you on the question of national security. I think our Constitution provides plenty of powers to protect this country.


Does it? Constitution protects especially from Government tyranny, so if a foreign power takes over the Govnernment, it protects us from them.

But how to protect from a foreign power taking over the government in the first place?

founding fathers were very concerned about foreign interference, but scoffed at the idea that members of Congress would take "foreign gold." But they were all patriots and maybe could not have realized that there would be people in the Government who don't think like them.

pg 63

Angleton refuses to publicly say Steinbeck, others were suspected agents I guess (makes sense)


pg 64

Baker: why Nixon and Church on mail openings list? Angleton: that was an error

hmmm... was it?


pg 65

Angleton mentions that Soviets are grave threat, trashes detente, Soviet "objectives not changed" in "secret war since WWII"


pg 67

talks about Soviets recuriting students, professors

pg 68

talks about FBI CIA rivalry, "spying on FBI," Hoover upset


pg 70

Angleton says he supports the Huston plan

pg 71

"The Huston plan had no impact whatsoever on the priorities within the intelligence community."

Angelton saying the USIC was basically already doing what the Hutson plan said

Schweiker trying to tie Hutson plan to Watergate

pg 72

	Now you are quoted in your deposition, "It is inconceivable that a secret intelligence arm of the government has to comply with all the overt orders of the government." Is that an accurate quote or not?

	Mr. ANgelton. Well, if it is accurate it should not have been said.

	Church: that is right, Mr. Angleton.


Angleton doing nobody but the Russians favors


pg 73

they torture him over it, Angleton withdraws his statement, looks like shit

Angleton: I believe it was one of the few resources, routine in nature, available to counterintelligence.

Angleton kindof sounds like Comey?

pg 75

Angleton: "the Soviet bloc, coordinates their activities on their ideological basis."


what does that mean? don't think they thought of Communism as anything but a tool

	Senator Morgan: Yes; earlier you suggested that maybe Congress and the President should take some action. But the thing that bothers me, Mr. Angleton, is how can we act if we don't know the facts? And, if we do act,the intelligence agencies refuse to obey the guidelines and ordinances. In other words you were doing all of these things before the Huston plan was ever devised. You continue to do them after the President rejected the report. So, what assurances do we have that an intelligence agency would follow any mandate of the Congress or the President? And how can we prepare some mandates that would be followed? That is what this committee is searching for.

	Mr. Angleton. I have nothing to contribute to that, sir, beyond what I have said already.


Angleton makes the CIA look guilty as hell

And I think it ended up that they still were able to use Huston plan to tie the whole thing to Nixon anyway? Basically destroy trust in President and spying powers.

See Russian propaganda pointing to similar things today, although not sure if that will be their main strategy

Mostly its playing up the fight between the USIC and President, not the other way around.

pg 77

Church quotes Supreme Court ruling of saying searching mail without a Warrant is unconstitutional


pg 79-80

Angleton on balancing and Mathias on balancing Constitutional protections and fighting back against soviets

ok not really talking about "return on investment" from USIC?



Angleton says I think Pike wanted to know if America was getting "return on investment" from USIC


pg 80-81

Angleton doing a bad job of explaining the "Soviet threat"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jesus_Angleton
	Angleton's resignation was announced on Christmas Eve of 1974, just as President Ford demanded that Colby report on the allegations and as various Congressional committees announced that they would launch their own inquiries. Angleton told reporters from United Press International that he was quitting after 31 years because "my usefulness has ended" and the CIA was getting involved in "police state activities."[16] Three of Angleton's senior aides in counter-intelligence—his deputy Raymond Rocca, executive officer of the counter-intelligence division William J. Hood, and Angleton's chief of operations Newton S. Miller—were coaxed into retirement within a week of Angleton's resignation after it was made clear that they would be transferred elsewhere in the agency rather than promoted, and the counter-intelligence staff was reduced from 300 to 80 people.

Why would Angleton say that?


So Ford got a report on CIA spying, Angleton resigns, disgraced

Then the Hersh thing


But don't see that much talk about the scope and nature of the Soviet's operations...

how can democracy work if the public is kept in the dark?

now its like most if it is out there, but the Russians just try to distract attention from it

bring attention to unamsking of someone, that sort of thing, and not to extent of Russian espionage


I wonder if they have moles in CIA, FBI there to fuck everything up again? What better way to discredit the USIC then to entice them to do something illegal? they do specialize in agent provoctuears, after all...


http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/obituaries/james-angleton-counterintelligence-figure-dies.html
	With his departure, the agency cut the counterintelligence staff to 80 from 300, and turned away from some of the techniques he had pioneered. Today, some intelligence officials and members of Congress say this may have been an overreaction. They say that the recent disclosures about highly damaging Soviet espionage operations suggest that Mr. Angleton was more accurate in his suspicions than was once believed.

Hersh article Dec 22, 1974:

Angleton resigns Dec 24, 1974

Report on CIA spying to President ford Dec 25, 1974

https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul-kAQHnToC&dat=19741225&printsec=frontpage&hl=en



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Jewels_%28Central_Intelligence_Agency%29
	Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh revealed some of the contents of the "Family Jewels" in a front-page New York Times article in December 1974,[5] in which he reported that:

    		The Central Intelligence Agency, directly violating its charter, conducted a massive, illegal domestic intelligence operation during the Nixon Administration against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in the United States according to well-placed Government sources.


	According to a briefing provided by CIA Director William Colby to the Justice Department on December 31, 1974, these included 18 issues which were of legal concern:[8]

		Confinement of a KGB defector, Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko, that "might be regarded as a violation of the kidnapping laws."


Didn't Angleton direct this? fuck over CIA again. Help Make Nosenko a martyr


------


In his book Willing Accomplices, Clizbe quotes an unnamed KGB general who had served as chief of the residency in Vienna in 1961 and later at KGB headquarters as follows:  

	Active Measures were clandestine actions designed on the one hand to affect foreign governments, groups and influential individuals in ways favoring the objectives of Soviet policy and, on the other hand, to weaken the opposition to it. Such actions might or might not involve misinforming an adversary by distortion, concealment or invention, but in practice we got better results by exposing truth—selectively. We usually made the distinction clear. When someone would propose a measure, for instance, we would frequently ask him, ‘How much deza [disinformation] is involved in it?’


This seems like heart of the activities to discredit the CIA.

Reveal truth, e.g. spying on activists, don't reveal that the activists were Soviet spies trying to convince students to massacre everybody for communism or something

so the "Great debate" on how to change laws to balance keeping US intel agencies and KGB in check never happens, or is lopsided.


 	David Corn of the liberal / progressive magazine The Nation wrote that one key 'jewel' had been redacted and remained classified.

perhaps relating to JFK assassination? who knows	

this? http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/20/what-could-a-mysterious-us-spy-know-about-the-jfk-assassination-215143 complete guess

 http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/07/us/william-e-colby-76-head-of-cia-in-a-time-of-upheaval.html
	That day, the Federal judge at the trial of Daniel Ellsberg, a former Defense Department official charged with espionage after the Pentagon Papers, a secret history of the Vietnam War, were provided to The New York Times, disclosed that the office of Mr. Ellsberg's psychiatrist had been burglarized by White House operatives -- with technical assistance from the C.I.A.

	"This was a shocker," Mr. Colby recounted in his 1978 memoir, "Honorable Men" (Simon & Schuster). His immediate predecessor, James R. Schlesinger, had vowed to tear the agency apart if necessary to "find out if there were questionable or illegal activities hidden in the secret recesses of our clandestine past that we didn't know about and that might explode at any time under our feet."


http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/JW-v-CIA-Watergate-CIA-report-00146.pdf

So what are they saying? they CIA was trying to investigate leaks (pentagon papers?), ended up getting involved in Watergate instead?

pg 17

	The role of the Agency in t his matter should be considered in two aspects. The first apsect is the actual but limited involvement of the Agency by the White House staff through its requests for Agency support and assistance in presumably legitimate (albeit unusual) activities purporting to be in the national interest. It also cooperated in giving materials and assistance to Hunt up to the point that it appeared the requested supported exceeded the stated purpose. (This phase of Agency involvement is covered in Secions II and III of this report.) The second aspect is the apparent attempt by members of the White House staff to involve the Agency in supression of the FBI investigaiton of an asepct of the Watergate affair, and in what appeared to be an attempt to involve the Agency in a cover-up. The Agency's top officials refused and reuffed attempts to implicate CIA.


So there's where the CIA should dissobey an order from the "Commander and Cheif"... Church Committee seemed to have had a way of twisting things. First they accuse them of helping Nixon, then shit on them for ignoring Nixon. Either way: it's all the CIA's fault!


So sounds like perhaps the KGB tried to rope the CIA into a scandal in order to discredit them?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Plumbers
	The Plumbers' first task was the burglary of the office of Daniel Ellsberg's Los Angeles psychiatrist, Lewis J. Fielding, in an effort to uncover evidence to discredit Ellsberg, who had leaked the Pentagon Papers. The operation was reportedly unsuccessful in finding Ellsberg's file and was so reported to the White House. However, Fielding himself stated the file was in his office; he found it on the floor on the morning after the burglary and quite clearly, someone had gone through it.[5] In a September 1971 conversation, John Ehrlichman advised Nixon, “We had one little operation; it’s been aborted out in Los Angeles which, I think, is better that you don’t know about." Eventually, the case against Ellsberg was dismissed due to government misconduct.


So ostensibly begins as "trying to find leakers," ends up being painted as politically motivated--"plumbers" also working for Nixon re-election campaign (did Nixon see it that way?)


This Hunt guy one of them?

Anyway Colby makes it sound like CIA wanted the watergate break-in to happen, and wanted to help

	By Tim Weiner

	The secrets did not keep. In December 1974, The New York Times reported that the agency had spied on Americans, and Mr. Colby was a source for the article. Now the pressure for a full Congressional investigation grew irresistible. Mr. Colby cooperated, and the skeletons began tumbling out of the closet.

Colby told Hersh?

expect not hard to pin him as a Russian propagandist...

Then a few days later slashes counterintelligence staff

	Senior agency officers called him a traitor. Some hinted that he was a Soviet agent. Those hints grew darker in January 1975, after Mr. Colby dismissed James J. Angleton, for 20 years the agency's chief of counterintelligence. Obsessed with a search for a Soviet spy inside the agency, Mr. Angleton had developed ornate theories of Soviet plots to subvert the United States. Few outsiders understood them -- "possibly because Angleton's explanations were impossible to follow, or possibly because the evidence just didn't add up," Mr. Colby wrote in his memoir.

wienr shitting on CIA for torture scandal


http://www.themalaymailonline.com/opinion/reuters/article/president-trump-is-now-the-leaker-in-chief-time-weiner
	President Trump is now the leaker in chief ― Tim Weiner

	Finally, when the “great intel” story breaks, Trump’s present national security adviser, Lt. General H.R. McMaster, issues a deeply awkward non-denial denial. Twelve hours later, Trump undermines him with a tweet. The general now acknowledges that the president made an off-the-cuff decision to share secrets with his new friends.


they really dropped the ball with this McMaster thing


http://www.reuters.com/article/us-100days-leaks-commentary-idUSKBN1672B7

Weiner playing up fight between Trump and USIC and Trump and media


	Fifty-five days into his presidency, Nixon started sending great waves of B-52 bombers over Cambodia. The United States was not at war with Cambodia and the attacks were supposed to be a secret. They did not stay secret. Nixon summoned his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, into the Oval Office on April 25, 1969, and he ordered Kissinger to take responsibility for the leaks. Kissinger followed orders. With help from J. Edgar Hoover, he starting wiretapping members of his own National Security Council staff.

	The targets of the taps grew to include 13 United States government officials at the NSC, the Pentagon, and the State Department, along with four newspaper reporters. They were not foreign spies. They were American citizens.

	The White House received the wiretap transcripts – and they were useless, Nixon later said: nothing but “gossip and bullshitting.”

	The National Security Agency had its own watch list in those days, which grew to include two United States senators. One was Frank Church, an Idaho Democrat who sponsored the first bipartisan legislation against the war in Indochina. The other was Howard Baker, a Tennessee Republican, who famously asked at the 1973 Watergate hearings: “What did the president know, and when did he know it?”

	All this – and the Watergate burglary team, known as the Plumbers, because they were created to stop leaks – was in part a presidential war against the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, and of the press. Back then, the pen proved mightier than the presidential sword. Today? Well, we’ll see, won’t we?


Wiener also saying Watergate started with a hunt for leaks, apparently ended up trying to get "political opposition research?"

and now Trump doing something similar, as Weiner points out

But this is not Watergate...



http://www.npr.org/2012/02/14/146862081/the-history-of-the-fbis-secret-enemies-list
	Weiner details how Hoover became increasingly worried about communist threats against the United States. Even before he became director of the FBI, Hoover was conducting secret intelligence operations against U.S. citizens he suspected were anarchists, radical leftists or communists. After a series of anarchist bombings went off across the United States in 1919, Hoover sent five agents to infiltrate the newly formed Communist Party.

	"From that day forward, he planned a nationwide dragnet of mass arrests to round up subversives, round up communists, round up Russian aliens — as if he were quarantining carriers of typhoid," Weiner says.


Meanwhile, FBI arresting creepy Russian deep-cover spies. Wiener not making the connection?

	"It left a lifelong imprint on Hoover," says Weiner. "If he was going to attack the enemies of the United States, better that it be done in secret and not under law. Because to convict people in court, you have to [reveal] your evidence, [but] when you're doing secret intelligence operations, you just have to sabotage and subvert them and steal their secrets — you don't have to produce evidence capable of discovery by the other side. That could embarrass you or get the case thrown out — because you had gone outside the law to enforce the law."

Did wiener miss the entire court case?

calls them "Russian aliens"


Review of Weiner's book:

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/books/review/enemies-a-history-of-the-fbi-by-tim-weiner.html
	By KEVIN BAKERMARCH 30, 2012 

	The harder truth is that most presidents since Woodrow Wilson have been less intimidated by the F.B.I. than seduced by it. Under the rubric of protecting the nation, they secretly authorized the F.B.I. to open mail, infiltrate political parties, tap phones, perform “black bag” break-ins of homes and institutions, and draw up vast lists of Americans eligible for “custodial detention” during a crisis.

the horror!

	The F.B.I. conducted huge raids against pacifists, labor leaders and other dissidents during World War I, directing the arrest of tens of thousands of individuals. Yet it failed to uncover a single enemy spy, even as a nest of them blew up the enormous Black Tom munitions dump in Jersey City, riddling the Statue of Liberty with shrapnel. Combating Nazi agents before and during World War II, the F.B.I. was, by its own assessment, “a laughingstock.” During the cold war, a Soviet spy said its agents were “like children lost in the woods.”

this guy like Soviet spies more than our own?


More critical review of the book:

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/books/tim-weiners-enemies-and-fbi-counterintelligence.html
	By BRYAN BURROUGHMARCH 14, 2012

	First things first: Tim Weiner’s new book, “Enemies: A History of the F.B.I.,” is an outstanding piece of work, even-handed, exhaustively researched, smoothly written and thematically timely.

	What it is not is a history of the F.B.I. Here’s the thing: For 104 years now the Federal Bureau of Investigation has essentially worn two hats — its traditional law enforcement “arrest a bad guy” hat and its more controversial intelligence hat. The latter is the part of the F.B.I. that from World War I on investigated all manner of political radicals and Communists, compiled lists of Americans to be detained in the event of national emergency and engaged in at least half a century of illegal wiretapping, mail opening and burglaries.

	It’s this side of the shop — and exclusively this side — that interests Mr. Weiner, a former reporter for The New York Times. This shouldn’t be too surprising, given that Mr. Weiner previously wrote an admired history of the C.I.A., “Legacy of Ashes.” So, in a 500-page book on the F.B.I., this means not a word on Louis Buchalter — no Mafia at all in fact. There are only glancing references to Waco and Ruby Ridge, and barely a single sentence on the bureau’s Depression-era scramble to hunt down the likes of John Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd. This is like writing a history of the New York Yankees but ignoring Whitey Ford and the other pitchers.

$10 says Manafort is a double-agent or something

Didn't he advise Trump to pick Pence? those reports true?

Problem being if Manafort is a double-agent, that would be CIA intervening in U.S. politics in a major way

either way, we would be in very bad shape if it weren't for Pence as VP

But KGB would like to point out that FARA doesn't work for double-agents and say it's another example of U.S. "hypocrisy"

Why did Colby fire most of CIA's counterintelligence staff?


shttp://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-13/news/mn-4085_1_double-agents
	He also sharply criticized reductions in counterintelligence staffing made in the 1970s by then-CIA Director William Colby.

	At its peak in the 1960s, the CIA's counterintelligence directorate had a staff of 300, according to Angleton. He said it was cut to 80 under Colby and "it's never been built up again."


http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/10/us/washington-talk-a-counter-spymaster-s-view-assessing-intelligence-breaches.html
	 Counterespionage, sometimes called a ''hall of mirrors,'' is the most arcane branch of intelligence work, aimed ultimately, as Mr. Angleton has said, at ''penetrating the other side.'' It includes turning enemy agents around and getting them to work against their former employers, misleading opponents with false information and apprehending hostile intelligence operatives. 'Never Built Up Again'

	At its peak in the 1960's, he tells friends, the counterintelligence directorate had a staff of 300. In the reductions sought by Mr. Colby, the staff went from 280 to 80, terminating many of its operations and virtually paralyzing those remaining. ''It's never been built up again,'' he said.

	He sees now that he had become ''odd man out'' in a huge bureaucratic struggle growing out of the Watergate scandals that involved disclosures to Congressional panels of such past domestic intelligence practices as opening suspect mail.

	''If you're the odd man out, you're out,'' he said and, answering a question as to why no one high in the government had sought to protect the counterintelligence directorate, he replied: ''That isn't the way Government works. If I had wanted to intrigue I could have, but I wasn't brought up that way.''

	At the time, he said, the C.I.A. was pursuing ''four or five leads of penetration of the agency'' by Soviet operatives.

	In one case the operative had started out very young as a counterintelligence trainee in the Soviet Army. In an elaborate ruse in World War II he was parachuted behind German lines and then identified by a radio message to the Nazi Security Service. The Germans picked him up and made him into a double agent. But his true loyalty had remained with the Russians. After the war he was employed by the C.I.A., working under cover in Soviet emigre organizations based in Berlin, and was eventually taken on ''as a full-fledged intelligence officer.''

	Although fragments of suspicious information about the man had sur-faced over the years, it was not until a high-level K.G.B. official defected and provided a new clue that American counterintelligence officers became convinced that the operaive was a Soviet agent. Even as the shadow fell on him he was wily enough to deflect attention by casting suspicion on another Soviet emigre. Ultimately, through a number of clumsy bureaucratic actions, the suspect was able to avoid prosecution and, as far as Mr. Angleton knew, lived quietly in the Washington area. ''The man was a genius,'' Mr. Angleton recalled with genuine profesional respect. 

	The lesson he coldly draws from this and the current cases involving people named Howard, Walker and Pelton is that ''there will always be penetrations'' of the Government and its intelligence services by Soviet agents. ''It is a way of life,'' he said. ''It should never be thought of as an aberration. Anyone who gets flustered by it is in the wrong business.'' 


https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1979/08/inside-the-department-of-dirty-tricks/305460/
	 Colby and Vernon Walters, the deputy DCI, had both assured Schlesinger that he knew everything there was to know about the CIA's involvement in Watergate. Now Schlesinger discovered that Hunt had committed a burglary with material aid from the CIA. Schlesinger told Colby he was going to turn the CIA upside down and "fire everyone if necessary," but he intended to learn everything the CIA had done that might blindside him in the future. No more surprises!

	Colby had a plan ready to deal with this problem. He suggested that Schlesinger issue a directive to every CIA employee instructing him to come forward with anything the CIA might have done that exceeded the limits of the Agency's charter. Schlesinger thought this a good idea. Colby wrote the order, Schlesinger signed it, and copies were distributed within the CIA on May 9, 1973, the same day on which Nixon moved Schlesinger to the Department of Defense, and appointed Colby as the new director of central intelligence. Reports began to pour in. Technically, the reports were directed to the inspector general, William Broe, who signed the final report, but in fact they proceeded first to Colby's desk.


Did he use the family jewels as an excuse?

How DARE you spy on soviet spies! SOMEBODY MUST PAY!!!


	Later Colby was to be blamed widely in the intelligence community for having released the secrets deliberately. This he did not precisely do. He tried to clean house quietly, and dispose of the detritus in secret, thus allowing the CIA to consume its own smoke as it had always done in the past. The weak point in the process was the number of people let in on the secrets, not just those in the offices of the director and the inspector general who actually took charge of the paper, but the four chairmen of the House and Senate committees briefed by Colby. 


Didn't Colby report some of the "family jewels" to Hersh?

So Colby arranged a massive file of kompromat on the CIA and shows it to everybody, tells a Russian spy who publishes in NY Times

https://books.google.com/books?id=x670Aux2tJUC&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=CIA+Colby+%22fire+everyone+if+necessary%22&source=bl&ots=GqeM0leRkN&sig=AVZGScOaQr426zK32OQcrQNR9mQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpp5CF6rzUAhXKcD4KHYCoAoQQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=CIA%20Colby%20%22fire%20everyone%20if%20necessary%22&f=false

	"Fire everyone if necessary"

	DCI James Schlesinger, May 1973, to CIA operations chief William Colby after hearing news reports that Howard Hunt had used CIA equipment to break into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist; quoted in Colby, Honorable Men (1978)

	Hersh ... Regarded by many of his peers as the best investigative reporter in the world...

not hard when the KGB is tipping you off!

So Watergate sparked the "family Jewels" gathering, which (I guess) led to firing of counter-intelligence, and then to CHurch Community and "publicly humiliate the CIA month, every month" for a few years

	In the charged political atmosphere of the Watergate era, listing secrets was like stockpiling dynamite in a match factory.

	...On December 22, 1974, someone lit a match:

so Watergate gave an excuse for Colby to pile family Jewels, then (I guess) fire counterintelligence, then give it to Hersh to publish in NY Times, then to the church committee and others

	On the other hand, water-cooler gossip at the agency held that the new director himself might be a Soviet agent planted into the intelligence community's heart at its very inception. To some people in the agency, Colby's performances before Congress were at best designed to cripple the intelligence community. A worst, as hallway murmurings attested, Colby's testimony was tantamount to treason.

	...Before the Rockefeller Commission, Colby revealed so much that the commission's chairman, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, pulled him aside and said, "Bill, do you really have to present all this material to us? We realize there are secrets that you fellows need to keep and so nobody here is going to take it amiss if you feel that there are some questions that you can't answer quite as fully as you seem to feel you have to."

Colby rationalizing telling everything to Congress (telling to me actually not as interesting as exaggerating... read that he did that, not sure exactly how)

Ford fires soviet agents in Cabinet just to replace them with different Soviet agents

Actually what's up with Cheney?

Rumsfeld?


interesting the one thing Colby fights on is the CIA's budget--it's like he wanted to start the argument of "return on investment" and "is the CIA necessary" in the public

	 But the C.I.A. station chief in Jakarta at the time, B. Hugh Tovar, denied that his office gave any classified information on Indonesian Communist officials to Mr. Martens.

	The article also said that William Colby, a former Director of Central Intelligence who headed the C.I.A.'s Far East division in 1965, ''compared the embassy's campaign to identify the P.K.I. leadership to the C.I.A.'s controversial Phoenix Program in Vietnam.'' Phoenix was a C.I.A.-sponsored effort to identify Communist agents within the South Vietnamese civilian population, some of whom were later killed by South Vietnamese Army units.

	Mr. Colby said in a telephone interview that his remarks were ''misappropriated.'' He noted that he had repeatedly stated publicly that the C.I.A. had no covert involvement in the Indonesian coup or its aftermath.

	Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America

	By Philip Jenkins

	Growing anti-Soviet felling had its impact within the administration adn the intelligence community, which was already staggering in the face of post-Watergate scandals. From 1973 through 1976, the CIA was headed by WIlliam Colby, who purged anti-Soviet hard-liners. Throughout Colby's tenure as director, detente was repeatedly attacked by hawkish figures within the intelligence and defense establishment, including Donald Rumsfeld and Richard Cheney. Conservatives denounced the CIA and State Department's analysis of Soviet capabilites and intentions, which they were accused of underestimating for political ends. Though Colby rejected criticism, the hawsk won the smypahty of his successor, Geroge H.W. Bush.

	THE ANGLETON

	By SEYMOUR M. HERSHJUNE 25, 1978 

	Angleton's fundamental message that the C.I.A. counterintelligence capability has been seriously weakened by his ouster — is an ‘article of faith with his former aides. “Counterintelligence just isn't a trade you can learn in a day,” one of them said to me recently. “There's an awful lot of data you must know, an awful lot of reading you must do.” He said he and Angleton once estimated that it took a young C.I.A. recruit five years to become a sophisticated counterintelligence agent. “The K.G.B.'s got the agency on the ropes,” he added. “Whether they can bring in a Sunday punch at this point we don't know yet. The capability for C.I. [counterintelligence] and for the whole has been damaged.”

	Other present and past officials of the C.I.A. dismissed such notions

	Looking back on these events, it is difficult to quarrel with Colby's assessment that in the end it was the excesses of the Church and Pike committees--coming on top of his other troubles with the White House--that made him expendable. Yet almost from the outset of his DCI tenure two years before, he had operated under fundamental constraints limiting his authority and the impact he could reasonably expect to make as DCI.

	...Other, broader factors also limited Colby's chances of success. He had been dealt a weak hand from the outset of his tenure. By that time, mid-1973, public attitudes with respect to US intelligence had begun to shift, and some past practices, particularly those relating to covert operations, no longer enjoyed wide support. Rightly or wrongly, a certain euphoria about détente signified to many that there was now a less overriding need for continuing covert operations as a ready, effective weapon in our country's Cold War arsenal. Public support waned further when Colby himself confirmed existing suspicions about certain past CIA practices. Public dismay about Watergate had rubbed off on CIA as well, in light of the many allegations that the Agency had been involved in that scandal. At the same time, the days of coziness between a DCI and Capitol Hill mandarins were coming to an end, and new initiatives were afoot to create more thorough Congressional oversight of CIA. Throughout, Colby found he could not count on Nixon, Ford, or Kissinger for much-needed support on Capitol Hill.

	In short, Colby's effort to strengthen US intelligence through candor was seriously constrained from many sides. His revelations fueled the excesses of the Church and Pike committees, fed the public's misconceptions about the purposes of US intelligence, and weakened the country's support of intelligence--at least for some time thereafter.

	Angleton soon became the target of his own inquisition. As time passed and no high-level mole was snared, Mr. Petty became convinced that Golitsyn was a Soviet-controlled agent providing disruptive misinformation to the CIA. The mole, Mr. Petty reasoned, had to be Golitsyn’s handler: Angleton himself.

	Among Mr. Petty’s concerns was Angleton’s once-close relationship with Kim Philby, who rose to the highest levels of the British intelligence service before he was unmasked as a Soviet mole in the early 1960s.

	According to his unpublished memoir, Mr. Petty spent more than two years working secretly to investigate his supervisor. He gathered intricate details about Angleton’s movements and close associates through the years, looking for — and finding, he thought — evidence that Angleton could have collaborated with the Soviets.

	Mr. Petty admitted that it was a messy conclusion based largely on the circumstantial suggestion of guilt. “It was not a clear-cut case,” he told David Martin for “Wilderness of Mirrors,” Martin’s 1980 book about the Cold War-era CIA.

	Whatever his misgivings, Mr. Petty reported concerns about Angleton to agency superiors in 1974. He delivered several drawers full of notes and documents supporting his view, then spent at least 26 hours over the course of a week explaining his work to a senior officer in tape-recorded interviews.

	The price of that move was Mr. Petty’s job — he retired almost immediately — and his reputation. His accusation against Angleton was dismissed in a CIA study, and Mr. Petty remains one of the more controversial figures in the agency’s history.

	“To this day, there are people who don’t want to hear Ed Petty’s name,” said Mary Ellen Reese, who wrote a 1990 book about the CIA’s work in postwar West Germany. He may not have been right about Angleton, but “he acted out of his conviction regardless of the consequences to him, which he knew would be grave,” she said. “He was a man of real principle and a real patriot.”

	CIA Director William E. Colby fired Angleton in December 1974 after New York Times investigative reporter Seymour Hersh revealed that the CIA was illegally conducting counterintelligence activities against antiwar protesters and other domestic groups. 


fascinating... was Angleton a Soviet agent?

he acted like one during the Church hearings

I wonder if Petty's reccomendation gave Colby an excuse to fire Angleton?

Regarding Goltsyn and Nosenko--wouldn't be surprised if both were double-agents

Golitsyn gave minsofmration on China it seems

Nosenko misinfo on scope of Soviet activities and perhaps on JFK assassination

Maybe just a way to split CIA? put into camps, argue about it, kindof like politicizing things

even still, either of them could have been honest but fed false info by their associates... like Sun Tzu's "doomed spies" idea


seems like a lot of people in CIA are worthy of suspicion of being Russian agents, like it's almost too hard to believe... then again, how else could you get one of the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world to commit suicide?

https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol42no5/pdf/v42i5a07p.pdf
	The investigations of the Pike Com mittee, l~eaded by Democratic Represer~tative Otis Pike of New York, pafalleled those of the Church Committee, led by Idaho Senator Frank Church, also a Democrat. While the Church Committee cen tered its lutention on the more sensatioral charges of illegal activities by the CIA and other components of the IC, the Pike Committee set about ex~mining the CIA's effective ness and its costs to taxpayers. Unfortui~iate1y, Representative Pike, the committee, and its staff never develope~l a cooperative working rela tionship with the Agency or the Ford administration.


So, getting sense that Church Comittee was there to spread CIA conspiracy theories, Pike Committee there to question why the CIA needs to exist at all?

WE HAVE DETENTE GUYS C'MON!!!


	The committee consisted of seven Democrats and three Republicans. Because it was a select committee, the House leadership appointed the members. Unlike the Senate Com mittee, which was carefully balanced politically, Speaker of the House Carl Albert and Majority Leader Thomas P. ONeill, Jr., chose to give the committee a liberal Democratic majority.3 All Democratic members of the Nedzi Committee had strong negative feelings about the IC. Dem ocratic Congressman Ron Dellums, for example, stated even before the creation of the committee that I think this committee ought to come down hard and clear on the side of stopping any intelligence agency in this country from utilizing, corrupt ing, and prostituting the media, the church, and our educational system.4


	...Confron~tation would be the key to CIA an4 White House relationships with the~ Pike Committee and its staff. Eafly on, Republican Represen tative James Johnson set the tone for the relat~onship when he told Sey mour Bolten, chief of the CIA Review Staff, You, the CIA, are the enemy. ~ Colby came to consider Pike a jackass and his staff a rag tag, imthature and publicity-seeking group.~7 Even Colbys rather reserved counsel, Mitch Rogovin, saw Pik~ as a real prickly guy. . . to deal with. Rogovin believed Pike was not~really wrong in his position. He jus~ made it so goddamn diffi cult. You also had to deal with Pikes political ambitions.8

	The CTJk Review Staff, which worked~ closely with both the Church Committee and Pike Committee staffs, r~ever developed the same cooper~tive relationship with the Pike Committee staffers that it did with th~ Church Committee. The Review~Staff pictured the Pike staff ers as flower children, very young and irr~sponsible and naïve.


committee had it out for CIA

and now young people have to beg Congress not to destroy our last line of defense against the Russians... how times have changed!

	An underlying problem was the large cultural gap between officers trained in the early years of the Cold War and the young staffers of the anti-Vietnam and civil rights movements of the late 1 960s and early 1970s.

The real reason for the Vietnam war? and Angleton an others played right into it, of course


	The CL~. assessment was very different from the Pike Committees. The Pike groups ¶lnal report concluded that the foreign i~itelligence budget was three or four t~mes larger than Congress had been tol~1; that money appropriated for the I~ was hidden throughout the entire F~deral budget; that the total amount~offtmnds expended on intelli gence w~s extremely difficult to determi~ie; and that Congressional and executive scrutiny of the budget ranged I?etween cursory and nonexist ent. The report described the GAO as the aiiditing arm of Congress, but, when it came to the intelligence agen cies, especially the CIA, it was no arm at all.


	...The budget issue was only one major question raised by the Pike Commit tee. The committee also wanted to know just how effective the CIA and US intelligence had been over the past 10 years. This investigation also provoked a major confrontation between the Agency and the White House on the one hand and the Pike Committee on the other. On 9 Sep tember 1975, after submitting informal requests for information, the Pike Committee formally requested all CIA estimates, current intelligence reports and summaries, situation reports, and other pertinent documents that related to the ICs ability to predict the 1973 Mideast war; the 1974 Cyprus crisis; the 1974 coup in Portugal; the 1974 nuclear explosion by India; the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam; the 1972 declarations of martial law in the Philippines and Korea; and the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. The committee, of course, wanted all of this by the next morning. The request outraged Agency officials.

	House Select Committee hearings on the 1973 Middle East War began on 11 September. They almost immedi ately degenerated into open warfare with the executive branch. Pike, a firm believer that the classification system was strictly that of the execu tive branch and that his committee had the right to unilaterally declas sify and release information, released part of a CIA summary of the situa tion in the Middle East prepared on 6 October 1973 that had seriously misjudged Egyptian and other Arab intentions. The CIA and the White House both objected, maintaining that the release compromised sources and national security.

	...In general, however, the committee was critical of the performance of US intelligence in predicting the 1973 Mideast war; the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam; the 1974 coup in Cyprus; the 1974 coup in Portugal; the 1974 testing of a nuclear device by India; and the 1968 Soviet inva sion of Czechoslovakia.3

	...The committee instead heard from Congressman Michael Harrington and Harvard law professor Roger Fisher, both of whom called for the outlawing of all covert action; former National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, who opposed covert action in peacetime; and historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., who claimed that the CIA was indeed a rogue ele phant and who suggested that the only remedy was to impose strict executive and legislative oversight and drastically cut the intelligence budget as the ways to curb covert actions.

	William Colby, Honorable Men: My Life in the CIA (1978)

	But it was on my trip to Bangkok in early May of 1973 that I read in a newspaper the story that would radically shake up my life, and that of CIA. It was the story that reported that, during Daniel Ellsberg's trial for disclosing the Pentagon Papers, it had been revealed that the office of his psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis J. Fielding, had been broken into by Howard Hunt, using CIA equipment, in search of material that would then be turned over to CIA and from which CIA would prepare a"psychiatric profile" on Ellsberg for the White House. This was a shocker and I couldn't understand how I had never heard of it before, when I was supposed to have been in charge of assembling all the CIA material relevant to Watergate. But more disturbingly, I wondered how the news had hit Schlesinger; for I had assured him that I had told him the full story of CIA's relationship to Watergate on virtually the first day he had arrived at Langley.

	I didn't have to wait long after my return home to find Schlesinger's reaction. In a most moving vote of confidence in me, Schlesinger said he assumed that the news was as much of a surprise to me as it was to him. But then he went on to say that we would tear the place apart and "fire everyone if necessary,"

A surprise to him? it says right there he told the Washington post himself...


And Colby told Hersh of the Family Jewels

Sword and sheild pg 276:

The information withheld by Dulles and Hoover would have been most unlikely
to undermine the Warren Commission7s conclusion that Oswald had been a lone
assassin. But, when it became public in the mid-l970s, it inevitably encouraged the
belief that there had been other cover-ups which pointed to the involvement of the
intelligence community. The Watergate scandal, and the revelations of intelligence
abuses which followed, created a perfect breeding ground for the spread of conspir-
acy theories.40 Though most of the major abuses had been ordered or authorized by
successive presidents, the belief grew that, in the words of Senator Frank Church,
chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities, the CIA had been “behaving like a rogue elephant
on the rampage.”41
S E R V I C E A S E I Z E D eagerly on Church‘s ill-chosen metaphor. The KGB’s most valu-
able asset in its active measures to discredit the Agency was an embittered former
CIA operations officer in Latin America, Philip Agee (codenamed PONT),42 who
had been forced to resign in 1968 after complaints at his heavy drinking, poor finan-
cial management and attempts to proposition wives of American dip10rnats.~~
Though he remained in the West, Agee became, in effect, the CIA’S first defector. In
1973 he approached the KGB residency in Mexico City and offered what the head
of the FCD’s Counter-intelligence Directorate, Oleg Kalugin, called “reams of infor-
mation about CIA operations.”The suspicious KGB resident, however, found Agee’s
offer too good to be true, concluded that he was part of a CIA plot and turned him
away. According to Kalugin:
Agee then went to the Cubans, who welcomed him with open arms . . . The
Cubans shared Agee’s information with us. But as I sat in my office in Moscow
reading reports about the growing list of revelations coming from Agee, I
cursed our officers for turning away such a prize.4

In January 1975 Agee published an uncompromisingly hostile memoir of his
career in the CIA entitled Inside the Conzpany: CL4 Diary, which identified approxi-
mately 250 Agency officers and agents and claimed that “millions of people all over
the world had been killed or had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions
it The
self-congratulatory KGB file on
the book claims, doubtless with
some exaggeration, that it was ‘prepared by Service A, together with the Cubans.


Church helped KGB active measures

But is this guy really "first CIA defector?" doesn't sound right at all. Couldn't they have gotten all that information from Colby and the "family Jewels?" or from Angleton maybe

more on Church Committee, good summary:

http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article40860897.html
	May 28, 2015 

	The impetus for an investigation of the government’s expansive intelligence apparatus came in December 1974. The New York Times published a front-page article by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh based on a set of documents that CIA director William Colby had dubbed the “family jewels.” The documents detailed illegal operations, including warrantless wiretapping and surveillance of the civil rights and antiwar movements.

	The article created an uproar, and it quickly was determined that a congressional investigation was needed.

	Church lobbied Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., to be named committee chairman.


	...Several major reforms resulted from the panel’s work. Permanent intelligence oversight committees were set up in the House and Senate. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, who serves on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said those reforms helped end “decades of abuses” by intelligence agencies.

	“Thanks to Sen. Church’s dogged investigation, the Church Committee represented a landmark achievement in congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies,” he said.

Wyden likes Church Committee

	While the House and Senate intelligence committees continue to exercise oversight over the 17 federal intelligence agencies, Weiner said the will of Congress to maintain effective management has waned considerably. Fenn and Schwarz both said the time has come for a second Church Committee, but Weiner can’t see it happening.

Robert Frost's Last Adventure
By STEWART L. UDALL
It is now 10 years since the curtains began to open on a nuclear showdown and the two great powers of the East and West confronted each other in the Cuban missile crisis. It was in late spring or early summer of 1962 that the Soviet Union began preparing to install about 60 offensive intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Cuba, well within range of the United States. The peoples of the world then watched, waited and were brought to the very edge of great danger before the crisis was ultimately met and the feared Armageddon averted.

Through some combination of simple coincidence, the compelling forces of history and a young American President's belief in the relationship of poetry and power, I found myself in the company of one of the world's great poets, Robert Frost, and one of its most powerful men, Nikita Khrushchev, as this most crucial and tense of dramas started to unfold. Neither Frost nor I, however, was aware that we were in the presence of one who had made such a fateful decision as Khrushchev had.

It is perhaps not outlandish to suggest that Frost's mission to Moscow helped set the stage for the relaxing of tensions that was to occur between his country and the Soviet Union in the years to come and, indeed, for the forming now of positive agreements toward greater cooperation and interchange between East and West. This was the very purpose of his trip.

	His rhetoric, spurred by the support of the Soviet Union and the increasingly socialist leanings of Castro, became even more radical. In a particularly chilling speech to the First Latin American Youth Congress in late July 1960, Che saw it fit to speak of Cuba as a whole, saying that "if they [the Cuban people] should disappear from the face ofthe earth because an atomic war is unleashed in their names ... they would feel completely happy and fulfilled ..." The threat of atomic annihilation would soon be a very real one--not just for Cuba, but in essence, the world.

	Fresh Light on the Mystery of the Missiles

	1963

	The removal of the missiles stirred anger among the Fidelistas, and I was told that Fidel had gone several times to the University to appeal to the students to be quiet. Cubans made up a little poem which went like this:

		Nikita, Nikita,
		Lo que se da,
		No se quita

	i.e., Nikita, Nikita, what you gave, you can’t take back. In the eyes of the Fidelistas, the purpose of the missiles was simply to deter an American attack; they turned against us our own favorite theory of deterrence.

	...The political questions were as delicate as the military. The Russians had agreed to remove the missiles without consulting Castro. For a man—and a people—as sensitive about their national dignity, this was an affront. An island besieged by the United States, and so dependent on the U.S.S.R., could hardly afford open discussion of such questions.

	...As for the Russians, their friendliness for Cuba in no way interferes with their obvious desire for friendlier relations with the United States. These talks in Havana showed me that wherever American policy was to some degree flexible and pragmatic, rather than rigidly ideological, this paid off.

	...One way to look at the recent crisis is that we were brought to the brink of thermonuclear war because we had driven an island neighbor so far into fear and enmity that it was willing to emplace nuclear missiles against us.

	Every time we are confronted with a new revolution we take to the opium pipes of our own propaganda. Those who try to be objective or friendly are dismissed as dupes, and sometimes—as the Stalin years demonstrate—they were. But events have also shown that in the long run the dupes prove less misleading than the doped

As a successful dictator, Stalin seems to have felt that anybody who had collected so many secrets would be a No. 1 menace to security if he ever went sour. Stalin thought it safer not to wait.

The recognition of this basic axiom would dispel the fog of pretense which covers the Watergate affair now that the former Attorney General has explained why he thought it better not to tell the President, and a presidential public relations adviser has testified that ten months after the break-in the President told him, “I have racked my brain…were there any clues I should have seen…?” 


What's going on here? Nixon advisors keeping him in the dark?

	While weariness with the Vietnam war and a growing concern over escalating military costs have pushed US public opinion leftward, making fresh initiatives possible, the inertial power of the huge military establishment and the vested interests it has created in both capital and labor have left political leadership far to the right of where they were two decades ago.

	...I believe, however, that if elected McGovern will, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, grow in office and be able to lead us out of the trap which the momentum of the arms race and the Pax Americana have created.

	 Schlesinger did not remain long at the CIA; On May 9, 1973, Nixon appointed him to replace Elliot Richardson at the Department of Defense, who was replacing Richard Kleindienst at the Department of Justice, who was resigning because his old friend John Mitchell was finally facing indictment for his role in the Watergate scandal. But during Schlesinger's brief tenure as DCI, the shortest in the Agency's history, he fired more than a thousand officers throughout the Agency, more than a hundred of them old soldiers in the DDP/DDO.

	The firings came in waves: If the pace wasn't brisk enough, he would do the job himself, going down a list of officers and saying, "He's been here twenty years that's long enough, out." It was a crude method, and it got rid of some able CIA officers along with the dead wood, but Schlesinger could not be argued with.


Shlesinger purging CIA of everyone with experience


	Later Colby was to be blamed widely in the intelligence community for having released the secrets deliberately. This he did not precisely do. He tried to clean house quietly, and dispose of the detritus in secret, thus allowing the CIA to consume its own smoke as it had always done in the past. The weak point in the process was the number of people let in on the secrets, not just those in the offices of the director and the inspector general who actually took charge of the paper, but the four chairmen of the House and Senate committees briefed by Colby.

So this weird guy arguing MH/CHAOS was justified (sure I guess) is also for some reason downplaying Colby leaking family jewels to Hersh

	When Helms was DCI he did not merely keep the secrets; he made sure they were never gathered in one place. Colby's notion that the CIA might be cleansed by a process of quiet intramural confession brought all the secrets together in the 693 pages of the Family Jewels. Later Colby was to be blamed widely in the intelligence community for having released the secrets deliberately. This he did not precisely do. He tried to clean house quietly, and dispose of the detritus in secret, thus allowing the CIA to consume its own smoke as it had always done in the past. The weak point in the process was the number of people let in on the secrets, not just those in the offices of the director and the inspector general who actually took charge of the paper, but the four chairmen of the House and Senate committees briefed by Colby.


This guy covering for Colby too

	 The CIA's role in Watergate had pointed a lot of reporters in the Agency's direction. Sometime during the year and a half between May 1973, and December 1974, Seymour Hersh of the New York Times got wind of the outline—but not the name—of Operation Chaos. On December 20, 1974, he went to see William Colby, who told him that Chaos was not really illegal, it was targeted on the foreign connections of American dissidents, it had been fully authorized by the President, and besides, the whole program had been terminated. In short, Colby confirmed everything Hersh had discovered.

	But, according to several sources, Colby did not stop there. The CIA had been guilty of illegal operations, Colby confessed. For example? For example, the interception of first-class mail in New York City over a twenty-year period, a program (now terminated, like others) that had been run by counterintelligence.

	Colby Concedes C.I.A. Failed To Report Watergate Promptly

 	SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES OCT. 16, 1975 


Colby make CIA look guilty

	In the 33 years since the nearly 700 pages of “family jewel” documents were compiled at the orders of Mr. Colby’s predecessor, James R. Schlesinger, much of their content has become known through leaks, testimony or partial disclosure. Most notably, the documents were described by government officials to Seymour M. Hersh, who reported on them in articles in The New York Times beginning on Dec. 22, 1974. The first article described “a massive, illegal domestic intelligence operation” that had produced C.I.A. files on some 10,000 Americans.



http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102434.html
	Those documents portray a rising sense of panic within the administration of President Gerald R. Ford that what then-CIA Director William E. Colby called "skeletons" in the CIA's closet had begun to be revealed in news accounts. 

skeletons he leaked... the made look even worse...


http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102434.html
	Kissinger warned that if other operations were divulged, "blood will flow," saying, "For example, Robert Kennedy personally managed the operation on the assassination of [Cuban President Fidel] Castro." Kennedy was the attorney general from 1961 to 1964. 

Worried about leaks of more damming secrets, Kissinger leaks more damming secrets

Speculating Colby told Hersh extra information



http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/Colby.htm
	The proximate cause of these investigations was
a front-page story in the New York Times on December
22, 1974 by Seymour Hersh which revealed
that the CIA had been engaged for some twenty
years in the sort of domestic surveillance that had
been specifically proscribed by the CIA's charter.
The Hersh story was based on a closely-held CIA
report done the previous year by the Inspector
General, which was a compilation of all the CIA's
questionable activities prior to 1973 and which
was termed by Colby the "family jewels."
Within forty-eight hours of publication of the
Times expos, Colby effectively confirmed the veracity
of the story by announcing the resignation
of James Jesus Angleton, the CIA's chief of counterintelligence, who had been mentioned in
Hersh's report, as well as Angleton's three top deputies
on the counterintelligence staff; and Colby
hand-delivered a lengthy report of his own to Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger. Though written
in a less sensational tone than Hersh's expose, this
report clearly substantiated the fact that the counterintelligence staff as well as other elements of
the CIA had been involved in questionable and
possibly illegal activities. Colby told Kissinger that
he had cleansed his report of agents' names and secret
operations so that the President could make it
available to the press. Colby also appended to the
report information Hersh had not divulged, including
a list of alleged assassination attempts by
the CIA. Confronted with this document, President
Ford had little choice but to initiate an investigation
of the CIA.


How had the "family jewels" ever leaked to the New York Times in the first place? This was a question put to Colby in 1975 by Richard M. Helms, himself a former Director of the CIA. According to Helms's recollection
of their conversation, Colby nonchalantly
replied, "I talked to Sy Hersh." At the time,
Helms did not fully comprehend what Colby
meant by this admission. It seemed almost inconceivable
to him that the Director of the CIA,
whom he had always found to be an intelligent,
discreet, and completely responsible officer, and
who had sworn an oath to protect the nation's
secrets, could have revealed such critical information
to a newspaperman for purposes of publication.
Yet the next time Helms saw Colby, lie again
asked him about the leak. and Colby reiterated
that he had confirmed the story to flersh and the
New York Times.
That it was Colby himself who had engineered
the leak had also become clear in the meantime to
members of the CIA's counterintelligence staff
who had been forced to resign on account of it.
Newton S. Miler, then Chief of Operations for
Counterintelligence, discovered that Colby's report
to the President had been prepared within a
day of the story's appearance in the Times. Analyzing
the research that had gone into the document,
he concluded that Colby could not possibly
have written it within such a brief period.
In his autobiography, Colby gives a somewhat
more circumspect account of the incident. He
claims that tHersh telephoned him excitedly, saying
he was investigating illegal CIA activities, and
requesting an interview. Colby explains that since
Hersh had cooperated with him a few months earlier
in suppressing the story of the Glomar Explorer,*
"I felt I owed him the interview he requested
and could trust his responsibility...."


Colby leaked to Hersh? quotes Helms too

damn

	Finally, there is no basis whatever for the notion that Colby is a “mole.” If Colby were a Soviet agent, one would have expected his career to be studded with intelligence successes (which the Soviets would have provided for purposes of his promotion). But the fact is that up until Vietnam he had few if any successes as an intelligence officer. Nor had he developed any secret “sources”; instead, his career was built on his competency as an administrator and a problem-solver. Furthermore, it seems inconceivable that the Soviets, if they had managed to bring one of their agents to the point of being Director of the CIA, would then risk ruining his career by having him leak secrets to the press.

Weak reasoning to dismiss "soviet mole" theory. If he were a mole, he got to where he needed to be, didn't he?

Then Epstein goes on to give some long-winded complicated fourth theory.

This guy a Soviet agent too?

Epstein says it was to fire Angleton

	He had developed many friends and admirers among the press, and some newspaper columnists and magazines suggested in subsequent articles that Colby had inspired The Times's series as part of his effort to oust Angleton, who had entrenched himself as the C.I.A.'s guardian of internal security the way J. Edgar Hoover had entrenched himself at the F.B.I. 


Same theory that Hersh puts out...

 	His first assignment was in Italy. According to many C.I.A. officials, Angleton turned his Italian mission to excellent purpose. Working closely with Italian counterintelligence, he produced a rich lode of intelligence on the Soviets. One of me lid came home with “treasure‐trove ... a warehouse full of Soviet documents in Italy. It took years to sort out.” One of his former subordinates recalled that Angleton was widely hailed inside the C.I.A. for obtaining “a fantastic amount of code stuff.”


This say anything about Angleton?

	On the other hand, there is the matter of Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech before the Soviet party congress of 1956.

	Khrushchev's stunning denunciation of Stalin was obtained and made public by the C.I.A., and the impact on the world is history. And the credit goes largely to Angleton's section. The speech was apparently picked up by one of his counterintelligence contacts, somewhere in Eastern Europe, in exchange for a large cash payment.

hmmmm

	For Angleton, obtaining the document was not enough. He has repeatedly told friends, and some reporters, that his office began planning a major disinformation operation even while the Eisenhower Administration was still debating whether to make the speech available to the press.

	“What Jim did,” one of his friends told me, “was to doctor the speech with some pejorative stuff and leak it to the neutrals, the Indians among them. They all swallowed it. There were nasty things about the heads of 15 or 20 governments that were written by Jim [i.e., the counterintelligence staff] and attributed to Khrushchev.” The resulting furor, his friend said, was “a tremendous coup for Jim. It completely disrupted Communist efforts all over the world.”

	The fact, huwever, is that the Angleton plan was killed by higher officials before it could be put into operation. When one newspaper editor reproached Angleton recently for continuing to tell the story to reporters, Angleton replied, “Why not tell it? It muddies the water, doesn't it?”


This true? maybe not a good strategy... I mean fuck you could just tell them the truth, right?

	The revelations about intelligence programs transgressing American civil liberties ushered in a period of intense public and congressional scrutiny. The scandals forced a reevaluation of the role of intelligence organizations in a free society. What emerged in the aftermath of the debate was a new American conception of intelligence that further inclined the national security system to ignore Soviet disinformation. 

	...Colby’s reforms ... effectively downgraded the importance of disinformation and deception. First, Colby decided in favor of complete openness, revealing all the tawdry secrets of the CIA (sometimes referred to as “the Family Jewels”), ranging from failed assassination attempts of foreign leaders to spying on American citizens. ...Colby oversaw a reprioritization of intelligence functions that reduced the emphasis on covert action, counterintelligence, and human intelligence sources in favor greater reliance on technical means of collecting information and better analysis. Past public support for covert action had evaporated, and “rightly or wrongly, a certain euphoria about détente signified to many that there was now [less need for] covert operations as a ready, effective weapon in our country’s Cold War arsenal.”

	...These developments had the effect of reducing CIA attention to covert Soviet disinformation activities such as the use of forgeries and other propaganda tools to influence foreign audiences. ...In their view, the reforms amounted to unilateral intelligence “disarmament.” In the words of one intelligence traditionalist, the CIA’s counterintelligence staff basically “lobotomized itself.”


This why they don't respect the CIA having "principles"/"sticking to the rules?" they wrote the CIA's rules.

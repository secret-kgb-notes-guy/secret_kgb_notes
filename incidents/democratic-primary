	The media is beginning to tire of the Biden story.

	By Rebecca Traister

	No matter. The New York Times’ Haberman predicted that “if Mr. Biden does decide to run, the meeting will be remembered as a turning point. If he does not, it will be seen by some as a hostile act toward Mrs. Clinton as she hits choppy waters.” Either way, the story is Biden’s strength and Clinton’s fallibility.

	The Case for Covering Biden

	He’s closer to being president than Hillary is.

	By Jack Shafer 

	Biden gets a pass from reporters, but why? Vice President Dan Quayle, equally prone to the loopy comment and awkward gesture, and similarly a heartbeat away from the Oval Office, was punished for his gaffes. My colleague Timothy Noah grappled with this double standard three years ago, deciding that Biden gets the breaks Quayle didn’t because journalists understand that Biden is “not a stupid man. He’s a smart man who often says stupid things.” 

	...As Glenn Thrush noted in 2014, while Biden still longs to be elected president, he’s realistic enough to know that running against Clinton would be futile.

	Campaign Clock Ticks on a Decision by Biden
	By MAGGIE HABERMAN and PETER BAKER  OCT. 12, 2015 

	Even Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. seems to be getting a little tired of the Joe Biden Watch.

	As he attended a granddaughter’s cross-country race in Wilmington, Del., last weekend, Mr. Biden brushed past a reporter who asked about his presidential plans. “Get out of my way, will you?” he said.

	...Some supporters said they hoped a decision would come soon, in part because donors concerned about Mrs. Clinton’s performance may lose interest.

	One Democratic donor, who is considering supporting Mr. Biden and asked not to be identified in order to speak freely, said momentum for the vice president had stalled. “Back in September, there was all this excitement, and his poll numbers were going up,” the donor said. “Now, they’ve kind of leveled off.”

	...Mr. Biden has acknowledged that he may be waiting too long. “I just have to be comfortable that this will be good for the family,” he told America magazine last month. “It’s not quite there yet and it may not get there in time to make it feasible to be able to run and succeed, because there are certain windows that will close. But if that’s it, that’s it. But it’s not like I can rush it.”

	Some of those windows begin to close within weeks as filing deadlines approach.

	...Mr. Biden has been through this himself once before. In 1984, he resisted supporters encouraging him to run, but an adviser urged him to sign papers to run in the New Hampshire primary just in case. “So I signed them, almost as a lark,” Mr. Biden wrote in his memoir, “Promises to Keep.” He gave the papers to his sister and close adviser, Valerie, to file if he opted to run.

	Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, then went on vacation. By the time his plane landed, he had decided. He called his sister and told her not to file the papers.

	What Is Hillary Clinton Afraid Of?

	By Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman

	May/June 2014 

	Over the 25 years Hillary Clinton has spent in the national spotlight, she’s been smeared and stereotyped, the subject of dozens of over-hyped or downright fictional stories and books alleging, among other things, that she is a lesbian, a Black Widow killer who offed Vincent Foster then led an unprecedented coverup, a pathological liar, a real estate swindler, a Commie, a harridan. Every aspect of her personal life has been ransacked; there’s no part of her 5-foot-7-inch body that hasn’t come under microscopic scrutiny, from her ankles to her neckline to her myopic blue eyes—not to mention the ever-changing parade of hairstyles that friends say reflects creative restlessness and enemies read as a symbol of somebody who doesn’t stand for anything.

	Forget all that troubled history, and a Clinton run for president in 2016 seems like a no-brainer, an inevitable next step after the redemption of her past few years as a well-regarded, if not quite historic, secretary of state. But remember the record, and you’ll understand why Clinton, although rested, rich and seemingly ready, has yet to commit to a presidential race (people around her insist it’s not greater than a 50-50 proposition), even as she’s an overwhelming favorite.

	If Clinton says yes, she’ll have access to a bottomless pool of Democratic political talent and cash to match all those hyperbolic pronouncements about her inevitability. If she doesn’t run, the single biggest factor holding her back will be the media, according to an informal survey of three dozen friends, allies and former aides interviewed for this article

	...Clinton isn’t insane, and she’s not stupid. “When you get beat up so often, you just get very cautious,” says Mike McCurry, her husband’s former press secretary, who joined the White House team to find a first lady traumatized by the coverage of her failed Hillarycare initiative. “She [has] had a very practical view of the media. … ‘I have to be careful, I’m playing with fire.’”

I also greatly appreciate Hillary’s attention to racial profiling and criminal justice reform, and was grateful to have the chance to discuss these vital issues with her.

	...So one must be careful not to pass too harsh a judgement on Hillary Clinton, for whom polls reveal a real perception problem when it comes to being honest or trustworthy. CNN's national polling sample says 57% of Americans don't think she is either. ABC News and the Wall Street Journal put that number at 52%.

	A day after the Obama Administration arrested 10 people across the U.S. on charges of being Russian spies, the Russian Foreign Ministry has dismissed the roundup as “completely unfounded,” and alleged that the accusations have been made “in the spirit of cold war spy mania.” There is no doubt that the latter is true

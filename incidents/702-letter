http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/328351-is-reform-on-the-horizon-for-section-702-surveillance
	This dilemma has few comparisons in modern U.S. history. Optimistically, the disruptions it has created in the political landscape could stitch together an unlikely coalition to reform surveillance, joining Republican intelligence hawks with privacy and civil-liberties advocates. Alternatively, the issue's touchiness could turn the debate into a binary ultimatum between reauthorizing Section 702 in full or letting it expire.

Is that what they're going for?

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order
"collected," but searched?

	The court order expressly bars Verizon from disclosing to the public either the existence of the FBI's request for its customers' records, or the court order itself.


This is stupid, should have just announced the program publicly

Right I remember, warrantless searching of metadata

	The court order appears to explain the numerous cryptic public warnings by two US senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, about the scope of the Obama administration's surveillance activities.

	For roughly two years, the two Democrats have been stridently advising the public that the US government is relying on "secret legal interpretations" to claim surveillance powers so broad that the American public would be "stunned" to learn of the kind of domestic spying being conducted.


Maybe Wyden and Udall are targets

	In a statement issue late Thursday, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said “information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats. The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans.”

	Clapper added that there were numerous inaccuracies in reports about PRISM by The Post and the Guardian newspaper, but he did not specify any.

So what exactly does PRISM do? media will lie

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution
	Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to a law enforcement officer's physical intrusion onto private property, but with Katz v. United States (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections, such as the warrant requirement, extend to the privacy of individuals as well as physical locations

Interesting

	The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,[a] against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.


So wasn't 4th Amendment more about rights to property, not privacy?

Don't want the government to be able to enter your home and look through all your shit for no reason

How did they think of it for searches of things that aren't exactly "property?" like what would they have thought of the government reading your mail?


will probably never be able to figure out what is lawful on my own...


Can you have a reasonable expectation of privacy when you talk on phone, send email? no, since cybersecurity sucks and every nation is spying on you

So not really sure how the law should be

Nobody wants government to read their emails and everything on their phone for no reason, so that should be illegal

otherwise? not really sure...

Something is wrong with the culture at NSA? never trust somebody who uses the term "stakeholders." Is this document even real?

It seemed like Okhrana tried to influence culture of US intel agencies too, like the article about how the CIA somehow got transformed into a counter-terrorism organization and curtailed counter-intelligence against Okhrana

	That reputation was hard-won, but will only endure if we keep sight of the dynamic and increasingly market driven forces that continue to shape the SIGINT battle space.

wtf does this even mean? is the NSA insane? they sound like Tom Bossert or Valerie Jarrett

CIA intel reports from the 60's were better-written and easier to read


Is this really how the NSA talks? this is horrible

	Dear Chairman Goodlatte:
	As U.S.-based companies that provide consumer and business technology, products, and services around the world through the use of electronic data, we were pleased to see that you included in your “Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda” for the 115th Congress a reference to reforming Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (50 U.S.C. 1881a). We are writing to express our support for reforms to Section 702 that would maintain its utility to the U.S. intelligence community while increasing the program’s privacy protections and transparency. 


Isn't Goodlatte a spy? what is "Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda"


http://www.cc.org/capitolhillupdates/goodlatte_announces_innovation_amp_competitiveness_agenda_115th_congress
	The Judiciary Committee will also seek to reform section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Committee has a strong record of enacting solutions that protect both privacy and national security.  With section 702 set to expire at the end of the year, Committee leaders will again work together in a bipartisan fashion to ensure Americans’ privacy is protected as the government lawfully surveils the online activities of foreigners seeking to harm us.

That's all he said

http://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/702-letter-201705-FINAL.pdf

	As you consider reforms to Section 702, we recommend that you adopt the following changes. 


and I reccomend you stay the fuck out of writing our laws


	First, reauthorization legislation should codify recent changes made to “about” collection pursuant to NSA’s Upstream program. This reform would merely codify changes already embraced by the U.S. government with the imprimatur of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to correct deficiencies that implicate the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens.

So just making a change already in place law? ok


	Second, reauthorization legislation should require judicial oversight for government queries of the contents of 702 material for the communications of U.S. persons 

What does "judicial oversight" mean? if someone the U.S. is spying on talks to someone in the U.S., what are they going to do, ignore it? then spies can just have middle-men in the U.S. and communicate intrusion-free all day long

	Third, reauthorization legislation should narrow the definition of “foreign intelligence information” under FISA to reduce the likelihood of collecting information about non-U.S. persons who are not suspected of wrongdoing.

Vauge? what does this mean exactly?


	Fourth, increasing oversight and transparency of Section 702 collection will improve confidence in both its utility and lawfulness. Companies should be allowed to disclose the number of requests they receive by a legal authority and should be permitted to make more granular disclosures concerning the volume of national security demands that they receive. We also support further declassification of FISC orders. 

Why do they want this? a cynical interpretation would be they want to have leverage over the USIC, to be able to disclose the volume of the reuqests they get (USIC should just be transparent about this anyway)


	Finally, there should be greater transparency around how the communications of U.S. persons that are incidentally collected under Section 702 are searched and used, including how often 702 databases are queried using identifiers that are tied to U.S. persons. 

Why?


	We look forward to working with you and Ranking Member Conyers, as well as your counterparts in the Senate, as you consider improvements to Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act. 


These fuckers want to write our laws? "look forward" to it?

	The way it works is, the FISA court, through Section 702, wiretaps foreigners and then [NSA] listens to Americans. It is a backdoor search of Americans. And because they have so much data, they can tap — type Donald Trump into their vast resources of people they are tapping overseas, and they get all of his phone calls.

	And so they did this to President Obama. They — 1,227 times eavesdrops on President Obama’s phone calls. Then they mask him. But here is the problem. And General Hayden said this the other day. He said even low-level employees can unmask the caller. That is probably what happened to Flynn.

	They are not targeting Americans. They are targeting foreigners. But they are doing it purposefully to get to Americans.

	Meanwhile, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher told CNN on Thursday that he’d recently met in Berlin with an alleged former Russian spy under investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee in their Russian probe.

	Mr. Rohrabacher told CNN he met with Rinat Akhmetshin to discuss a Russian money laundering case and Russian sanctions.



http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/05/25/judge-napolitano-lack-outrage-over-obama-era-nsa-illegal-searches-astounding
	According to top secret documents made public by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court – often referred to as the FISA court – the government admitted that NSA analysts were violating surveillance rules on a regular basis.

	On "Special Report" tonight, Judge Andrew Napolitano said it's "astounding" that there's not more outrage from Americans over this report, and it's astounding that it's not being more widely reported on by the mainstream media.

	"NSA has been doing massive amounts of spying, surveilling, capturing every keystroke on every iPhone and every desktop and every phone call and all fiber optic cable in the United States that they can, without telling the FISA court about it," Judge Napolitano said.

	He said this could have affected hundreds of millions of Americans, calling it a "profound violation of the Fourth Amendment."

	Although the FISA court harshly rebuked the NSA, it's actually almost a "joke," Judge Napolitano said.

	The F.B.I. warned a Republican congressman in 2012 that Russian spies were trying to recruit him, officials said, an example of how aggressively Russian agents have tried to influence Washington politics.

	The congressman, Dana Rohrabacher of California, has been known for years as one of Moscow’s biggest defenders in Washington and as a vocal opponent of American economic sanctions against Russia. He claims to have lost a drunken arm-wrestling match with the current Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, in the 1990s. He is one of President Trump’s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill.

	Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a presidential hopeful and leading non-interventionist voice in the Republican Party, believes the United States should seek "respectful" relations with Russia and avoid antagonizing President Vladimir Putin over the ongoing political turmoil in Ukraine, where a Kremlin-backed government collapsed last week.

	"Some on our side are so stuck in the Cold War era that they want to tweak Russia all the time and I don't think that is a good idea," Paul said on Tuesday, in an interview with The Washington Post.

	..."The Ukraine has a long history of either being part of the Soviet Union or within that sphere," he said. "I don't think it behooves us to tell the Ukraine what to do. I'm not excited about saying 'hey, let's put the Ukraine in NATO' to rub Russia's nose in it."

	Republicans need to remember that Russia remains a geopolitical and military power, Paul added, and that hostile rhetoric has consequences.

	"We still need to be conscious of the fact that Russia has intercontinental ballistic missiles," he said. "Though the Cold War is largely over, I think we need to have a respectful - sometimes adversarial - but a respectful relationship with Russia."


http://www.businessinsider.com/glenn-greenwald-defends-snowden-putin-pr-stunt-2014-4
	In the appearance, described by many observers as a brazen public relations move by the Russian government, Snowden asked Putin about Russia's surveillance programs. Putin responded that Russia does not have mass surveillance along the lines of what Snowden exposed at the NSA because its intelligence agencies operate within a strict legal framework and do not have the same technical or financial resources as their American counterparts.

	On Twitter, Greenwald took a jab at those who would suggest the appearance proves Snowden, who took refuge in Moscow after being charged under the espionage act last June, is a Russian intelligence asset. 

	"Snowden should storm the Kremlin, take their surveillance docs & demand to be sent to the US: just like his brave patriotic critics would do," Greenwald wrote. 

	Greenwald did not respond to a request from Business Insider to elaborate on his comment.

Hello,

I saw that you signed this letter about FISA 702 reform:

http://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/702-letter-201705-FINAL.pdf

I'm not an expert in FISA 702, but I have noticed what looks like a Russian influence operation to shape the discourse on 702. I thought you should know about it, especially if you are planning on "working with" lawmakers on 702 reform.

Here are some notes on Russia's active measures, with plenty of sources:

This paper is also a good (if long-winded) overview of active measures:

https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf


It's not hard to find evidence of an influence operation targeting FISA 702 in Russian propaganda:

But what's more concerning is that this operation might extend to members of Congress. The U.S. Congressmen who take a pro-Putin stance also tend to attack FISA:

	Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher said Thursday that it was "terrific" that voters got more truthful information about Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, regardless of whether the hackers were Russian.

	"The hackers, whether or not they're Russian hackers, I don't know," the California congressman said.

	A California congressman who once arm-wrestled Vladimir Putin is taking an unusual stand on the crisis in Ukraine.

	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican from Orange County, was among a handful of lawmakers who voted against loan guarantees for the new government in Ukraine.

	And when a measure came before the House earlier this week "condemning the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity by military forces of the Russian Federation," Rohrabacher was the only House member to vote "present."

	..."The arbiter should be the people themselves through the ballot," added Rohrabacher, who said he supports an election monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. "There's a whole section of Ukraine where the people think of themselves more as Russians than Ukrainians."

	"The Cold War is over," he added. "Putin is not Satan."

	They are not targeting Americans. They are targeting foreigners. But they are doing it purposefully to get to Americans.


http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/rand-paul-wants-know-intelligence-community-spied
	Sen. Rand Paul is renewing a request to know if he was subject to surveillance by the intelligence community during the Obama administration.

	“This inquiry goes beyond just myself and my office,” the Kentucky Republican said in a statement Friday. “The American people need to know if their elected representatives in the Legislative branch have been swept up in Executive branch surveillance.”

	The Kentucky Republican actually sent a letter in April to President Donald Trump saying that he had an anonymous source alleging that the senator and other members of Congress were unmasked or queried during the Obama administration.

	Paul renewed that request Friday, circulating the letter publicly.

	“In light of the revelations that the names of persons associated with the Trump campaign were unmasked, I believe the allegations that myself and other elected members of the legislative branch may have also been unmasked or caught in intelligence gathering warrants investigation,” Paul wrote in the original April 10 letter to Trump.


But they way these Congressmen attack 702 is misleading. One way you can tell they're lying is that they equate "unmasking" with an "illegal search." When U.S. spies analyze an intercepted communication between a foreign spy and a U.S. citizen, the name of the U.S. citizen is "masked" by default, preventing the U.S. spy from learning the U.S. citizen's name. But U.S. spies can request for names to be "unmasked" if it's necessary to understand the communication. For example, if Putin sent this message to a U.S. citizen, and U.S. spies caught it, by default they would be allowed to see Putin's name, but not the recipient's name:

	Dear [MASKED U.S. CITIZEN NAME],

	We are sending you the rockets. It would be devastating if they explode.

	Best,
	Putin

This message might alarm a U.S. spy, so they would request for [MASKED U.S. CITIZEN NAME] to be unmasked to understand the message. If it turned out [MASKED U.S. CITIZEN NAME] was Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., the administrator of NASA, the U.S. spies would know the message is not as worrisome as they initially thought.

Despite this, some Congresspeople cite the "unmasking controversy" while apparently threatening to shelve 702:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/
	SEN. JOHN CORNYN, R-TEXAS: I want to ask Director Clapper, because, I think, unfortunately some of the discussion about unmasking is casting suspicion on the intelligence community in a way that I think is, frankly, concerning. Particularly when we're looking at reauthorizing Section 702 of the Patriot Act by the end of next year.


http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/24/gowdy_were_not_going_to_reauthorize_surveillance_programs_until_congress_gets_answers_about_unmasking.html
	Gowdy: "Not Going To Reauthorize Surveillance Programs" Until Congress Gets Answers About "Unmasking"

	..."We are not going to reauthorize these surveillance programs if the American people are not satisfied their security is going to be safeguarded,” Gowdy said.

	"So the leaks are one issue but the unmasking within the intelligence community," he continued.


They know how unmasking works--it comes up constantly in Congressional hearings. So it's hard to say for sure why they act this way. Some of them might be working for Russia: there have been members of Congress caught working for Russian intelligence before (http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/samuel-dickstein-congressman-russian-spy-111641), and Rep. Rohrabacher and Sen. Paul have been accused of working for Russia. Another possibility is that some members of Congress are worried that their contacts with foreign officials will be monitored by U.S. spies:


http://www.ajc.com/news/national/read-transcripts-rep-devin-nunes-news-conferences-about-trump-surveillance/NdZ4qQv7uBnjcH9E3HSRPJ/
	Reporter: You say that this is routine collection, incidental collection. Are you surprised by this today?

	Nunes: Yeah, I’m actually alarmed by it. We went through this about a year and a half ago as it related to members of Congress, if you may remember there was a report—I think it was in the Wall Street Journal—and there was a whole series of hearings, and then we had to have changes as to how members of Congress are informed if members of Congress are picked up in surveillance. And this looks like—it’s very similar to that, it reminds me of what happened a year and a half ago.


http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/politics/jeff-sessions-russian-officials-meetings/
	Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not disclose meetings he had last year with Russian officials when he applied for his security clearance, the Justice Department told CNN Wednesday.

	Sessions, who met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at least two times last year, didn't note those interactions on the form, which requires him to list "any contact" he or his family had with a "foreign government" or its "representatives" over the past seven years, officials said.

	...He added: "I do not recall any discussions with the Russian ambassador or any other representative of the Russian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion."
	
	Lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees say it is possible that Sessions could be questioned about those meetings and his role in the campaign -- as well as the circumstances around the Comey firing.


After all, former Senator Sessions' contacts with Russian officials (and subsequent efforts to hide them) didn't end well for him. So some Congressmen could feel like it's better to curtail foreign surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies than risk their own contacts with foreign officials being swept-up in U.S. spying. Regardless of however Attorney General Sessions' or former National Security Advisor Flynn's misconduct made it to the press, these members of Congress might fear getting caught in a similar scandal.

Whatever their reasons, it is very concerning to me that members of Congress are threatening to curtail or shelve FISA 702, especially at a time like this. Russia's "illegals program" (https://pastebin.com/NjfhJTky) is a serious threat to our country, and similar operations in the past have killed millions in China and done lasting damage to India. It would be equally concerning if private companies decided to take advantage of this situation to shape our surveillance laws for financial gain. Whatever reforms are needed in FISA 702, they must be written by people who have the public interest in mind, not their own.

And as a private citizen, I should also say that I don't appreciate large corporations like yours trying to influence our law-making process so brazenly. It's a little dumbfounding, actually, that your company would sign a letter that begins with "we recommend that you adopt the following changes" to our laws and ends with "we look forward to working with you," while simultaneously funding our representatives' campaigns. It is hoped that your organization remembers that democracy is for the people--not the highest bidder--especially for such important matters like this.

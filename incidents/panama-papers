Another marker for Russian propagandists?


Seems like the Panama papers would have damaged the KGB's operations? not completely sure atm

But I remember in the media it being played down, and instead a narrative of "well there aren't that many Americans named, so it must be a ploy by America"

So misreporting of Panama papers could be another indicator of being a Russian propagandist?

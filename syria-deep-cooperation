	Even in the best-case scenario, where Russia and Syria hold up their end of the bargain, the result could be major advances for the Assad regime. While Jabhat al-Nusra is a problem, teaming up with the Russian air force might not be the best solution.

 	Is Obama ‘offer’ for Russian cooperation in Syria too good to be true? 


I don't get why they did this

	The Obama administration has offered to help Russia improve its targeting of terrorist groups in Syria if Moscow will stop bombing civilians and opposition fighters who have signed on to a cease-fire and use its influence to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to do the same.

	The offer early this week of what one administration official called “enhanced information sharing” does not include joint military planning, targeting or coordination with U.S. airstrikes or other operations in Syria.

	But it would expand cooperation beyond the “deconfliction” talks the U.S. and Russian militaries began last year to ensure their planes do not run into each other in Syria’s increasingly crowded airspace.

	...Kerry and other U.S. officials have remained in close contact with their Russian counterparts, trying out a series of possible initiatives to revitalize the cease-fire, including the new offer of increased intelligence sharing on terrorist positions. Kerry is “fixated” on the Syria issue, “and he will stay so,” Kirby said.

	...While President Obama has steadily increased U.S. attacks against the Islamic State in Syria, he has rejected entreaties for more direct involvement in the civil war, saying that he does not see how it would improve the situation.

	But Obama has blessed efforts to persuade Russia to change its policies, including the intelligence offer.


Obama a Soviet agent?


	...“However, we consider unacceptable the approach on the part of the American establishment, which believes that they can decide in what issues they will cooperate with us,” Putin said.

	Top Military Officer: Bad Idea to Share Syria Intelligence With Russians

	Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that it would be a bad idea to share intelligence with Russia on the conflict in Syria.


http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-pentagon-idUSKCN11S1PC
	The text of one of several related documents, published on Thursday by the State Department, said both countries would "share intelligence and develop actionable targets for military action" against the al Qaeda-linked group formerly known as Nusra Front.

	It also called for "independent but synchronized efforts" in the fight against Islamic State.

	But Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggested any such military coordination at a so-called "joint integration cell" would be extremely limited. The military, he said, had no intention of forging an intelligence sharing arrangement with Russia.

	"I do not believe it would be a good idea to share intelligence with the Russians," he told the Senate Armed Services Committee, without elaborating.

	Several U.S. military and intelligence officials called the plan naive, and said Kerry risks falling into a trap that Russian President Vladimir Putin has laid to discredit the United States with moderate rebel groups and drive some of their fighters into the arms of Islamic State and other extremist groups.

	Some European members of the coalition against Islamic State forces have expressed concern about sharing intelligence with Russia, which they say has been an untrustworthy partner in Syria.

	According to the Arabic-language version of Russia’s Sputnik news agency, some “30 Israeli and Western officers” died when they were hit by three Kalibr cruise missiles fired by Russian warships in a “foreign officers’ coordination operations room” in western Aleppo, near Mount Simeon.

	In addition to the Mossad agents, the Russian report claimed, military officials from the United States, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Turkey — virtually every country hated by Iran, Syria and Russia — were killed in the strike, according to “battlefield sources.”


what was up with that?


Russia trying to convince arabic-speaking people that Russia is taking out U.S. and Mossad?


did such a strike actually happen? who was killed?


http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13950631000607
	30 Israeli, Foreign Intelligence Officers Killed in Russia's Caliber Missile Attack in Aleppo

	"The Russian warships fired three Caliber missiles at the foreign officers' coordination operations room in Dar Ezza region in the Western part of Aleppo near Sam'an mountain, killing 30 Israeli and western officers," the Arabic-language service of Russia's Sputnik news agency quoted battlefield source in Aleppo as saying on Wednesday.

	The operations room was located in the Western part of Aleppo province in the middle of sky-high Sam'an mountain and old caves. The region is deep into a chain of mountains.

	Several US, Turkish, Saudi, Qatari and British officers were also killed along with the Israeli officers. The foreign officers who were killed in the Aleppo operations room were directing the terrorists' attacks in Aleppo and Idlib.


So was this completely made up or did they actually launch missiles at a secret operations room?


https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/25/1574084/-UPDATE-US-and-Russia-have-been-at-war-in-Syria-since-Tuesday-Pravda-confirms-reports
	These reports indicate that the US and Russia have initiated direct military conflict inside Syria with casualties to the other side in what has until now publicly been a proxy war. 

	There has thus far been no official confirmation by other major state or private news services.   This reported incident follows a series of strikes that started last week with the US bombing of a Syrian military base in Eastern Syria which was followed by a Russian or Syrian airstrike on a UN aid convoy near Aleppo hours after announcements on all sides that a short-lived countrywide ceasefire was terminated.

	This is not the first time that there have been foreign military casualties inside Syria.  On several occasions, the Israelis have targeted command posts with missiles reportedly killing ranking Iranian officers and Hezbollah military commanders in southern Syria, including an Iranian General in January.  

	In February, it was reported that opposition units had used US supplied TOW missiles to kill several Russian officers in coastal Latekia Province.  www.thedailybeast.com/...

	As of August 2016, there have been 20 officially confirmed Russian Armed Forces fatalities in the Syrian war. en.wikipedia.org/...

	Meanwhile, the Military Times has acknowledged four non-fatal combat injuries to 300 Special Forces troops known to be inside Syria.  www.militarytimes.com/... It is unknown if or how many CIA or other nonuniformed US personnel have been previously killed.

	This, however, marks the first known incident where US and Russians have directly inflicted casualties on each other in Syria.  This seems unlikely to be the last.


completely batshit reporting on this


guy sounds like a Russian? trying to say the strike was justified somehow


http://www.globalresearch.ca/u-s-coalition-intelligence-operations-room-inside-syria-destroyed-by-russian-missile-attack-thirty-israeli-american-british-turkish-saudi-qatari-intelligence-officials-killed-report/5547099


same story on Russian fake news

	The Fars report conveys the impression that the Operations Room was largely integrated by Israelis. In all likelihood, the US was “calling the shots” and the facility was coordinated by Washington’s regional allies, in close liaison with (and on behalf) of the US military and intelligence apparatus.

	With the exception of the Fars report and Sputnik Arabic, this Russian attack directed against a US-led coalition intelligence facility has not made the headlines. In fact there has been a total news blackout. The accuracy of the Fars report is yet to be fully ascertained.

	What is significant is that the Operations Room situated in rebel held territory in the Aleppo region is manned by the main state sponsors of ISIS Daesh and Al Qaeda inside Syria, namely the US, UK (largely involved in the air raids), plus four countries of the region: Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Qatar. The respective roles of the four regional countries relating to recruitment, training, logistics and the financing of terrorism have been amply documented.


strange


U.S. news doesn't report on it at all?


http://www.pravdareport.com/video/23-09-2016/135692-syria-0/
	According to the Fars, personnel of the intelligence services was involved in the US Air Forces' attack on the Syrian forces, which was carried out just after armistice agreements had been reached in Geneva.


they make it sounds like a tit-for-tat


https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d24_1474768144


more of Pravda reporting on it?


So why would Russian propaganda want to report this? I guess covering it up would look worse?


I guess if Obama gave the Russians the location after all his generals warned him not to Putin is free to bomb them all he wants and blackmail Obama for giving him the intel in the first place?

Report by timesofisreal is interesting 


http://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-mossad-other-foreign-agents-killed-in-aleppo-strike/
	More than 300,000 people have been killed since Syria’s conflict erupted in March 2011 with protests calling for the ouster of President Bashar Assad.

	There was meant to be a halt to the fighting around Aleppo, beginning on September 13. Despite several alleged breaches, the truce had led to calm in the city, and last week, the Syrian army announced that it would observe a freeze on fighting until midnight on September 19.

	Once the Arab country’s largest city, Aleppo has been a horrific battleground since 2012, divided between government- and rebel-held areas. Over the summer, the 250,000 people living in the opposition districts endured more than 40 days under complete blockade after government forces captured all roads out of the area.

	Rebel reinforcements broke a hole in the blockade in August. But in heavy bombardment over the following weeks, more than 700 civilians were killed. Syrian troops backed by Russian airstrikes retook the roads and clamped the siege back on. Then the truce came into effect, sealing both sides’ positions in place.


So Judah Ari Gross points out that the ceasefire helped cement Russian gains in Syria


kindof like the ceasefire in China with Marshall and Chaing Kai-sheck?


call for a ceasfire when you want to consolidate gains and re-group


If this was important for them it might have been worth burning political capital for Obama to implement it


but anyway maybe this is part of a kind of arguement? like Mossad and U.S. saying Russia cheated with the ceasfire timing, firing back on Pravda accusing them of breaking ceasfire, which apparently they think somehow justifies lobbying a missile into an operations room and killing 30 intelligence officers

RT some 4chan meme account?

mostly tweets about Star Wars, gibberish


maybe he's with Mossad or something and they're very good

nobody would suspect this ultra pro-Isreal guy posting nonsensical memes of being an Isreali intleligence officer


although Russian agents also post nonsensicle memes constantly

We have to take seriously the possibility that Rep. Nunes and Rep. King are Russian spies.

Despite leading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's influence operations, Nunes has consistently cast doubt on Russia's involvement with the election and with Trump's team:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html
	Some key Republican lawmakers have continued to question the quality of evidence supporting Russian involvement.

	“I’ll be the first one to come out and point at Russia if there’s clear evidence, but there is no clear evidence — even now,” said Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of the Trump transition team. “There’s a lot of innuendo, lots of circumstantial evidence, that’s it.”

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sought-to-enlist-intelligence-officials-key-lawmakers-to-counter-russia-stories/2017/02/24/c8487552-fa99-11e6-be05-1a3817ac21a5_story.html
	Nunes, who served as a member of Trump’s transition team, has resisted calls for his House committee to investigate alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russia. He said in an interview that after months of investigations, U.S. authorities have turned up no evidence of such contacts.

	“They’ve looked, and it’s all a dead trail that leads me to believe no contact, not even pizza-delivery-guy contact,” Nunes said, appearing to rule out even unwitting contact between Trump officials and Russian agents. Investigators, Nunes said, “don’t even have a lead.”

http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/white-house-gop-intel-committee-heads-push-back-russia-reports-n726301
	 The White House and congressional Republicans pushed back Monday on reports that aides with President Donald Trump's campaign had contact with Russians — continuing a story line that continues to dog the administration.

	The administration's defensive strategy — including outreach to Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr and House Intelligence chairman Devin Nunes to counter the media narrative — comes as even some Republicans are questioning the independence of a congressional-led investigation.

	...Nunes told reporters Monday he has not been given evidence that Trump's presidential campaign staffers had contact with Russians. His confidence comes despite his acknowledgement that his committee is in the early stages of its investigation and have yet to begin collecting information.

http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/devin-nunes-house-russia-investigation/
	Nunes also brushed off calls by Democrats and at least one Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa, for an independent investigation into Russia's influence and hit back against allegations that he coordinated a response to previous reports with the White House.

	"They can say whatever they want, but at the end of the day, I hold the gavel, they're in the minority and we're going to do what we want to do. We have the votes and we've been elected to do that. If that ever changes, then obviously that would be different," Nunes told CNN. "At this point, I'm not going to give up jurisdiction of this committee that for a long time that has been trusted with the nation's top secrets. We are not going to give up that jurisdiction to anyone else as long as I'm here."


Nunes says there's "nothing there" and he "doesn't even have a lead," despite extensive evidence pointing to Russia's involvement (https://medium.com/@j_doe/http-democrats-intelligence-house-gov-news-documentsingle-aspx-documentid-211-80172a682f10).

Nunes lies to cover up Russia's involvement. Both Nunes and Flynn were members of Trump's transition team, and the transition team was informed that Flynn was a foreign agent. But Nunes covered for Flynn, and brushed-off calls to investigate him:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/27/rep-devin-nuness-strange-defense-of-trump-he-was-too-busy-to-tell-flynn-to-talk-sanctions/
	Rep. Devin Nunes’s strange defense of Trump: He was too busy to tell Flynn to talk sanctions

	...QUESTION: But did President-elect Trump at the time of the transition team tell Flynn to talk to the Russian ambassador?

	NUNES: Look, I find that — I would find that hard to believe because they were so busy, and I think these conversations were all very short.

http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/323411-trump-transition-team-was-told-flynn-would-likely-need-to-register-as
	President Trump’s transition team was reportedly told that former national security adviser Michael Flynn would likely have to register as a foreign agent before stepping into the job despite White House claims that Trump was unaware of his lobbying work.

http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/intelligence/319323-intel-chair-on-flynn-reports-nothing-there
	House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) says he expects embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn to keep his job amid controversy over his talks with the Russian ambassador.

	“It just seems like there’s a lot of nothing there,” Nunes told Bloomberg News on Monday.


Nunes also served on the Trump transition team with Manafort. Despite Manafort's extensive and potentially criminal ties to Russia (http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/manaforts-ukrainian-blood-money-caused-qualms-hack-suggests-235473), Nunes suggested that calling him in for investigation would be a "McCarthyism Witch Hunt:"

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/30/torture-lobbyist-paul-manafort-still-advising-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks.html
	According to two sources with knowledge of the Trump presidential transition process, Manafort—whose formal association with the president-elect ended in August—is heavily involved with the staffing of the nascent administration.

http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/02/27/devin-nunes-donald-trump-russia-contact-manafort-stone-page-mccarthyism-witch-hunt
	Congressman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said on "Your World" that his committee would not partake in a "McCarthyism witch hunt" just because one press report made allegations against American citizens.

	Nunes said he will not immediately subpoena former convention manager Paul Manafort Jr., former advisor Roger Stone nor former campaign consultant Carter Page before his committee after their names appeared in the Times' report.


Rep. King likewise tries to cover up Russia's involvement in our politics:

	Rep. King: Leak That Led to Flynn's Resignation Is a 'Criminal Action'

	Rep. Peter King (R-NY) said on "The First 100 Days" tonight that authorities should investigate who leaked a wiretapped conversation between former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/rep-peter-king-gen-flynn-one-first-people-who-was-really-isis
	Hours before National Security Director Michael Flynn resigned for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his telephone conversations with the Russian ambassador, Rep. Peter King described Flynn as “almost prophetic” in predicting the threat posed by ISIS.

	King (R-N.Y.) told CNN on Monday afternoon that he’s had “a very good relationship” with Flynn, who also served in the Obama administration.

http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1702/17/cnr.04.html
	KING: No, to me, so far this is not a story. Let me tell you why. I'm on the Intelligence Committee. And we are going to fully investigate Russia and should be. If there's any evidence at all, it should be followed to the fullest extent. But take "The New York Times" story, which is basically a rerun of the story that ran months ago. It talks about three possible people who had some connection with Donald Trump, who are in touched with Russians. Then buried in the middle of the story it says after all this investigation, there is no evidence of any collusion and there's no evidence of any criminal activity. That's where it's at. 


King, along with AG Sessions, has called for a "purge" of leftover Obama appointees, despite serious concerns surrounding how many of Trump's appointees were picked:

http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/gop-lawmaker-demands-purge-obama-holdovers-n732101
	"If I were Donald Trump, I would take a look at all of my political appointees that — and anybody that was an appointment that came from the Obama administration. I would end that tomorrow morning, or tonight for that matter," King said.

	"I will use the word purge," he added. "I've used it over the last few days. I think that needs to happen. I think it's a descriptive word that fits well within the English language, and I know there are people that will attach extra meaning to that. I don't know a better word to use." 

http://business.time.com/2013/07/24/u-s-poised-to-charge-billionaire-steve-cohens-sac-capital-hedge-fund-reports/
	The United States government is preparing to charge SAC Capital, the multi-billion dollar hedge fund operated by the reclusive Wall Street trading legend Steven A. Cohen, with criminal charges, according to multiple reports.

	Kevin O’Connor, the general counsel for Steven A. Cohen’s investment firm, is overseeing staff picks for the Justice Department as a member of President-Elect Donald Trump’s transition team, according to a chart obtained by Bloomberg.

	The Justice Department announced Friday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has asked all 46 remaining Obama administration U.S. attorneys to resign.


And both Rep. King and Rep. Nunes have long lead the charge of sewing distrust in our military and intelligence agencies:

http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/253348-spy-watcher-lawmakers-worry-about-politicized-analysis
	Lawmakers worry US intel suppressed for political reasons

	...“The politicization of intelligence products would be a major issue, and these allegations need to be thoroughly investigated,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said in a statement.

http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2011/08/peter-king-wants-probes-into-bin-laden-raid-film-038269
	In a letter Tuesday to the inspectors general of the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, King pointed to reports that director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal are getting special access to the Navy SEALs and others involved for a Sony Pictures film.

	"The administration's first duty in declassifying material is to provide full reporting to Congress and the American people in an effort to build public trust through transparency of government," King wrote. "In contrast, this alleged collaboration belies a desire of transparency in favor of a cinematographic view of history."

	...CIA spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency's cooperation with Hollywood is routine.

	Nunes can’t explain why or how multiple subsections of the Defense Department would lie about Lajes. But the House Intelligence chairman’s own relationship with the Azores and the Portuguese government is extensive — and a private source of consternation for some congressional and defense staffers.

	Nunes & King: CIA may be manipulating intelligence for political purposes, creating "house of cards"


Both Nunes and King are on the House Intelligence Committee. If they are spies, this could be an incredible national security risk. If they gain access to raw intelligence including sources and methods, and pass this to the Kremlin, it could lead to the deaths of our agents overseas.

Nunes and King have been demanding access to raw intelligence, all the while suggesting the finished or unclassified evidence the USIC has provided is untrustworthy:

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/12/14/rep_peter_king_almost_like_cia_is_carrying_out_a_disinformation_campaign_against_donald_trump.html
	"Somebody had the time to leak it to the Washington Post, but they don't have the time to come to Congress. It is the House Committee on Intelligence that absolutely has the jurisdiction over the CIA and the intelligence community," he said. "It is their job to come. They don't have any choice."

http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/12/15/intelligence-agencies-refused-house-intelligence-committee-request-for-report-on-russian-hackers/
	The House Intelligence Committee had to cancel a briefing set on Capitol Hill for Thursday after their request for more information from the CIA and other intelligence agencies was denied.

	Chairman of the committee U.S. Rep Devin Nunes released a statement Wednesday night expressing his disdain for the handling of the request by the intelligence agencies.

	“It is unacceptable that the Intelligence Community directors would not fulfill the House Intelligence Committee’s request to be briefed tomorrow on the cyber-attacks that occurred during the presidential campaign,” Nunes said. “The legislative branch is constitutionally vested with oversight responsibility of executive branch agencies, which are obligated to comply with our requests.”

	He also added, “The Committee is deeply concerned that intransigence in sharing intelligence with Congress can enable the manipulation of intelligence for political purposes.”


Their language isn't very different from Kremlin propagandist William Binney:

https://www.reddit.com/r/russianpropaganda/comments/5tqnbz/john_schindlers_conduct_is_consistent_with_being/
	“If the CIA is alleging a different story, they need to produce the evidence like they did on the Chinese hack,” Binney said. “There is no reason to withhold this kind of information, especially if they can prove it and so far as I can see they won’t even brief the House Intelligence Committee on the evidence they are using to make this statement. That tells me that what they are saying is a pack of crap.”

	“That are just concocting these things to support the existing administration and to also support the move toward a new Cold War.”


But it looks increasingly likely that the House Intelligence Committee, including Rep. King and Rep. Nunes, will gain access to all intelligence information regarding Russia's operations:

http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/congress-timeline-trump-russia-investigation/
	Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and ranking Democrat Adam Schiff requested that acting Director of National Intelligence Michael Dempsey make intelligence staff and contractors available for assistance and interviews by the committee and deliver "any and all counterintelligence information" collected, including transcripts of conversations and raw and finished intelligence, according to a copy of the letter sent last Friday that was provided to CNN by a committee source.

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-russia-investigation-cia-intelligence-235774
	 House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said members of his panel had also made visits to CIA headquarters and that there will be “more trips out there.” He said he was close to reaching an agreement with the intelligence community on whether evidence would be turned over to Congress or continue to be housed within the agencies.

https://www.buzzfeed.com/alimwatkins/the-people-investigating-russias-role-in-the-election-worry
	Despite jurisdictional issues, Senate investigators are getting unprecedented access to raw intelligence to conduct the investigation. Just last week, the intelligence community approved a small cohort of intelligence committee staff and 15 bipartisan members of the panel to have access to Gang of Eight intelligence — material normally reserved only for the president, vice president, and eight select members of congress. “[This has] never happened before,” the third official said.

	The House Intelligence Committee has also received assurances from the intelligence community that its investigators will be provided access to Gang of Eight documents, a House aide said. That commitment, the aide said, came from the director of national intelligence’s office.


Reportedly, the Director of national intelligence has promised unprecedented access to raw intelligence to the House Intelligence Committee. If this report is true, our country could be in serious danger. Russia's espionage, propaganda, and hacking attack on our country is unprecedented in magnitude, and we should expect our intelligence regarding this to be similarly unprecedented in it's level of sensitivity and damage if it were captured by the Russians. This could be a massive loss in a new Cold War.

It's impossible to prove somebody is a Russian spy from media reports alone. However, given the incredible risks involved, the utmost caution is required. One should consider why the USIC has, up until now, been hesitant to give the House Intelligence Committee access to sensitive information.

If Russia can install Trump in a presidential election, they can install spies in a Congressional election. This wouldn't be the first time Russia has gained spies in our Congress.

	Rep. Peter King defends Muslim 'radicalization' hearing

	Peter King, the New York lawmaker at the center of the controversial hearing, says not to conduct the probe would be a 'craven surrender to political correctness.' Democrats compare the proceeding to Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist hearings. Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca stresses the need to build trust between the police and Muslim Americans.

https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jan/27/features11.g22
	Like pathologists trying to explain a freak viral outbreak, American historians have been poring over the McCarthyist phenomenon for the past half-century, striving to explain how a small group of legislators, the House Un-American Activities Committee, managed to paralyse US democracy and scar a generation.

	But the great, ironic secret at the committee's roots has emerged only now, in Moscow. According to newly unearthed KGB files, the committee's founding father - the man who paved the way for Senator Joe McCarthy's witch-hunts - was a Soviet spy.

	His name was Samuel Dickstein, a Democratic congressman from Manhattan who created the committee's prototype in 1934 as a means for hunting down home-grown Nazis.

	...But to the NKVD (the KGB's precursor) Dickstein was an important, if troublesome, agent whose mercenary instincts earned him the codename 'Crook'. For just over two years, at the onset of the second world war, his handlers believed he was worth the money. It was the first and - as far as anyone knows - the last time the Soviet spymasters managed to 'buy' a member of Congress.

The KGB defector Bezmenov gives an insightful, if colorful, description of the mindset behind these "subversive" activities:

	Sun Tzu said, "All warfare is based primarily on deception of your enemy. To fight on the battlefield to achieve your goals is the most primitive and barbaric to achieve your goals. The highest art of war is not to fight at all, but to subvert anything of value in your enemy's country." Which includes religion, moral principles, traditions, and natural established relationships between people, families, groups, classes, races.  Turn the blacks against the whites; turn the teachers against students; turn Ralph Nader against the government; labor unions against business; homosexuals against heterosexuals; and keep on fighting, my dear friends, until you demoralize and destabilize yourself and then you flop like a rotten apple and the enemy will take you over. You will invite the enemy.


The principle behind this kind of attack is that immoral societies collapse. So, Russian agents of influence have attacked our country by attacking society.

It's important to understand that there's more to active measures than agents of influence writing op-eds in the newspaper. Anything that influences public opinion can be part of active measures, from staged protests to terrorist attacks:

	Racial tensions were high in the US during the 1960s. Race riots surrounding the Civil Rights Movement were causing mass unrest across the country. The KGB thought that they could exploit this and make it worse by inducing animosity or outright violence between racial groups in the US.

	The plan, called Operation PANDORA, began with the KGB spreading fake pamphlets that appeared to be from the Jewish Defense League, a right-wing Jewish political organization now classified by the FBI as a terrorist organization. The pamphlets, which were actually penned by the KGB, claimed that black Americans were attacking Jews and looting Jewish-owned shops in New York. The fake pamphlets implored their readers to fight against “black mongrels.” The KGB then sent these anti-black flyers to black militant groups, hoping it would stir anti-Semitism in the black organizations, if not outright violence.

	Concurrently, the KGB was also sending fake letters to black militant groups which claimed that the Jewish Defense League had been targeting and attacking blacks in America. The letters implored the black militants to attack the Jewish Defense League in retaliation. The Jewish Defense League’s leader, Meir Kahane, was assassinated a year later, though the act was carried out by an Arabic man who was seemingly unconnected to any black militant groups.

	As part of their operation to stir racial unrest, the KGB also planned to blow up a black college. After the college was bombed with a planted explosive device, the KGB planned to make anonymous calls to a series of black organizations and claim that the Jewish Defense league had been behind the bombing.


Ethnic conflict is one way for societies to collapse, and the Russians have long sought to increase racial tensions in the U.S. Staging terrorist attacks and making it look like they are motivated by racism is one way for them to try to increase distrust between ethnic groups.

The best way to explain active measures is to think of it as directing a play, where the end goal is for the "audience" (the public or government leadership of the target country) to

This is why its so important for the American public to take an active role in defending our country from this--we can decide the culture and values of our country, but if we don't act, we're leaving it up to spies and agents of influence to shape our society.

Still, there are no signs that these influence operations will stop so long as the Okhrana exists, and they are growing more bold. We can and should stop partisanship, racism (see https://medium.com/@bb06/ideological-subversion-and-racism-f3d09421cf78), pseudoscience (like propaganda on vaccines and climate change, touched upon here: https://pastebin.com/e4qCs1AT), wars (see: https://pastebin.com/e4qCs1AT and https://pastebin.com/hLQ7TZRG) and corruption, (https://pastebin.com/5gW5CpME), but ultimately the single best thing we could do to improve humanity's odds is to end the Okhrana.

The White House Director of Strategic Communications is a senior member of the President's staff, reporting directly to the President and working in conjunction with the White House Communications Director.

President Donald Trump formed the position in late 2016, naming one of his closest advisors and earliest political aides, Hope Hicks, as the nation's first holder of this office.[1]

The exact responsibilities have yet to be clearly defined, but are assumed to include coordinating media appearances, advising the President on messaging, and serving as a confidant on key matters involving personnel and in executing the President's agenda, an extension of the role Hicks served in the Trump campaign and transition

With enough well-placed agents of influence, Russian intelligence can change a country's policies or public opinion to benefit themselves or hurt the target country without its people even knowing. You can see this in India, where the KGB paid Indian politicians to "criticize US foreign policy and undertake actions supportive of Soviet foreign policy" (https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf), or in China, where supposed Russian "scientists" convinced Mao's government to adopt agricultural policies based on pseudoscience, contributing to the Great Chinese Famine (https://pastebin.com/e4qCs1AT). Just by convincing policymakers and the public of certain ideas, Russian intelligence can gain significant benefits from a country (e.g. "ally with the Soviets and let us use your territory for military operations" in India) or do serious damage to a country (e.g. "plant all your seeds very close together and plough very deeply" in China).

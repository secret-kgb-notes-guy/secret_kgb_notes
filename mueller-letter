Hello,

I've been looking into Russian influence operations (some of them are pretty extensive--and scary--see: https://pastebin.com/NvVkFqEW), and I found some things that might be relevant to the special counsel investigation.

A list of most of my findings is here:


https://pastebin.com/PZsFzNG5


And some findings not included in that are here:


https://pastebin.com/GGscui1n - Assad's relation to ISIS and Trump's ceasefire deal

https://pastebin.com/GKXW77g3 - Terrorism in Afghanistan and Russia's support of the Taliban

https://pastebin.com/n0KDeKBn - corruption under Joe Arpaio  and  Trump's character


I've been sending emails to people in Washington and the media over the course of this project, and these are basically those emails copied and pasted into pastebin. Some of them are hurried and others are more thought out, although overall I've been getting positive feedback.

Regarding the findings: First, its worth pointing out that Russian penetration of the U.S. Government, media, and other positions of influence over U.S. policy and public opinion has historically been extensive:


http://wunc.org/post/former-spymaster-three-decades-cia
	 A central theme in his books is that spies have often been successful in the U.S. because Americans are consistently loath to believe their countrymen would betray them. "You certainly see in the first hundred years or so [of American history], they are totally blind to this," Sulick told host Frank Stasio on The State of Things. "But even on into the 20th century, in the 1930s and 1940s when the Soviets basically riddle the FDR administration and the Manhattan Project with - now they're estimating - about 500 spies."


http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-us-has-more-to-lose-than-russia-in-spy-expulsions
    “There are more Russian operatives, declared and undeclared, in the United States now than at any other time in the past fifteen years,” the official told me. “They’re here in large numbers, actively trying to penetrate a whole host of sectors—government, industry, and academia.”

    THE MITROKHIN ARCHIVE
 
    ...The facts, however, are far more sensational even than the story dismissed as impossible by the SVR. The KGB defector had brought with him to Britain details not of a few hundred but of thousands of Soviet agents and intelligence officers in all parts of the globe, some of them "illegals" living under deep cover abroad, disguised as foreign citizens.


https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2009/07/17/declassified-documents-reveal-kgb-spies-in-the-us
	Declassified Documents Reveal KGB Spies in the U.S.

	...newly released documents from U.S. and Soviet archives show that hundreds of people, from the famous to the obscure, crossed paths with Soviet intelligence during the pre-World War II years. They include the country's most famous physicist, Robert Oppenheimer, novelist Ernest Hemingway, and civil servants like Hiss. There were journalists, too, like Walter Lippmann, I. F. Stone, and Bernard Redmont, a former correspondent for U.S. News who has been denying spying allegations for more than a half century.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bentley
	Elizabeth Terrill Bentley (January 1, 1908 – December 3, 1963) was an American spy for the Soviet Union from 1938 until 1945. In 1945 she defected from the Communist Party and Soviet intelligence and later (1952) became an informer for the U.S. She exposed two networks of spies, ultimately naming over 80 Americans who had engaged in espionage for the Soviets.

	Redmont continued to hew the position that Bentley was a fantasist, linking her to "pathological liars, cranks, seekers of attention or publicity, or paid purveyors of tales and innuendoes." He insisted that he had been a victim of hysteria: "Tens of thousands of us, who in some way had the wrong acquaintances, or had been denounced, anonymously or not, but informers, crackpots or self-styled patriots, were caught in the gears."

	The evidence is, however, that Bernard Redmont, distinguished American journalist and dean of a college of journalism, was the fabricator, not Elizabeth Bentley. An October 1994 KGB report lists his real nae and cover name ("Mon") and identifies him as one of Bentley's sources. ...In December 1945 the KGB station in London informed Moscow Center that Kim Philby had turned over a copy of Bentley's 1945 FBI statement given to British SIS. The KGB report listed forty-one KGB sources Bentley had identified to the FBI, adding their KGB cover names (which Bentley had not known). The last one on the list was, "41. Bernard Redmont (Mon)." A 1948 report, again giving his real name and "Mon" cover name, listed him among the Soviet intelligence contacts exposed by Bentley's defection.

	...William Dodd, Jr.

	I.F. Stone assisted in recruiting William Dodd Jr., as a KGB agent in 1936


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_E._Dodd,_Jr.
	William Edward Dodd, Jr. (Aug. 8, 1905 - Oct. 18, 1952) was an American political activist who ran unsuccessfully for Congress during the 1930s.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._F._Stone
	I. F. Stone (Isidor Feinstein Stone, 24 December 1907 – 18 June 1989) was a politically radical American investigative journalist and writer.

	He is best remembered for the newsletter, I. F. Stone's Weekly (1953–71), which was ranked in 16th place among "The Top 100 Works of Journalism in the United States in the 20th Century" by New York University's journalism department in 1999, and in second place among print journalism publications.


And it is likely that this trend has continued to this day (reports say as much, see some of the excerpts here: https://pastebin.com/NvVkFqEW and here: https://pastebin.com/r5PHGSnz).

This has implications for the special counsel investigation. First, collusion between Trump's team and the Russian government need not involve quid-pro-quo deals over email and meetings between Trump's team and Russian officials, as some recent reports allege. Russian "illegals" are said to infiltrate U.S. policymaking circles by befriending people "who might one day hold positions of power and influence" (https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/operation-ghost-stories-inside-the-russian-spy-case), and someone like Trump, who has long expressed a desire to run for office (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-1996-presidential-race-20170112-story.html), would be a choice target for spies seeking influence with a future U.S. President. A careful investigation would seek to determine if any such spies had gained entry into Trump's campaign and the Trump administration.

Second, there is a body of evidence that Russian propagandists operate in both "alternative media" and the mainstream media, some of which is documented here:


	https://pastebin.com/ar4GWrRT - "Someone's got it out for mcmaster"

	https://pastebin.com/z49g6KKe - "journalism, influence operations, and plausible deniability"

	https://pastebin.com/r5PHGSnz - "influence operations and Russian spies"


And throughout the links in here: https://pastebin.com/PZsFzNG5

Clearly, this is important for assessing Russia's efforts to influence public opinion during the election. Most of the Russian propaganda in "alternative media" (see: http://www.propornot.com/p/home.html) has been blatantly pro-Trump, and suspected propagandists in the mainstream media help Trump in more subtle ways, like overplaying minor Trump scandals or making up scandals entirely. The idea is that the public grows numb to fake and overblown Trump scandals over time; when the real Trump scandal comes, it fails to register--a sort of "boy who cried wolf" effect.

For investigations into collusion with Russia, it's worth looking at how certain people in the media influence Trump specifically:


https://www.vox.com/2017/8/7/16083122/breakfast-club-fox-and-friends
	We analyzed 17 months of Fox & Friends transcripts, which captures nearly a year before Trump was elected president and about six months after. (More on the methodology at the bottom of this piece.)

	What we found is that Fox & Friends has a symbiotic relationship with Trump that is far weirder and more interesting than state media. Instead of talking for Trump, they are talking to him.


Some pundits have shifted from political commentary toward giving Trump advice. Sometimes they give good advice:


http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/08/21/trump-should-not-hold-rally-charlottesville-tensions-kennedy
	Kennedy: Trump Should Not Hold Rally With Charlottesville Tensions Still Simmering


And sometimes they give not so good advice:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCRGNoyjx4E&t=5m20s


Regardless, Trump does listen:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/22/the-media-stars-who-double-as-informal-advisers-to-president-trump/
	As he considers limiting White House news briefings to one per week and requiring journalists to submit written questions, President Trump is listening to advisers outside his administration, according to the New York Times. Ironically, a couple of those advisers are members of the media — Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity and former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a Fox News contributor.


This raises a question worthy of investigation: could Russia influence Trump through media figures? Thee idea that Russian propagandists have already invaded prime time isn't so far fetched:


http://time.com/3719129/assad-isis-asset/
	Why Bashar Assad Won't Fight ISIS


http://www.newsweek.com/syria-propaganda-aleppo-assad-536003
	The conflict in Syria has produced plenty of propaganda, as well. Only now the info war is playing out on Facebook and Twitter with a ferocity I’ve never seen. Both sides—Bashar al-Assad’s government forces aided by their Russian and Iranian allies—and the opposition, are involved. The regime has tried to depict the rebels, monolithically, as supporters of the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). The government’s propaganda refers to the opposition as “head choppers” due to ISIS's preferred method of execution. Meanwhile, the rebels have demonized the soldiers fighting for Assad as rapists, killers, monsters. There have committed horrific war crimes, true, but so too has the opposition, though the latter has gone largely unreported.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkSW5i9iwTY
	9/5/13 - Sean Hannity warned his viewers about the "very graphic nature" of what he was about to show before airing the video of rebel forces executing Syrian soldiers that The New York Times featured on its homepage earlier today. He then invited Fox contributors Allen West and Juan Williams to debate just who the U.S. will be helping if we attack Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. After reviewing some of the extremist groups that have infiltrated the civil war in Syrian, West warned against "degrading" the Assad regime only to "upgrade" the opposition. "Which opposition?" he asked. "You have to be very careful of that."


http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/09/10/putin-is-one-who-really-deserves-that-nobel-peace-prize.html
	By K.T. McFarland

	Putin is the one who really deserves that Nobel Peace Prize

	In one of the most deft diplomatic maneuvers of all time, Russia’s President Putin has saved the world from near-certain disaster. He did so without the egoistical but incompetent American president, or his earnest but clueless Secretary of State, even realizing they had been offered a way out of the mess they’d created.


This, in addition to any spies that might have made their way into the White House, would be another avenue of collusion--maybe unwitting on Trump's part--between Trump's camp and Russia.


Third, Russian spies may seek to influence the investigation itself. Such tactics wouldn't be new to Russia's special services--the Soviet spy Samuel Dickstein (http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/samuel-dickstein-congressman-russian-spy-111641), for example, contributed to the excess of the House Un-American Activities Committee, itself an investigation into Soviet espionage. As for where we might find Russian attempts to meddle with investigations into their activities today, former CIA station chief David Hoffman has some ideas:


http://www.npr.org/2017/08/08/542106975/cover-lifted-a-cia-spy-offers-his-take-on-trump-and-russia
	Cover Lifted, A CIA Spy Offers His Take On Trump And Russia

	...Hoffman's long experience observing Russian spies at work leads to a surprising conclusion about one of the most sensational revelations from last year's election: that Trump Tower meeting in June 2016. The one attended by Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, campaign manager Paul Manafort — and Kremlin-connected Russians.

	"To me," Hoffman says, "it pointed to a discoverable influence operation rather than some effort to establish a clandestine channel for collusion."

	Both in NPR's interview and in an op-ed for The New York Times, Hoffman argues the meeting was meant to be discovered, that Putin deliberately left a trail of breadcrumbs from Trump Tower to the Kremlin.


The infamous "dirty dossier" is also alleged to be an attempt confuse investigations into Russia's activities:


https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/parliaments-intelligence-watchdog-to-scrutinise-trump-dossier
	 Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dem peer and former diplomat, said he thought the intelligence agencies would now be trying to get to the bottom of the veracity of the allegations but the dossier showed the hallmarks of the FSB [the modern-day KGB] planting false or heavily embellished information.
 
	“In this hall of mirrors, anybody can indulge their wildest fantasy theory but you have to ask yourself who benefits. Clearly the CIA doesn’t. Clearly Mr Trump doesn’t. But every aspect benefits Russia,” he said.
 
	“It absolutely leaves Britain in a difficult position and Moscow will make the most of that. But it doesn’t mean to say we can do anything about it.”

    Spy Agencies Investigating Claims Trump Advisers Worked With Russian Agents
 
    By Shane Harris, Devlin Barrett and Alan Cullison
 
    U.S. intelligence agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have spent months trying to substantiate explosive claims, compiled by a former Western intelligence official, that Russian government operatives engaged in an extensive conspiracy with advisers to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and employees of his company, people familiar with the matter said.
 
    ...The FBI has found no evidence that he traveled to the Czech Republic, where the meeting allegedly took place in August of last year, officials said.

Regarding potential criminal conduct by Trump, it does look like collusion with Russia was on his mind:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/27/donald-trumps-falsehood-laden-press-conference-annotated/
	QUESTION: (inaudible) Putin (ph) say stay out? Why not say that?
 
	TRUMP: Why do I have to (ph) get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir...


An important aspect of Trump's thinking is that he sees the media as a means of communication for "making deals" (see https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/exqkbp/remembering-john-barron-donald-trumps-spokesman-alter-ego-116 and http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/02/sports/trump-asks-help-in-paying-flutie.html), and so examining his public statements offers insight into his mindset and intent. An extensive treatment of public statements by Trump and other actors in relation to Trump's actions can be found here:

If any deal was struck, Flynn's late December calls with Russian ambassador Kislyak are a good place to look (there are others good places to look mentioned or implied in the documents above). During the calls, Flynn scheduled a meeting between Trump and Putin, and hung up and called back multiple times in one day, suggesting he conferred with others between calls. At the time, the Russian government had publicly threatened retaliation for the sanctions on election meddling, and these sanctions were a topic of discussion between Flynn and Kislyak. The implication is that Trump had conveyed to Moscow the punishment for their meddling would be revisited at a later time, which would be helping them get away with aiding Trump's ascension to the White House, itself potentially an act of war. Widespread reports claimed the calls, if not treason, could constitute a criminal violation of the Logan Act. 

Whatever the underlying conduct, Trump's actions suggest he believed it could put him in legal jeopardy. According to the testimony by Yates, Trump was warned of problems in Flynn's conduct in late January, and the timeline of the events surrounding Yate's warning (see https://pastebin.com/YrPgkGCR, https://pastebin.com/nCwti01C, https://pastebin.com/mjWXFBDr, and https://pastebin.com/J5TTzRCs) is revealing:


	- Jan 24th: The FBI interviews Micheal Flynn on White House grounds. Flynn does not have a lawyer present.

	- Jan 26th: Acting Attorney General Yates warns the White House that Flynn lied about discussing the election meddling sanctions in his calls with Kislyak, and so is vulnerable to blackmail. Circumstances suggest Trump had knowledge and some level of participation in the calls with Kislyak.

	- Jan 27th, morning: The White House comes back to Yates with concerns about the "applicability" of "certain criminal statutes."

	- Jan 27th, evening: Trump requests a private dinner with Comey. Trump asks Comey if he is personally under investigation, and Comey says Trump is not. Comey had told Trump he is not under investigation earlier that month. Trump goes on to ask Comey for his "loyalty," and Comey explains this is inappropriate. Trump asks Comey for his loyalty a second time, and Comey agrees to "honest loyalty."

	- Jan 31st: Trump fires acting Attorney General Yates for "betraying the Justice Department."

	- April 11th: The last conversation between Trump and Comey. Trump asks Comey what he had done about a prior request to "get out" that he is not under investigation, telling Comey "because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know."

	- May 8th: After repeated attempts by the White House to block her, Yates testifies to Congress, revealing much of the above. That same day, Trump asks Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein to write a memo on Comey's misconduct.

	- May 9th: Citing Rosentein's memo, Trump fires Comey.

	- May 10th: Trump has a previously scheduled meeting with Lavrov, telling Lavrov that firing Comey relieved "great pressure because of Russia."


Following Yates' warning, Trump became concerned that he was under investigation. Apparently, Trump decided Yates wasn't "loyal," so he fired her. But Comey told Trump he wasn't under investigation and that he would be "loyal," so Trump kept him on, at least until Trump decided Comey wasn't so "loyal" after all, and that this was getting in the way of his "making deals" with Russia.

(Also, an important note: in this earlier document I guessed Trump's main concern was Flynn being in legal trouble: https://pastebin.com/YrPgkGCR, but this isn't consistent with the facts. Trump's interviews and Comey's testimony say Trump asked if he was under investigation multiple times, and it's doubtful Trump cares about anyone besides himself).

Trump's firing of Yates is of particular interest. Trump's cited Yate's refusal to defend his travel ban as his reason to fire her, but the timing and sudden roll-out of the ban is suspicious:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/01/30/pentagon-begins-compiling-list-of-iraqis-who-could-get-special-consideration-under-trumps-travel-ban/
    Pentagon, caught by surprise by Trump’s travel ban, pushes for some Iraqis to get special consideration
 
 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/
	YATES: No and that was one thing that was of concern to us, is that not only was department leadership not consulted here and beyond department leadership, really the subject matter experts, the national security experts, not only was the department not consulted, we weren't even told about it. I learned about this from media reports.
 
	KLOBUCHAR: So you learned about it after the meeting at the White house Council from the media.
 
	YATES: Right.


http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-news-conference-transcript-20170216-story.html
	QUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...
 
	TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...
 
	QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...
 
	TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.
 
	Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.
 
	We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.
 
	...Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.
 
	You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.
 
	Kelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.
 
	Now nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.
 
	Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.
 

If Trump's motivation to enact the ban "immediately" was truly for the safety of the United States, one has to wonder why he didn't sign the order when it was reportedly ready, on January 25th:


http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/24/trump-to-restrict-immigration-from-several-middle-east-countries-reuters.html
	U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign several executive orders on Wednesday restricting immigration from Syria and six other Middle Eastern or African countries, according to several congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the matter.


Instead, Trump waited until after Yates invited the White House to review Flynn's conduct to enact the ban, after asking her about "applicable criminal statues," and public statements by Trump and his surrogates undermined Trump's own argument that the ban was for public safety and not religiously motivated. All this points to Trump hoping to use the ban as an alibi to fire Yates. Given the global chaos caused by the travel ban, this would be a particularly egregious abuse of power by Trump.

Also of particular interest are Trump's interactions with Comey, and his response to what at least Trump seems to perceive as attempts by Comey to make deals with him and influence him (see https://pastebin.com/mjWXFBDr, https://pastebin.com/01u5Y2W2, and https://pastebin.com/J5TTzRCs). Comey's conduct during and after the election has been strange, to say the least (e.g. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/31/fbi-comey-clinton-email-242213), and merits further investigation. Comey himself may have been a part of Russia's efforts to influence the election, and some of the pastebin documents above make a case for this.

There is more in the documents that I haven't touched on here, and there is more I plan to look at in the future. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. Also, I apologize if I didn't get some of your emails right. Some of Mueller's team have left their old positions at law firms like WilmerHale and Davis Polk & Wardwell, and their old work emails might not work. If you know their current emails and can forward this to them, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading. I hope this helps!

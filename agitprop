	Inspired by the developments in USSR Brecht wrote a number of agitprop plays, praising the bolshevik collectivism (replaceability of each member of the collective in Man Equals Man) and red terror (The Decision). As Herbert Lüthy commented on this period of Brecht's work:


	...In the years of the Cold War and "Red Scare", Brecht was blacklisted by movie studio bosses and interrogated by the House Un-American Activities Committee.[61] Along with about 41 other Hollywood writers, directors, actors and producers, he was subpoenaed to appear before the HUAC in September 1947. Although he was one of 19 witnesses who declared that they would refuse to appear, Brecht eventually decided to testify. 



the man who perfected agitprop theatre participated in a live act

they make Stripling read Communist poems of strength and unity while hardnosing about communism, while Brecht pretends to forget the words


dunno if Stripling was a Soviet spy or not


would be funnier if it were Dickstein

	Dovzhenko's final feature is a biography of the famed Russian horticulturist, even imagining him as an artist of sorts: his pre-Revolutionary hardships bear a certain Tolstoyan quality, up to and including damnation from the church ("Do not turn God's garden into a brothel!"). After the Bolshevik victory, however, Michurin's career is an ever-rising crescendo of successes, culminating in his doctrine's acceptance as the "sole correct line in the biological sciences."

	...All possible means of propaganda were deployed in the Michurinist campaign. In December 1948 the Soviet film industry produced a new color film, Michurin. The author of the screenplay and director of the film was one of the country's most famous directors, Aleksandr Dovzhenko, the music was composed by Dimitrii Shostakovich, and the starring role was played by one of the most popular actors of the time, Grigorii Belov.

	...The propaganda of Michurinism, then, occupied a considerable place in Soviet activities in the international scene in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

	...The film, simply entitled "Michurin," was in color, had a musical score by Shostakovitch, and for the Chinese audience, it was dubbed in Chinese. According to an article in the New York Times, the film was released in the Soviet Union on January 2, 1949, after an unprecedented publicity campaign that was determined "to have the film seen by the maximum audience, especially in the rural areas."

	Michurin faces down every conceivable obstacle, frustration, and disappointment in pursuit of a crazy dream: that one day, fruit gardens will bloom all over his cold, tough country.
	
	...Katashe, a fictional figure, is talking to Michurin about genes, chromosomes and mutations. Michurin answers: 'It is time for biology to get off the pedestal! It should speak the language of the people, and not get lost in the fog!' Two pot-bellied capitalist professors from the United States temp him with bags of gold and promises of glory in America. He waves a violet-scented lily under their noses. ...He tells them his flower is a hybrid of a violet and a lily. 'That's the trouble with the Mendelians, they can't explain hybrids!' The capitalists withdraw, muttering and cursing.

	A priest wags a finger, shouting: 'Do not turn God's garden into a brothel!' The old gardener ignores him. He focuses even deeper in his work.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/agitprop
	The twin strategies of agitation and propaganda were originally elaborated by the Marxist theorist Georgy Plekhanov, who defined propaganda as the promulgation of a number of ideas to an individual or small group and agitation as the promulgation of a single idea to a large mass of people. Expanding on these notions in his pamphlet What Is to Be Done? (1902), Vladimir Lenin stated that the propagandist, whose primary medium is print, explains the causes of social inequities such as unemployment or hunger, while the agitator, whose primary medium is speech, seizes on the emotional aspects of these issues to arouse his audience to indignation or action. Agitation is thus the use of political slogans and half-truths to exploit the grievances of the public and thereby to mold public opinion and mobilize public support. Propaganda, by contrast, is the reasoned use of historical and scientific arguments to indoctrinate the educated and so-called “enlightened” members of society, such as party members.

	These modern conveyances functioned like moving posters with exterior decorations of heroic figures and folk art motifs accompanied by simple slogans. The trains and ships brought revolutionary leaflets, agitators, newsreels, and agitki (short propaganda films), among other items. Agit-trains were reinstituted during World War II to convey propaganda to forces at the front.

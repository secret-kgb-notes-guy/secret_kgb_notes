	“I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Mr. Trump said, according to the document, which was read to The New York Times by an American official. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”

	Mr. Trump added, “I’m not under investigation.”


- Fired Comey
- He's crazy
- Faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.
- "I' not under investigation"


how the fuck do you read that?

It's like it's desgned to be confusing/divisive


Why will the media find and release the shitty dossier, but not any of these transcripts?

	President Trump's Full Interview With Lester Holt: Firing Of James Comey


	TRUMP: Look, he's a showboat. He's a grandstander.

	The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that, everybody knows that.

	You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil -- less than a year ago. It hasn't recovered from that.


This supposed to be his reason for firing him? or a list

------


	HOLT: Monday you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

	TRUMP: Right.

	HOLT: Did you ask for a recommendation?

	TRUMP: What I did is I was going to fire Comey. My decision. It was not...

	HOLT: You had made the decision before they came into your office (ph).

	TRUMP: I -- I was going to fire Comey. I -- there's no good time to do it, by the way.


dodges question, says (I think) wanted to fire Comey before the Rosenstein reccomendation


------


	They...

	HOLT: Because in your letter, you said...

	(CROSSTALK)

	TRUMP: They -- they were...

	HOLT: ...I -- I accepted -- accepted their recommendations.

	TRUMP: Yeah, well, they also...

	HOLT: So, you had already made the decision.

	TRUMP: Oh, I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.

	HOLT: So, there was...


http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/332630-full-letter-deputy-attorney-general-recommends-trump


Right, Trump accepted the letter from Rosenstein, but he had alreaddy decided to fire Comey beforehand


------



https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html	He had made a recommendation. But regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it

	And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself -- I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.

	And the reason they should've won it is the electoral college is almost impossible for a Republican to win. It's very hard because you start off at such a disadvantage. So, everybody was thinking they should've won the election. This was an excuse for having lost an election.

	HOLT: But were -- are you angry...

	(CROSSTALK)

	HOLT: ...angry with Mr. Comey because of his Russia investigation?

	TRUMP: I just want somebody that's competent. I am a big fan of the FBI. I love the FBI.

	HOLT: But were you a fan of...

	(CROSSTALK)

	TRUMP: ...people of the FBI.

	HOLT: him taking up that investigation?

	TRUMP: I think that -- about the Hillary Clinton investigation?

	HOLT: No, about -- about the Russian investigation and possible...

	TRUMP: No, I don't care...

	HOLT: ...links between...

	TRUMP: Look -- look, let me tell you. As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly.

	When I did this now, I said I probably maybe will confuse people. Maybe I'll expand that -- you know, I'll lengthen the time because it should be over with. It should -- in my opinion, should've been over with a long time ago because it -- all it is an excuse.

	But I said to myself I might even lengthen out the investigation. But I have to do the right thing for the American people.

	He's the wrong man for that position.


wtf is he talking about?

Does he honestly think FBI invsetigations have time limits or something?

what a fucking moron


or is he saying he complicated the investigation?


Ok it sounds like, maybe, he knew or suspected that firing the FBI director would affect the Russia investigation, but "have to do the right thing for the American people"


-------

	HOLT: Let me ask you about your termination letter to Mr. Comey. You write, "I greatly appreciate you informing me on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation." Why did you put that in there?

	TRUMP: Because he told me that. I mean, he told me that.

	HOLT: He told you, you weren't under investigation with...

	TRUMP: Yeah, and I...

	HOLT: ...regard to the Russian investigation.

	TRUMP: ...I've heard that -- I've heard that from others. I think...

	HOLT: Was it in a phone call? Did you meet face to face?


Maybe Trump didn't want it to look like he was firing Comey for the Russia investigation? would be consciousness of guilt I think?


------

	TRUMP: I actually asked him, yes. I said if it's possible, would you let me know am I under investigation. He said you are not under investigation.

	HOLT: But he's -- he's given sworn testimony that there's an ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign and possible collusion with the Russian government. You were the centerpiece of the Trump campaign.


Holt doesn't believe him


------

	HOLT: Did you ask him to drop the investigation?

	TRUMP: No, never.

	HOLT: Did anyone from the White House...

	TRUMP: No. In fact, I want the investigation speeded up...



the "I want the investigation speeded up" checks out with Comey's testimony, first part clearly does not...


------


	HOLT: Did anyone from the White House ask him to -- to end the investigation?

	TRUMP: No, no. Why would we do that?


Does he show he knows its wrong to do that here?

defense for Trump could be he knew asking FBI to drop an investigation is wrong/illegal, but didn't know is statements would be interpreted that way


------

	TRUMP: Not that I know of. Look, I want to find out if there was a problem with an election having to do with Russia. Or by the way any -- but -- any -- anybody else. Any other country.

	And I want that to be so strong and so good. And I want it to happen.

	I also want to have a really competent, capable director. He's not. He's a show boater.

	He's not my man or not my man. I didn't appoint him. He was appointed long before me.

	But I want somebody who's going to do a great job. And I will tell you, we're looking at candidates right now who could be spectacular. And that's what I want for the FBI.


Makes it harder to say "Trump said he fired me beaucse of the RUssia investigation," among other statements by him


also "not my man" and "I didn't appoint him" is telling--Trump thinks Comey part of Obama conspiracy to ruin him?


------


	HOLT: What you said a moment ago about supporting the idea of investigation. A lot of people would find it hard to believe that the man who just said that tweeted very recently it's a total hoax. It's a taxpayer charade.

	TRUMP: Oh, I think that looking into me and the campaign -- look, I have nothing to do -- this was set up by the Democrats. There is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.

	The other thing is the Russians did not affect the vote. And everybody seems to think that.

	HOLT: There is an investigation underway though, an FBI investigation. Is that a charade?

	TRUMP: Well, I don't know if it's an FBI or if it's -- there's so many investigations. I don't know if it's an FBI investigation or if it's Congress, if it's the Senate and the House...

	HOLT: Well, James Comey testified there was an FBI investigation...

	TRUMP: Well, yeah, but I think they're also helping the House and the Senate. So, you probably have FBI. But you have House, you have Senate. They have other investigations.

	HOLT: But when you put out tweets it's a total hoax. It's a taxpayer charade. And you're looking for a new FBI director, are you not sending that person a message to lay off?

	TRUMP: No, I'm not doing that. I think that we have to get back to work. But I want to find out -- I want to get to the bottom.

	If Russia hacked -- if Russia did anything having to do with our election, I want to know about it.


Trump says he "doesn't know" if it's an FBI investigation or not

lying? saying he didn't know if there is an FBI investigation or not, then kindof changing his story


Trump sounds like he's lying when he says he supports the investigation


Basically getting out of him is he is saying he wants the investigation done quickly so it will clear him


------


	HOLT: Well, there's already -- there's already intelligence from virtually every intelligence agency that yes, that happened (ph).

	TRUMP: I'll tell you this. If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it's a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it. And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen.

	HOLT: Were you angry with James Comey when he went public and said he can't support your unsubstantiated charges of wiretapping -- that your -- your predecessor wire tapped you?

	TRUMP: I was surprised he said it, but I wasn't angry. There's a big thing going on right now which is spying. And it's -- you can scroll to anything you want.


Trump lying? he is always fighitng the intel community


Does Trump honestly believe deep state Obama operatives are out to get him? seems like it



------


https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html


	HOLT: And what about when he went public and said that there was in fact an FBI investigation looking at your campaign and Russia? Did that anger you?

	I -- I ask that because...

	TRUMP: Well, I -- I -- you know I have that...

	HOLT: ...there's a -- a sense that you...

	TRUMP: ...I have that...

	HOLT: ...that there was a building anger.

	TRUMP: No, no, no. I -- I know every once in a while, you'll see that in the newspaper, anger somebody will report or they'll have false sources that maybe don't exist because of the media -- the way the media is. No.

	I will tell you, I think that -- I want very simply a great FBI director.


is Trump lying?

	The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.
	5:57 AM - 10 May 2017


http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/332704-trump-cnn-report-that-roger-stone-recommended-firing-comey-fake-news
	CNN’s Gloria Borger reported Wednesday morning that Stone was among those who recommended Trump fire Comey.

	Stone is among the Trump associates being scrutinized by the FBI as part of its investigation into Russian election interference and links between members of Trump's campaign and Moscow.


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/10/comey-firing-trump-russia-238192
	He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia. He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn’t disappear and demanded they speak out for him. He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said. 


I can believe it

	But the fallout seemed to take the White House by surprise. Trump made a round of calls around 5 p.m., asking for support from senators. White House officials believed it would be a “win-win” because Republicans and Democrats alike had had problems with the FBI director, one person briefed on the administration’s deliberations said. 


a set-up? reminds me of Yaun Shikai declaring himself emperor kindof

just do something completely stupid and destroy yourself

	...On Twitter, Stone signaled praise for the move by posting an image of Trump from “The Apprentice” saying, “You’re fired.”

	Stone declined to comment Tuesday night but said he was enjoying a fine cigar. 


hmmm

	3:45 AM - 31 May 2017 


does sound like he thinks Comey is out to get him. And Trump kept bringing up leaks in his convos with Comey.


So Trump paranoid (like Nixon!), thinks  conspiracy in USIC of "leakers" out to get him, undermine him, Russia story is "fake news" witchhunt, and he thinks Comey is in on it

says he knows/suspects firing Comey will "lengthen" the Russia investigation, claims he really wants it to be happen quicker, and that his reason for firing Comey was that Comey did a bad job of leading FBI


real reason to fire could be that Trump just thinks Comey is out to get him (which is true!)


Trump also seems to be very cognizant/sensitive of the Russia investigation, especially the dirty dossier.

So, is Comey right that Trump fired him because of the Russia investigation?

maybe, more like, Trump fired him because of how Trump thought Comey would handle the Russia investigation

Still has a good alibi for firing Comey for the email investigation in any case


https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/872059997429022722
	The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.

	I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'
	5:29 AM - 11 Jun 2017 


James Comey will leak more than you could possibly imagine


-----


So, if Trump is paranoid and fires Comey because he thinks Comey is out to get him (with the Russia investigation? others?), then fires Comey because of that and lies about it, but it turns out he was right all along...


is that legal?


(...is that even true?)


if he honestly thinks the Russia investigation is fake/news or played up, can that be obstruction of justice?


on the other hand, if he thinks there's something fishy in his tax returns...


but if he honestly thinks Comey is a crazy nutjob out to get him, firing doesn't seem like obstruction of justice. Trump says: I know it will lengthen investigation, want to shorten it



-----

Trump definitely suspects intel community of leaking against him:


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html
	JAN. 11, 2017

	TRUMP: All right, but you know what, it could have been others also.

	QUESTION: But why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?

	TRUMP: Well, I think it’s pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it’s pretty sad. First of all, it’s illegal. You know, these are — these are classified and certified meetings and reports.

	I’ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody’s leaking it out. So, there’s — maybe it’s my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it’s them. And what I did is I said I won’t tell anybody. I’m going to have a meeting and I won’t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.

	And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn’t know — I didn’t tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.

	So, I don’t want that — I don’t want that. It’s very unfair to the country. It’s very unfair to our country; what’s happened. That report should have never — first of all, it shouldn’t have been printed because it’s not worth the paper it’s written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that.

	I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.


perhaps not as dumb as commonly believed either.

Isn't this from an episode of game of thrones or something?


also trump is *really* paranoid

	HOLT: And will you expect if they would -- they would continue on with this investigation...

	TRUMP: Oh, yeah, sure. I expect that.


Does he? maybe would expect investigation to be finished qickly find no wrongdoing


------


	HOLT: General Flynn is a part of this investigation as you know. Sally Yates recently testified that the White House was notified that he had been compromised, he was at risk of...

	TRUMP: Yeah.

	HOLT: ...of being blackmailed. It was 18 days later that he was finally fired.

	During that 18 days, he had access, I assume, to all the nation's top secrets. One day you meet on the issue of Comey...

	TRUMP: Right.

	HOLT: ...and you fire him in a humiliating way, while he's sitting in a room with his colleagues and it's appearing on the TV.

	TRUMP: Because my White House counsel Don McGahn came back to me and did not sound like an emergency of any -- he didn't make it sound like he was, you know -- and she actually didn't make it sound that way, either in the hearings the other day. Like it had to be done immediately.


A lie? Yates did make it sound that way in the hearings.


What did McGahn say to Trump?


------

	...This man has served for many years. He's a general. He's a, in my opinion, a very good person.

	I believe that it would be very unfair to hear from somebody who we don't even know and immediately run out and fire a general. Now...

	HOLT: The acting Attorney General at the time.

	TRUMP: My White House counsel came to me. They had, I believe, two meetings. And we ultimately fired -- but we fired for a different reason.

	HOLT: You're talking about General Flynn?

	TRUMP: General Flynn, yes.

	HOLT: Because -- because of lying to the vice president.


"we ultimate fired him for a different reason" different than what? blackmail?


	TRUMP: Yeah, but everything plays in -- everything plays into it. But we fired him because he said something to the vice president that was not so.


I guess he gets that?


also "very unfair to hear from somebody we don't even know and immediately run out and fire a general."

Did Trump think Yates wanted him to fire Flynn? either way sounds like he didn't take her warning seriously.


Probably because he's sexist lol


	HOLT: Did you know that he had had -- that received payments from the Russian government? That he had...

	TRUMP: No.

	HOLT: ...received payments from the Turkish government?

	TRUMP: No, but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration. And his -- and -- and this is something they never want to report.

	He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have. And I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.

	You know, you're talking about 2015. I don't know that I knew him in 2015.


Trump blames Obama of course

Blame Obama for setting him up?

	HOLT: The Senate Intelligence Committee wants information from the Treasury Department's financial crimes unit about your finances, your -- your businesses' finance.

	TRUMP: Yeah.

	HOLT: Can you tell us whether you, your family, your businesses, your surrogates have accepted any investments, any loans from Russians individuals...

	TRUMP: Yeah, in fact I just sent a letter...

	HOLT: ...or institutions?

	TRUMPS: ...to Lindsay Graham from one of the most prestigious law firms in the country -- a tremendous, highly rated law firm -- that I have nothing to do with Russia. I have no investments in Russia, none whatsoever.

	I don't have property in Russia -- a lot of people thought I owned office buildings in Moscow. I don't have property in Russia. And I am in very -- I -- I mean I -- I'm in total compliance in every way.


Doesn't his org have investiments in Russia? Trump Jr. said so


------

	I built a great company, but I'm not involved with Russia


hmmm



	I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago.

	I had the Miss Universe pageant, which I owned for quite a while. I had it in Moscow a long time ago.

	But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.


Tax lawyers say otherwise

	Now, this is a public meeting. Because, you know, when you cover this, the people watching may say oh, he met with Lavrov.

	Well, this was announced that I'm meeting with Lavrov. Just like a number of days ago, I spoke -- had a very good conversation -- very public in the sense that everybody knew this was taking place.


	...But when I spoke with Putin, he asked me whether or not I would see Lavrov. Now, what do I -- should I say no, I'm not going to see him? I said, I will see him.

	During that discussion with Lavrov, I think we had a great discussion having to do with Syria, having to do with the Ukraine. And maybe, that discussion will lead to a lot less people getting killed and will lead ultimately to peace.


Is that how Trump sees it?


no different from Obama


wants to make "friends" and have "peace" with people who are already trying to kill us

	• On Tuesday, the White House said Trump had fired Comey solely on the recommendation of the deputy attorney general, who sharply criticized the handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.

	• That explanation was repeated multiple times on Wednesday by Vice President Mike Pence, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and other White House officials. "He provided strong leadership ... to act on the recommendation of the deputy attorney general," Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill.

	• But late on Wednesday -- after earlier meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US ambassador Sergey Kislyak -- Trump said he had fired Comey "because he wasn't doing a good job." 

aren't those basically the same?


	Separately, the acting FBI director Andrew McCabe denied Trump's suggestion that Comey had lost the support of rank-and-file employees at the bureau. McCabe told a Senate hearing Thursday that Comey enjoyed "broad support" at the FBI.

interesting, although news some news reports (fox news) back up Trump


	But Trump's admission that the Russia investigation was on his mind when he fired Comey prompted suggestions that he could be accused of obstructing justice. 

	"If the President's real reason for firing Comey was to derail or obstruct the FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and Trump associates to influence the outcome of the presidential election, this could warrant serious legal consequences," wrote Jimmy Gurulé, a law professor at Notre Dame and a former under secretary for enforcement at the US Department of the Treasury, in an article for CNN.


consciousness of guilt? except the President doesn't think he's guilty? basically he was saying he knows the optics are bad

	Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee told CNN, "I think that the firing was all about the Russia investigation."

	"He fired the top cop on that investigation, and I think no one believes this was about Hillary Clinton's emails. I think it was all about the Russia case," he added.

	Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he had not relied solely on the advice from the Justice Department’s top two leaders in making his decision. And, for the first time, he explicitly referenced the F.B.I.’s investigation into his administration’s ties to Russia in defending Mr. Comey’s firing.


shit reporting


Trump even said earlier he thought Comey gave Hillary a pass, Rosenstein I guess confirmed what he thought

	Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?

	4:48 AM - 11 Jan 2017


Trump actually thinks intelligence agencies leaked the dossier?

	Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!

	KING: ...yourself, Admiral Rogers, Director Brennan, and General Clapper went to Trump tower to meet with President Trump. The media reports are that at the end of that meeting, Director Comey, you presented president-elect Trump with a copy of the now infamous or famous dossier. And I don't know how many people were in the room, but within hours, that was leaked to the media and that gave the media the excuse or the rationale to publish almost the entire dossier.

	Do you -- does that violate any law? I mean you were at a classified briefing with the president-elect of the United States and it had to be a very, very small universe of people who knew that you handed them that dossier and it was leaked out within hours. Are you making any effort to find out who leaked it and do you believe that constitute a criminal violation?

	COMEY: I can't say, Mr. King except I can answer in general.

	FBI fear of leaks drove decision on emails linked to Clinton: sources

 	FBI Director James Comey was driven in part by a fear of leaks from within his agency when he decided to tell Congress the FBI was investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton, law enforcement sources said on Thursday.





intresting that Comey himself fears leaks--adding to the "Comey a hypocrite/double-standard" takedown I presume they are planning?

    Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia

    The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American!

    Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View – "The NSA & FBI…should not interfere in our politics…and is" Very serious situation for USA

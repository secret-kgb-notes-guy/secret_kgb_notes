Trump told Comey he wanted his "loyalty," expressed his hopes that Comey could "see his way to letting Flynn go," asked Comey to "lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation over his dealmaking before firing him. For the question of "what was Trump's intent?" behind these actions and others, Comey and Trump give very different interpretations--never mind that they can't even agree on the facts.


Trump's story:


Trump decided to fire Comey upon a "very strong recommendation" from Rosenstein and the Attorney General, but also was going to fire him anyway. Trump is aware of the bad-optics of firing Comey [1][2] due to the Russia investigation, but Trump figured the whole Russia story is just a made-up excuse by sour Democrats [3]. Trump realized that firing Comey might make the Russia investigation take longer, but he had to do the right thing for the American people [4]. Besides, the investigation was just an excuse that should have been over with a long time ago [2], and he wanted the investigation to be sped-up anyway [5].

Other than the DOJ's recommendation, Trump has a long list of reason to fire Comey. For one, Comey is a show-boater and grandstander [6] who had put the FBI in turmoil [7] and bruised public trust in the FBI [8]. Comey did a poor job at the May 3rd Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing, and this is probably why the DOJ wrote their letter [9]. Comey made misstatements during this testimony which the FBI had to correct, which rarely happens [10]. Trump cherishes the FBI and understands they are very special, but because of what happened to the Clinton campaign (and even to Trump's much more successful campaign), the FBI lost that special reputation during the 2016 election [11]. When Trump fired him, Comey was very unpopular, and both Democrats and Republicans were saying terrible things about him [12]. On top of that, Comey is an Obama appointee, and is not Trump's man [13]. In the end, Trump wants someone who's capable and can be a great FBI director, and that's just not Comey [14]. He's the wrong man for that position, and the wrong man for the American people [15]. 

Trump wants the Russia investigation to be absolutely done properly [16]. Neither Trump nor anybody else from the White House asked Comey to drop the Russia investigation [17], and Trump doesn't know of any surrogates who asked on behalf of the White House [18]. Trump wants the investigation to be good and strong, so we can get to the bottom of this [19], but he maintains that the Russia investigation was a set-up by the Democrats [20]. Trump says there is no collusion between his campaign and the Russians, and the Russians did not affect the vote [21]. Besides the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and selling a home to a wealthy Russian, Trump himself has nothing to do with Russia [22].

Trump did not urge Comey in any way to back down the investigation into Micheal Flynn [23]. Trump was aware of Yate's warning about Flynn, but he didn't think it was that big of a deal. Trump says the White House Counsel, Don McGahn, didn't make the problems with Flynn sound like any kind of emergency or anything urgent, and neither did Yates in her Congressional hearing [24]. Trump thought it would be unfair to immediately fire Flynn, a General and a good person, after hearing from somebody he doesn't even know [25]. But ultimately, Trump fired Flynn because he lied to the Vice President [26].

Comey asked Trump to meet at the Jan 27th dinner because Comey wanted to keep his job. [27] This was the first time Comey told Trump he is not under investigation [28]. Trump never asked Comey for his loyalty [29], and did not feel that Comey contradicting his wiretapping claims was a sign of disloyalty [30].

Trump was surprised when Comey publicly declared there was no evidence for his wiretapping claims, but he wasn't angry [31]. Nor was Trump angry when Comey revealed the FBI was investigating his campaign for colluding with Russia. In fact, newspaper stories saying Trump was angry might have used false sources, or even sources that don't exist [32].

Trump never thought about the optics of firing Comey the day before meeting with Lavrov, because creating jobs, strength, security, and strong borders are more important than optics [33]. The meeting was a public meeting, and very public since Trump announced it and everybody knew about it [34]. Putin asked Trump to set up the meeting [35].

When I did this now, I said I probably maybe will confuse people. Maybe I'll expand that -- you know, I'll lengthen the time because it should be over with. It should -- in my opinion, should've been over with a long time ago because it -- all it is an excuse.

" And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself -- I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."

TRUMP: Look, he's a showboat. He's a grandstander.

...I also want to have a really competent, capable director. He's not. He's a show boater.

The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that, everybody knows that.

You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil -- less than a year ago. It hasn't recovered from that.


8. http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/fbi-james-comey-fired-letter/index.html
It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.

Then he had the very poor performance on Wednesday.  That was a poor, poor performance.  So poor, in fact, that I believe — and you’d have to ask him, because I don’t like to speak for other people — but I believe that’s why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter.


10. http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/transcript-president-trump-colombian-president-santos-presser/
	And then, on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to readjust the record, which many people have never seen before, because there were misstatements made.  And I thought that was something that was terrible.


11. http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/transcript-president-trump-colombian-president-santos-presser/
We need a great director of the FBI.  I cherish the FBI.  It’s special.  All over the world, no matter where you go, the FBI is special.  The FBI has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even you could say — directly or indirectly — with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.


12. http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/transcript-president-trump-colombian-president-santos-presser/
Director Comey was very unpopular with most people.  I actually thought when I made that decision — and I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know, from the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  But when I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision, because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side — not only the Republican side — they were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.

TRUMP: No, I don't care...

HOLT: ...links between...

TRUMP: Look -- look, let me tell you. As far as I'm concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly.


17. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: Did you ask him to drop the investigation?

TRUMP: No, never.

HOLT: Did anyone from the White House...

TRUMP: No. In fact, I want the investigation speeded up...


18. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: Any -- any surrogates on behalf of the White House?

TRUMP: Not that I know of. Look, I want to find out if there was a problem with an election having to do with Russia. Or by the way any -- but -- any -- anybody else. Any other country.

And I want that to be so strong and so good. And I want it to happen.


19. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: But when you put out tweets it's a total hoax. It's a taxpayer charade. And you're looking for a new FBI director, are you not sending that person a message to lay off?

TRUMP: No, I'm not doing that. I think that we have to get back to work. But I want to find out -- I want to get to the bottom.


20. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html

TRUMP: Oh, I think that looking into me and the campaign -- look, I have nothing to do -- this was set up by the Democrats.

There is no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians.

The other thing is the Russians did not affect the vote. And everybody seems to think that.

TRUMPS: ...to Lindsay Graham from one of the most prestigious law firms in the country -- a tremendous, highly rated law firm -- that I have nothing to do with Russia. I have no investments in Russia, none whatsoever.

I don't have property in Russia -- a lot of people thought I owned office buildings in Moscow. I don't have property in Russia. And I am in very -- I -- I mean I -- I'm in total compliance in every way.

Now, I have to tell you, I file documents -- hundreds of pages worth of documents with the Federal Elections Bureau. Everybody's seen that.

I built a great company, but I'm not involved with Russia. I have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago.

I had the Miss Universe pageant, which I owned for quite a while. I had it in Moscow a long time ago.

But other than that, I have nothing to do with Russia.


23. http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/transcript-president-trump-colombian-president-santos-presser/
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  In the light of a very busy news week, a lot of people would like to get to the bottom of a couple of things, give you a chance to go on record here.  Did you at any time urge former FBI Director James Comey in any way, shape, or form to close or to back down the investigation into Michael Flynn?

And also as you look back —

PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No.  No.  Next question.


24. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: General Flynn is a part of this investigation as you know. Sally Yates recently testified that the White House was notified that he had been compromised, he was at risk of...

TRUMP: Yeah.

HOLT: ...of being blackmailed. It was 18 days later that he was finally fired.

During that 18 days, he had access, I assume, to all the nation's top secrets. One day you meet on the issue of Comey...

TRUMP: Right.

HOLT: ...and you fire him in a humiliating way, while he's sitting in a room with his colleagues and it's appearing on the TV.

TRUMP: Because my White House counsel Don McGahn came back to me and did not sound like an emergency of any -- he didn't make it sound like he was, you know -- and she actually didn't make it sound that way, either in the hearings the other day. Like it had to be done immediately.

This man has served for many years. He's a general. He's a, in my opinion, a very good person.


25. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
I believe that it would be very unfair to hear from somebody who we don't even know and immediately run out and fire a general. Now...

HOLT: The acting Attorney General at the time.


26. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
TRUMP: My White House counsel came to me. They had, I believe, two meetings. And we ultimately fired -- but we fired for a different reason.

HOLT: You're talking about General Flynn? TRUMP: General Flynn, yes.

TRUMP: Yeah, but everything plays in -- everything plays into it. But we fired him because he said something to the vice president that was not so.


27. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
TRUMP: I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House...

...very early on. That dinner was arranged. I think he asked for the dinner.

And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I'll, you know, consider. We'll see what happens.


28. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
TRUMP: Then, during a phone call, he said it. And then, during another phone call he said it.

So, he said it once at dinner and then he said it twice during phone calls.


29. http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/05/12/hannity-trump-should-replace-wh-briefings-with-tweets.html
PIRRO: People suggest that the question that, apparently, The New York Times is selling, that you asked Comey whether or not you had his loyalty, was possibly inappropriate. Could you see how they would think that?

TRUMP: No, I don't think -- I read that article. I don't think it's inappropriate, number one. It isn't--

PIRRO: Did you ask that question?

TRUMP: No. No, I didn't. But I don't think it would be a bad question to ask. I think loyalty to the country, loyalty to United States is important. You know, I mean, it depends on how you define loyalty, number one. And number two, I don't know how that got there because I didn't ask that question.

PIRRO: What about the idea that in a tweet, you said that there might be tape recordings?

TRUMP: Well, that I can't talk about. I won't talk about that. All I want is for Comey to be honest, and I hope he will be, and I'm sure he will be, I hope.


30. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: You didn't take that as a sign that this loyalty that he came out and contradicted you?

(CROSSTALK)

TRUMP: No, I didn't -- I didn't -- I don't think of it as loyalty. I mean, I want whoever the director is, I want him to do the right thing.


31. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: Were you angry with James Comey when he went public and said he can't support your unsubstantiated charges of wiretapping -- that your -- your predecessor wire tapped you?

	TRUMP: I was surprised he said it, but I wasn't angry. There's a big thing going on right now which is spying. And it's -- you can scroll to anything you want.


32. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: And what about when he went public and said that there was in fact an FBI investigation looking at your campaign and Russia? Did that anger you?

I -- I ask that because...

TRUMP: Well, I -- I -- you know I have that...

HOLT: ...there's a -- a sense that you...

TRUMP: ...I have that...

HOLT: ...that there was a building anger.

TRUMP: No, no, no. I -- I know every once in a while, you'll see that in the newspaper, anger somebody will report or they'll have false sources that maybe don't exist because of the media -- the way the media is. No.


33. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: Did you worry at all when you made the decision to fire Comey when you did, the day before Lavrov was here in the White House and -- and the Russian Ambassador. Did you think through the optics of a way this would look?

TRUMP: I never thought about -- it was set up a while ago. And frankly, I could've waited. But what difference does it make?

I'm not looking for cosmetics. I'm looking to do a great job for the country.


34. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
Now, this is a public meeting. Because, you know, when you cover this, the people watching may say oh, he met with Lavrov.

Well, this was announced that I'm meeting with Lavrov. Just like a number of days ago, I spoke -- had a very good conversation -- very public in the sense that everybody knew this was taking place.


35. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
 But when I spoke with Putin, he asked me whether or not I would see Lavrov. Now, what do I -- should I say no, I'm not going to see him? I said, I will see him.


35. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
TRUMP: I was surprised he said it, but I wasn't angry. There's a big thing going on right now which is spying. And it's -- you can scroll to anything you want.

The unmasking and the spying. And to me, that's the big story right now. That's a very, very big story.


Comey's story:


Comey was confused by Trump's shifting explanations on why he was fired. Trump repeatedly told Comey he was doing a great job, heard great things about him from the Attorney General and others, and hoped he would stay as Director [1]. Trump was lying when he said Comey was a poor leader of the FBI and that the FBI was in disarray and had lost confidence in Comey [2].

At first, Comey didn't know that Trump fired him because of the Russia investigation, but after watching his interview with Lester Holt, Comey saw that Trump said he fired him because of the Russia investigation, and Comey takes him at his word [3][4]. Trump fired Comey to change how the investigation was being conducted [5][6].

Other than media reports, Comey is not aware of any attempts by Trump to reach out to Admiral Rogers, DNI Coats, or DCI Pompeo to publicly exonerate Trump or intervene with the FBI regarding the FBI's investigation [7].

Comey first met Trump on Janurary 6th, when he briefed Trump on the "dodgy dossier." Part of the reason to brief Trump on the dossier was that Trump might be being blackmailed by the Russians [8]. During this briefing, Comey let Trump know he was not under investigation [9].

Trump called Comey on March 30 and described the Russia investigation as a "cloud" that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country [10]. Comey interpreted Trump as saying the investigation was draining his time and energy and making it harder for him to focus on other priorities [11]. Trump expressed to Comey that he had nothing to do with Russia and wanted the FBI to do the Russia investigation and get all the facts out. Trump specifically asked Comey to get out that he personally was not under investigation [12], and expressed that it would be good to find out if his surrogates did something wrong or clear their names too [13].

Immediately after this, Trump turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director McCabe and mentioned he hadn't brought up "the McCabe thing" because Comey said McCabe was honorable, even though McCabe had accepted Campaign donations from the Clintons under suspicious circumstances [14]. Trump said he was rough on McCabe on the campaign trail, and asked Comey how McCabe was going to be with Trump as President [15]. Trump finished the call by emphasizing his problems with "the cloud" and expressing his hopes Comey could find a way to make public Trump wasn't being investigated. Comey told Trump he'd see what we can do [16][17]. Comey did not tell Trump that the FBI and DOJ didn't want to publicly reveal Trump was not under investigation, in part because that would create a duty to correct if that changed [18][19].

Trump asked Comey "lift the cloud" during the March 30 call and complained about the "cloud" again during an April 11th phone call. Comey interpreted "the cloud" to mean the Russia investigation in general [20], and Comey understood Trump to be requesting that the Russia investigation be dropped [21]. The March 30 phone call was the third time Comey let Trump know he was not under investigation [22].

Comey thinks he told Trump he was not under investigation during the April 11th call too [23]. During that call, Trump wanted to know what Comey had done about his request to make public that Trump was not under investigation [24]. Trump tried to remind Comey that he had "been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know." Comey was curious what Trump meant by "that thing" but didn't ask him [25]. At the end of the call, Comey told Trump to take his request to Boente and Trump agreed [26].

There have been lots of news stories about the Russia investigation and collusion that get the facts wrong [27]. Specifically, one could characterize the February 14th New York Times story "Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence" as "almost entirely wrong." [28] The story alleged extensive electronic surveillance, and that upset Comey so much that he surveyed the intelligence community to see if he was missing something. Comey sought out Republican and Democrat Senators to let them know the story had factual errors [29].

Comey believes Trump asked him to drop the investigation into Flynn [30]. When Trump asked Comey to "let Flynn go" at the February 14th Oval Office meeting, Comey perceived this as an order [31][32]. If Comey did what Trump wanted, he would have dropped any open criminal investigation into Flynn's contacts with the Russians [33]. Comey believes it is unlikely that closing the investigation into Flynn would have impeded the Russia investigation [34].

Comey did not in any way initiate the Jan 27th dinner meeting with Trump [35], and Trump was not describing the situation accurately when he said Comey "wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on" [32]. Trump began the dinner by asking if Comey wanted to stay as FBI director, then asked Comey for loyalty specifically in the context of asking him to stay. Trump had already asked Comey to stay three times, and Comey saw Trump's request for loyalty as a way to get something in exchange for letting Comey keep his job and create a patronage relationship [36]. At the end of the dinner, Trump asked Comey for "honest loyalty, and Comey went along with it [37][38].

During the dinner, Trump reacted strongly to the "dodgy dossier" and told Comey he was tempted to order him to investigate it. The January 27th dinner was the second time Comey told Trump he was not under investigation [39], and Trump did not ask Comey to back off the Flynn investigation at the dinner [40].


1. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
But then the explanations, the shifting explanations, confused me and increasingly concerned me. They confused me because the president and I had had multiple conversations about my job, both before and after he took office, and he had repeatedly told me I was doing a great job, and he hoped I would stay. And I had repeatedly assured him that I did intend to stay and serve out the years of my term. He told me repeatedly that he had talked to lots of people about me, including our current Attorney General, and had learned that I was doing a great job, and that I was extremely well-liked by the FBI workforce. 


2. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.


3. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, I just want you to know that I have great respect for you. Senator Cornyn and I sit on the judiciary committee and we have the occasion to have you before us. You're a man of strength and I regret the situations we all find ourselves in. I just want to say that. Let me begin with one overarching question. Why do you believe you were fired?

COMEY: I guess I don't know for sure. I believe — I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didn't know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe he's saying something that's not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 


4. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation, and learned again from the media that he was telling privately other parties that my firing had relieved great pressure on the Russian investigation.


5. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
FEINSTEIN: Do you believe the Russia investigation played a role?

COMEY: In why I was fired?

FEINSTEIN: Yes.

COMEY: Yes. I've seen the president say so. 


6. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
COMEY: I don't know that I can agree to that level of detail. There's no doubt it's a fair judgment. It's my judgment I was fired because of the Russia investigation.  I was fired in some way to change — or the endeavor was to change the way the Russia investigation is being conducted. That is a very big deal. 


7. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
REED: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Director Comey. There have been press reports that the president, in addition to asking to you drop the Flynn investigation has asked other senior intelligence officials to take steps which would tend to undermine the investigation of Russia. There are reports that he's asked Dan Coats and Mike Rogers to make public statements exonerating him or taking the pressure off of him. And also reports about Admiral Rogers and Director Pompeo to intervene and reach out to the FBI to ask them. Are you aware of any of these -- do you have any information with respect to any of these allegations?

COMEY: I don't. I'm aware of the public reporting but I had no contact. No conversation with any of those leaders about that subject. 


8. http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/james-comey-memos-testimony/index.html
The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.

SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, let me begin by thanking you for your voluntary compliance with our request to appear before this committee and assist us in this very important investigation. I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that assurance. Is that correct?

COMEY: That's correct.

On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. 


11. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
FEINSTEIN: You describe two phone calls that you received from president trump. One on March 30th and one on April 


12. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295   
LANKFORD: I was interested in your comment that you made as well that the president said to you if there were some satellite associates of his that did something wrong, it would be good to find that out. Did the president seem to talk to you specifically on March 30th saying I'm frustrated that the word is not getting out that I'm under investigation. But if there are people in my circle that are, let's finish the investigation, is that how you took it?

COMEY: Yes, sir. Yes. 


13. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
RUBIO: On a number of occasions here, you bring up — let's talk about the general Russia investigation, OK? Page 6 of your testimony you say, the first thing you say is, he asked what we could do to, quote, unquote, lift the cloud, the general Russia investigation, you responded, we are investigating the matter as quickly as we could and there would be great benefit if we didn't find anything for having done the work well. He agreed. He emphasized the problems it was causing him. He agreed it'd be great to have an investigation, all the facts came out and we found nothing. He agreed that would be ideal, but this cloud is still messing up my ability to do the rest of my agenda. Is that an accurate assessment? 

COMEY: Yes, sir. He went farther than that. He said, and if some of my satellites did something wrong, it'd be good to find that out.

RUBIO: That is the second part. The satellites, if one of my satellites, I imagine he meant some of the people surrounding his campaign, did something wrong, it'd be great to know that, as well.

COMEY: Yes, sir. That's what he said.

RUBIO: Are those the only two instances in which that back and forth happened, where the president was basically saying, and I'm paraphrasing here, it's okay. Do the Russia investigation. I hope it all comes out. I have nothing to do with anything Russia. It'd be great if it all came out, people around me were doing things that were wrong?

COMEY: Yes. As I recorded it accurately there. That was the sentiment he was expressing. Yes, sir. 


14. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
RUBIO: On March 30th during the phone call about general Flynn, you said he abruptly shifted and brought up something that you call, quote, unquote, the McCabe thing. Specifically, the Mccabe thing as you understood it was that Mccabe's wife had received campaign money from what I assume means Terry McAuliffe?

COMEY: Yes.

RUBIO: Close to the Clintons. Did he say, I don't like this guy because he got money from someone close to Clinton?

COMEY: He asked me about McCabe and said, how is he going to be with me as president? I was rough on him on the campaign trail.

RUBIO: Rough on Mccabe?

COMEY: By his own account, he said he was rough on McCabe and Mrs. McCabe on the campaign trail. How is he going to be? I shared with the president, Andy is a pro. No issue at all. You have to know people of the FBI. They're not — 


15. http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn’t brought up “the McCabe thing” because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe’s wife) campaign money. Although I didn’t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.


16. http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
 He finished by stressing “the cloud” that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn’t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.


17. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295  
FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general. 


18. http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, “We need to get that fact out.” (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)


19. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295    
REED: You testified that the president asked you to lift the cloud by especially making public statements dishonoring him and perhaps others, and you refused, correct?

COMEY: I didn't do it. I didn't refuse the president. I told him we would see what we can do. The second time he called. I told him in substance, that's something your lawyer will have to take up with the Justice Department.

REED: And part of the underlying logic as we discussed many times throughout this morning is the duty to correct. That is one of a theoretical issue but also a very practical issue. Was there — your feeling that the direction on the investigation could in fact include the president?

COMEY: Well, in theory. I mean, as I explained, the concern of one of my senior leader colleagues was, if you're looking at potential coordination between the campaign and Russia, the person at the head of the campaign is the candidate. So, logically, this person argued the candidate's knowledge, understanding, would logically become a part of your inquiry if it proceeds. So, I understand that argument. But my view was that what I said to the president was accurate and fair. And fair to him. I resisted the idea of publicly saying it. Although if the Justice Department had wanted to I would have done it because of the duty to correct and the slippery slope problem. 


20. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
He, quote, described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability, end quote, as president, and asked you, quote, to lift the cloud, end quote. How did you interpret that? What did you believe he wanted you to do?

COMEY: I interpreted that as he was frustrated that the Russia investigation was taking up so much time and energy. I think he meant of the executive branch, but in the public square in general. It was making it difficult for him to focus on other priorities of his. But what he asked me was actually narrowing than that. I think what he meant by the cloud — and, again, I could be wrong — but the entire investigation is taking up oxygen and making it hard for me to focus on what I want to focus on. The ask was to get it out that I, the president, am not personally under investigation. 


21. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
FEINSTEIN: After April 11th, did he ask you more ever about the Russia investigation? Did he ask you any questions?

COMEY: We never spoke again after April 11th.

FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general. 

FEINSTEIN: So I want to go into that. Who did you talk with about that, lifting the cloud, stop the investigation back at the FBI, and what was their response?

COMEY: The FBI, during one of the two conversations — I'm not remembering exactly — I think the first, my chief of staff was sitting in front of me and heard my end of the conversation because the president's call was a surprise. I discussed the lifting the cloud and the request with the senior leadership team who, typically, and I think in all the circumstances, was the deputy director, my chief of staff, the general counsel, the deputy director's chief counsel and, I think in a number of circumstances, the number three in the FBI and a few of the conversations included the head of the national security branch. The group of us that lead the FBI when it comes to national security.

FEINSTEIN: You have the president of the United States asking you to stop an investigation that is an important investigation. What was the response of your colleagues?

COMEY: I think they were as shocked and troubled by it as I was. Some said things that led me to believe that. I don't remember exactly. But the reaction was similar to mine. They're all experienced people who never experienced such a thing, so they were very concerned. Then the conversation turned to about, so what should we do with this information? That was a struggle for us. Because we are the leaders of the FBI, so it's been reported to us, and I heard it and now shared it with the leaders of the FBI, our conversation was, should we share this with any senior officials at the justice department? Our primary concern was, we can't infect the investigative team. We don't want the agents and analysts working on this to know the president of the united States has asked, and when it comes from the president, I took it as a direction, to get rid of this investigation because we're not going to follow that request. So we decided, we have to keep it away from our troops.

Is there anyone else we ought to tell at the justice department? We considered whether to tell -- the attorney general said we believe rightly he was shortly going to recuse. There was no other senate confirmed leaders in the justice department at that point. The deputy attorney general was Mr. Boente, acting shortly in the seat. We decided the best move would be to hold it, keep it in a box, document it, as we'd already done, and this investigation is going to do on. Figure out what to do with it down the road. Is there a way to corroborate it? It was our word against the president's. No way to corroborate this. My view of this changed when the prospect of tapes was raised. That's how we thought about it then. 


22. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
COLLINS: There was the March 30th phone call with the president in which you reminded him that congressional leaders had been briefed that we were no personally — the FBI was not personally investigating president trump. And, again, was that statement to congressional leaders and to the president limited to counterintelligence investigations, or was it a broader statement? I'm trying to understand whether there was any kind of investigation of the president underway.

COMEY: No. I'm sorry. If I misunderstood, I apologize. We briefed the congressional leadership about what Americans we had opened counterintelligence investigation cases on. We specifically said, the president is not one of those Americans. But there was no other investigation of the president that we were not mentioning at that time. The context was, counterintelligence, but I wasn't trying to hide some criminal investigation of the president. 


23. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295   
BLUNT: Six weeks later were still telling the president on March the 30th that he was not personally the target of any investigation?

COMEY: Correct. On March the 30th, and I think again on April 11th, as well, I told him we're not investigating him personally. That was true. 


24. http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I “get out” that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that “the cloud” was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.


25. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295 
McCAIN: So both President Trump and former candidate Clinton are both involved in the investigation, yet one of them, you said, there's going to be no charges. And the other one, the investigation continues. Well, I think there's a double standard there to tell you the truth. Then when the president said to you, he talked about the April 11th phone call, he said, quote, because I've been very loyal to you. Very loyal. We had that thing, you know. Does that arouse your curiosity as to what quote that thing was?

COMEY: Yes.

McCAIN: Why didn't you ask him?

COMEY: It didn't seem to me to be important for the conversation we were having to understand that I took it to be some — an effort to communicate to me this — that there is a relationship between us where I've been good to you, you should be good to me. 


26. http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
He said he would do that and added, “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.” I did not reply or ask him what he meant by “that thing.” I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.


27. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
LANKFORD: OK. You had mentioned before about some news stories and news accounts. Without having to go into all of the names and specific times and to be able to dip into all of that. Have there been news accounts about the Russian investigation or collusion about the whole event or as you read the story you were wrong about how wrong they got the facts?

COMEY: Yes, there have been many, many stories based on — well, lots of stuff but about Russia that are dead wrong. 


28. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
COTTON: On February 14th the New York Times published the story, the headline of which was “Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence.” You were asked if that as an inaccurate story. Would it be fair to characterize that story as almost entirely wrong?

COMEY: Yes. 


29. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
RISCH: I remember, you talked with us shortly after February 14th, when the "New York Times" wrote an article that suggested that the trump campaign was colluding with the Russians. Do you remember reading that article when it first came out?

COMEY: I do, it was about allegedly extensive electronic surveillance in their communications.

RISCH: Correct. That upset you to the point where you surveyed the intelligence community to see whether you were missing something in that. Is that correct?

COMEY: That's correct. I want to be careful in open setting, but —

RISCH: I'm not going to go any further than that, so thank you. In addition to that, after that, you sought out both Republican and Democrat senators to tell them that, hey, I don't know where this is coming from, but this is not the case. This is not factual. Do you recall that?

COMEY: Yes.

RISCH: Okay. So again, so the American people can understand this, that report by the New York Times was not true. Is that a fair statement?

COMEY: In the main, it was not true. And again, all of you know this. Maybe the American people don't. The challenge, and I'm not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information, is the people talking about it often don't really know what's going on, and going on are not talking about it. We don't call the press to say, hey, you don't that thing wrong about the sensitive topic. We have to leave it there. 


30. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
 KING: In his press conference May 18th, the president responded, quote, no, no, when asked about asking you to stop the investigation into general Flynn. Is that a true statement?

COMEY: I don't believe it is. 


31. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
RUBIO: And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia investigation, he was asking specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself?

COMEY: That's how I understood it. Yes, sir.

RUBIO: As you perceived it, while he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given the setting, the position and some of the circumstances?

COMEY: Yes. 


32. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
  KING: All right. We'll be having a closed session shortly so we'll follow up on that. In terms of his comments to you about — I think in response to Senator Risch, he said, I hope you'll hold back on that, but when you get a — when a president of the United States in the Oval Office says something like, I hope or I suggest or would you, do you take that as a directive?

COMEY: Yes. It rings in my ear as, well, will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest.

KING: I was just going to quote that, in 1179, December 27th, Henry II said, who will rid me of the meddlesome priest, and the next day, he was killed. Exactly the same situation. We're thinking along the same lines.


33. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
WYDEN: Your testimony was that the president's request about Flynn could infect investigation. Had the president got what he wanted and what he asked of you, what would have been the effect on the investigation?

COMEY: We would have closed any investigation of general Flynn in connection with his statements and encounters -- statements about encounters with Russians in the late part of December. We would have dropped an open criminal investigation. 


34. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
 KING: Back to Mr. Flynn. Would the — would closing out the Flynn investigation have impeded the overall Russian investigation?

COMEY: No. Well, unlikely, except to the extent — there is always a possibility if you have a criminal case against someone and squeeze them, flip them and they give you information about something else. But I saw the two as touching each other but separate. 


35. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
KING: With regard to the — several of these conversations, in his interview with Lester Holt on NBC, the president said, I had dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. Is this an accurate statement?

COMEY: No, sir.

KING: Did you in any way initiate that dinner?

COMEY: No. 


36. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
  WARNER: Let me move to the January 27th dinner, where you said "The president began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI director.”

He also indicated that “lots of people" again your words, "Wanted the job." You go on to say the dinner itself was "Seemingly an effort to" to quote have you ask him for your job and create some "patronage" relationship. The president seems from my reading of your memo to be holding your job or your possibility of continuing your job over your head in a fairly direct way. What was your impression, and what did you mean by this notion of a patronage relationship?

COMEY: Well, my impression, and again it's my impression, I could always be wrong but my common sense told me what was going on is, either he had concluded or someone had told him that you didn't, you've already asked Comey to stay, and you didn't get anything for it. And that the dinner was an effort to build a relationship, in fact, he asked specifically, of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay. As I said, what was odd about that is we'd already talked twice about it by that point and he said I very much hope you'll stay. In fact, I just remembered sitting a third, when you've seen the. IC tour of me walking across the blue room, and what the president whispered in my ear was "I really look forward to working with you." So after those encounters —

WARNER: That was a few days before your firing.

COMEY: On the Sunday after the inauguration. The next Friday I have dinner and the president begins by wanting to talk about my job and so I'm sitting there thinking wait a minute three times we've already, you've already asked me to stay or talked about me staying. My common sense, again I could be wrong but my common sense told me what's going on here is, he's looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job. 


37. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
RUBIO: What it comes down to is the president asked three things of you. Asked for your loyalty. You said you'd be loyally honest.

COMEY: Honestly loyal. 


38. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
REED: Now, again, also, you've testified that the president asked you repeatedly to be loyal to him. And you responded you'd be honestly loyal. Which is your way of saying I'll be honest and I'll be ahead of the FBI independent, is that fair?

COMEY: Correct. I tried honest first. And also, you see it in my testimony. I also tried to explain to him why it's in his interest and every president's interest for the FBI to be apart, in a way, because it's credibility is important to a president and total country. And so, I tried to hold the line. Hold the line. It got very awkward. And then I said you'll always have honesty from me. He said honest loyalty. And I then I proceeded with that as I saw that as a way to add this awkwardness. 

39. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
COLLINS: Then on the January 27th dinner, you told the president that he should be careful about asking you to investigate because, “you might create a narrative that we are investigating him personally, which we weren't.” Again, were you limiting that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or more broadly, such as a criminal investigation?

COMEY: I didn't modify the word investigation. It was, again, he was reacting strongly against the unverified material, saying I'm tempted to order you to investigate it. In the context of that, I said, sir, be careful about it. I might create a narrative we're investigating you personally. 


40. http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
HEINRICH: As you're very aware, it was only the two of you in the room for that dinner. You told us the president asked you to back off the Flynn investigation. The president told a reporter —

COMEY: Not in that dinner. 



First, what they agree on: both agree the Jan 6th, Jan 27th, Feb 14th, March 30th, and April 11th conversations occurred. Both agree that that a lot of the press reports about Russian collusion get the facts wrong. Both agree that, at least at one point, Trump expressed that he wanted the Russia investigation to be done well. Both agree that Comey told Trump he was not under investigation at least three times, although Comey mentions telling Trump he's not under investigation on Jan 6 and Trump does not.

Besides Comey's view of his conversations with Trump, neither are aware of any other attempt to impede the investigation, and this is backed up by other statements and testimonies:


http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531897778/intelligence-leaders-testify-before-senate-panel-hearing
	DAN COATS: I have never been pressured. I have never felt pressure to intervene or interfere in any way with shaping intelligence in a political way or in relationship to an ongoing investigation.

	...BLUNT: And you would characterize your quote as no effort to impede the Russian investigation as still accurate?

	McCABE: That’s correct.

	...RUBIO: The question is, are you aware of any efforts by anyone in the White House or the executive branch looking for advice from other members of the intelligence community about how to potentially influence an investigation?.

	ROGERS: Are you talking about me? No.

	COATS: No.

	McCABE: I'm not sure I understand the question, but if you're asking whether we—I’m aware of requests to other people in the intelligence community, I am not.

	RUBIO: Seeking advice on how it could potentially influence someone, you're not aware of anyone ever saying or reporting that to you?

	McCABE: No, sir.


With Adam Entous being the odd man out:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/top-intelligence-official-told-associates-trump-asked-him-if-he-could-intervene-with-comey-to-get-fbi-to-back-off-flynn/2017/06/06/cc879f14-4ace-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html
 	Top intelligence official told associates Trump asked him if he could intervene with Comey on FBI Russia probe 

	By Adam Entous June 6

	The nation’s top intelligence official told associates in March that President Trump asked him if he could intervene with then-FBI Director James B. Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe, according to officials.

	On March 22, less than a week after being confirmed by the Senate, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats attended a briefing at the White House together with officials from several government agencies. As the briefing was wrapping up, Trump asked everyone to leave the room except for Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.

	The president then started complaining about the FBI investigation and Comey’s handling of it, said officials familiar with the account Coats gave to associates. Two days earlier, Comey had confirmed in a congressional hearing that the bureau was probing whether Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 race.

	After the encounter, Coats discussed the conversation with other officials and decided that intervening with Comey as Trump had suggested would be inappropriate, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters.


And Pompeo, as far as I can tell, so far remaining silent.


Amusingly, both agree that Comey is cowardly:


https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/873879934040780801
	I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

	COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly

	...FEINSTEIN: Now, here's the question, you're big. You're strong. I know the oval office, and I know what happens to people when they walk in. There is a certain amount of intimidation. But why didn't you stop and say, Mr. President, this is wrong. I cannot discuss this with you.

	COMEY: It's a great question. Maybe if I were stronger, I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took in. The only thing I could think to say, because I was playing in my mind -- because I could remember every word he said -- I was playing in my mind, what should my response be? That's why I carefully chose the words. Look, I've seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes. I remember saying, “I agree he is a good guy,” as a way of saying, I'm not agreeing with what you asked me to do. Again, maybe other people would be stronger in that circumstance. That's how Ed myself. I hope I'll never have another opportunity. Maybe if I did it again, I'd do it better. 

	...COMEY: ...I don't know. I think — as I said earlier, I think the circumstances were such that it was — I was a bit stunned and didn't have the presence of mind. I don't know. I don't want to make you sound like I'm captain courageous.


While they might be right with on that point, overall neither of their stories completely hold up.

Trump says Rosenstein wrote his memo on Comey because of Comey's poor performance in Congressional hearings, and Trump describes his reason to fire Comey as "accepting the recommendation" of Rosenstein and Sessions. But Trump was planning to fire Comey before that, and Trump asked Rosenstein for the memo:


http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/read-rosensteins-full-opening-statement-comey-congress/
	On May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader.

	I wrote a brief memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my longstanding concerns about Director Comey’s public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation.

	I chose the issues to include in my memorandum. 

	...I sent my signed memorandum to the Attorney General after noon on Tuesday, May 9.


It looks like Trump was trying to hide his reasons for firing Comey.

Trump claims he "cherishes" the FBI, but it looks like Trump only likes the FBI when he thinks they're doing him favors:

	Donald Trump on Sunday said Hillary Clinton was "being protected by a rigged system," hours after the FBI once again cleared her in its investigation into her use of a private email server.


Trump claims there is no collusion between his campaign and the Russians, but one of his foreign policy advisors had been recruited as a Russian agent, and his National Security Advisor made a deal with the Russians to hold off on retaliation against U.S. sanctions for election meddling. Trump's campaign has gone out of their way to aide the Russians in wars against our allies, something Trump said he'd "look into:"


http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-vice-president-joe-biden/story?id=41020870
	 TRUMP: I'm not going to be mean to anybody. George, you know me pretty well. I don't bow, OK. I don't bow.

	But if we can have a good relationship with Russia and if Russia would help us get rid of ISIS, frankly, as far as I'm concerned, you're talking about tremendous amounts of money and lives and everything else, that would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.

	STEPHANOPOULOS: Even if that means conditioning our commitments to NATO, as you said?

	TRUMP: No, because you're not going to do that. NATO is going to be just fine. But NATO countries -- we have 28 countries -- many of them are taking advantage of us because they're not paying. So we're protecting these countries and they're not paying.

	And when people leave that last part in, everybody agrees with me.

	I'm all in favor of NATO. I said NATO is obsolete...

	STEPHANOPOULOS: Then why did you soften the GOP platform on Ukraine?

	TRUMP: I wasn't involved in that. Honestly, I was not involved.

	STEPHANOPOULOS: Your people were.

	TRUMP: Yes. I was not involved in that. I'd like to -- I'd have to take a look at it. But I was not involved in that. 


But there is no indication Trump has ever "looked into that." So how is he sure there is no collusion? Clearly, the FBI is not sure of that.

Trump said he has nothing to do with Russia except the Miss Universe pageant and selling a house to a wealthy Russian. But that's not what he's said before:


https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-21/trump-russia-and-those-shadowy-sater-deals-at-bayrock
	"It's ridiculous that I wouldn't be investing in Russia," Trump said in that deposition. "Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment."

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-trump-political-conflict-zone/story?id=42263092
 	Long before he ran for president, Trump displayed an ongoing interest in Russia and the former Soviet states. He negotiated projects in the Republic of Georgia and Azerbaijan, neither of which was completed. And he and his children at different times toured Moscow in search of a site for a Trump project there. 

 	...Trump was involved in a range of deals with Russian-born business executives, including the developer of the Trump project in Toronto. One of his partners in Trump Soho recruited financing from investors in Russia and Kazakhstan, according to court filings. And in 2013, Trump earned a cut of the proceeds when a Russian oligarch paid to host the Miss Universe Pageant at his venue in Moscow. 

	At the same time, wealthy Russians accounted for significant profits at Trump projects in the U.S.. Throughout the 2000s, records show Russians were buying into Trump branded real estate. 

	...There is ample evidence in Russian media from that period in the 2000s that brokers mounted a significant effort to attract buyers to Trump properties in Florida, Toronto and New York. And Trump and his children participated in those campaigns.
     
	During the marketing of the Trump SoHo project, in which Trump licensed his name to a group that included Russian investors, the Trump family met with a group of Russian journalists at their New York offices to help boost interest in the project, according to Russian media reports. During the meeting, Trump was quoted telling the gathering of Russian journalists: “I really like Vladimir Putin. I respect him. He does his work well. Much better than our Bush.”


Trump claims Yates didn't make her warning about Flynn sound urgent in her conversations with McGahn or her testimony, but Yates testified that the situation was a matter of urgency:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/
	YATES: ...The first meeting occurred on January 26, called Don McGahn first thing that morning and told him that I had a very sensitive matter that I needed to discuss with him, that I couldn't talk about it on the phone and that I needed to come see him.

	...We also told the White House Counsel that General Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI on February 24. Mr. McGahn asked me how he did and I declined to give him an answer to that.

	...not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information.

	And that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Finally, we told them that we were giving them all of this information so that they could take action, the action that they deemed appropriate.

	I remember that Mr. McGahn asked me whether or not General Flynn should be fired

	...WHITEHOUSE: You could perhaps have waited until you actually had seen the agents 302 from the interview of General Flynn. Why go ahead of that? Why not wait?

	YATES: Well, because this was a matter of some urgency, we...

	...YATES: ...And he said that they were concerned that taking action might interfere with the FBI investigation. And we told him, both the senior career official and I, that he should not be concerned with it, that General Flynn had been interviewed, that their action would not interfere with any investigation and in fact, I remember specifically saying, you know it wouldn't really be fair of us to tell you this and then expect you to sit on your hands.


Trump claims it is unfair to fire Flynn after "hearing from somebody we don't even know" (the acting Attorney General), but appears to think its fair to fire somebody after "illegal" and "unfair" leaks to the "witch hunting" media.

Trump, contradicting Comey's sworn testimony, claims he never asked Comey for "loyalty." But Trump asks everybody for loyalty:


https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/style/hope-hicks-donald-trump.html
	Ms. Hicks, who has recently been featured in Marie Claire and GQ, remains loyal, apparently unperturbed by the controversies swirling around her candidate and prepared to stick it out.

	Mr. Trump, asked if Ms. Hicks would have a spot in his administration, replied, “She would definitely have a role.”

	...Or, as Ivanka Trump said in an interview: “My father makes people earn his trust. She’s earned his trust.”

 	Trump Denies Seeking Comey 'Loyalty,' Dodges Tapes Question 

	June 10, 2017, at 2:26 a.m.

	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says he's willing to testify under oath about his conversations with the man he fired as FBI director.

	The pledge came as Trump accused James Comey of lying to Congress about their private exchanges. The president specifically denied asking Comey for his "loyalty" early in Trump's term.

	Comey testified at a Senate hearing that he made memos after speaking to Trump on several occasions because he feared the president would lie about them. He also said Trump wanted him to back off on the FBI investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

	Trump dodged questions at a news conference about whether, as he's hinted, the conversations with Comey were taped. The House intelligence committee is seeking any tapes of the conversations.

	Trump Says He Did Not Tape Comey Conversations
	By MARK LANDLER and MAGGIE HABERMAN
	JUNE 22, 2017 

	WASHINGTON — President Trump cleared up one of the capital’s least suspenseful mysteries on Thursday, acknowledging that he did not record conversations with James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in anger over an investigation into his campaign’s possible ties to Russia.

	Meeting a self-imposed deadline of this week to resolve questions he himself raised by implying that he had taped Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had not made tapes of what Mr. Comey has testified were attempts by the president to derail the Justice Department’s investigation.

	...Mr. Trump’s original tweet appeared to refer to an article in The New York Times that reported that he had asked Mr. Comey to pledge loyalty during a dinner at the White House shortly after the inauguration.


Trump came out swinging with threats he could blackmail Comey with the tapes. But after he denied asking for Comey's loyalty in an interview with Jeanine Pirro, Trump didn't sound so confident. It sounds like Trump was lying about the loyalty question.


Trump claims his meeting with Lavrov was "very public," but he announced it with less than 24 hours warning and barred the U.S. press from attending:


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/trump-russia-meeting-american-reporters-blocked.html
	Trump Bars U.S. Press, but Not Russia’s, at Meeting With Russian Officials

	 When President Trump met with top Russian officials in the Oval Office on Wednesday, White House officials barred reporters from witnessing the moment. They apparently preferred to block coverage of the awkwardly timed visit as questions swirled about whether the president had dismissed his F.B.I. director in part to squelch the investigation into possible ties between his campaign and Moscow.

	...Within minutes of the meeting, the Foreign Ministry had posted photographs on Twitter of Mr. Trump and Mr. Lavrov smiling and shaking hands.

	...The White House released nothing.

	...Mr. Trump’s session with Mr. Lavrov was listed on his schedule as “Closed Press,” meaning the news media would not have a chance to photograph or otherwise document the meeting. 

	...reporters thought that White House officials might have reconsidered and decided to allow a glimpse of Mr. Trump’s meeting with the Russians after all. But instead, they were allowed into the Oval Office for a few moments to cover another, previously undisclosed meeting: between Mr. Trump and Henry Kissinger, the Nixon administration’s secretary of state.


Trump had scheduled the meeting more than a week earlier at Putin's request.


Comey's story doesn't completely hold up either.

Comey claims that "the administration" were the ones who defamed him, and that charges that the FBI was in disarray, was poorly led, and had lost confidence in Comey are lies. But this is hard to believe given the facts of Comey's handling of the email case, and contradicts numerous other public statements and reporting:


https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/fbi-in-internal-feud-over-clinton-probe/ar-AAjCtQu
	The new investigative effort, disclosed by FBI Director James Comey on Friday, shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign. Even as the probe of Mrs. Clinton’s email use wound down in July, internal disagreements within the bureau and the Justice Department surrounding the Clintons’ family philanthropy heated up, according to people familiar with the matter.

	...The back-and-forth reflects how the bureau is probing several matters related, directly or indirectly, to Mrs. Clinton and her inner circle.

	...Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said.

	...Others further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: “Stand down.” 

	...For agents who already felt uneasy about FBI leadership’s handling of the Clinton Foundation case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said.

	...Some FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they couldn’t “go prosecutor-shopping.”

	Not long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureau’s leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey’s disclosure to Congress and setting off the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign.

http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/02/politics/james-comey-fbi-reputation/index.html
	Turmoil in the FBI

	Washington (CNN) - Among the casualties of the 2016 presidential campaign is the mystique of the FBI.

	...The tensions have multiplied since FBI Director James Comey made an unprecedented public announcement in July that there should be no charges against Clinton or her aides following a year-long probe.

	That announcement -- without prior notice to his bosses at the Justice Department and, according to his critics, usurping the traditional role of prosecutors to review FBI recommendations in secret -- opened up sharp divides between Justice and FBI officials

	...Soon after the FBI opened its investigation into the Clinton server in the summer of 2015, Comey decided it would be run from headquarters instead of New York, which is the jurisdiction where the Clinton server had been located.

	That decision angered some in New York who thought it was headquarters' interference into their case.

	...That didn't quiet all of the complaints, particularly now that the behind-the-scenes tussles are spilling out into the public.

	During the Clinton email server investigation, investigators and prosecutors debated whether to issue subpoenas to Clinton's aides, officials say. Leaders at the FBI and at the Justice Department thought it would be faster 

	...In July, Comey made his announcement to recommend no charges against Clinton.

	At a Capitol Hill hearing days later, Comey told members of Congress that he was proud there had been no leaks of his decision.

	But blowback from some current and former agents was immediate. As Comey made his rounds of visits to field offices around the country, he heard stinging criticism, particularly from retired agents.

	At one meeting in Kansas City, Comey was confronted with stinging criticism of the probe. He pushed back, saying the career agents who knew the most of the case arrived at the conclusion that the case against Clinton wasn't even a close call.

	FBI agents again pressed to take more overt steps in the Clinton Foundation probe, including possibly issuing subpoenas.

	...Officials at FBI headquarters decided the Clinton Foundation probe should be consolidated in New York. They ordered that agents in Los Angeles, Little Rock and Washington, D.C., turn over their files to the FBI New York office, which appeared to have the strongest case to make.

	Agents were told to continue their work. But the order to the other field offices angered agents there.

	...How will controversy shape the bureau?

	Decades after the death of J. Edgar Hoover, who built the mystique of FBI agents as a special class of investigators, the bureau continues to nurture that image. The bureau lends its help to Hollywood, which churns out movies and television shows glamorizing the work of FBI agents.

	...How much the recent controversy changes the FBI is to be seen.

	James V. DeSarno, who spent 28 years in the bureau and rose to the level of assistant director, agrees that Comey's July announcement and Friday letter were unprecedented. But he says it doesn't signal how the FBI will run cases.

	"I don't think he believes he's changed the rules," DeSarno said of Comey, "But I can see where other people may think he has."

	...These final records — several of them in Colby’s own hand — make an unintentionally fitting conclusion to the Jewels collection, the product of a process he orchestrated as a damage control exercise but which almost proved to be the agency’s undoing.


https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-09/ap-source-abedin-didnt-send-as-many-emails-as-comey-said
	The FBI on Tuesday corrected the sworn testimony of Director James Comey, who last week told Congress that a top aide to Hillary Clinton had sent "hundreds and thousands" of emails to her husband's laptop, including some with classified information.

	In fact, the FBI said in a two-page letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, only "a small number" of the thousands of emails found on the laptop had been forwarded there while most had simply been backed up from electronic devices. Most of the email chains on the laptop containing classified information were not the result of forwarding, the FBI said.

	Comey was fired soon after the letter was made public, with the Justice Department faulting his overall conduct during the handling of the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server.


Comey said he wasn't sure at first why he was fired, but claims he later learned, after reading about Trump's conversations and watching Trump's interviews, that the President himself said Comey was fired because of the Russia investigation, saying he "takes the President at his word." Comey hints that he's referring to reports like these:

	Report: Trump Told Russians He Fired 'Nut Job' Comey Because Of Investigation
	Jessica Taylor 

	"I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job," Trump told the Russian foreign minister and U.S. ambassador on May 10 during an Oval Office meeting, according to a transcript of the meeting read to The Times by a U.S. official. "I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off."


https://www.vox.com/2017/5/11/15628276/trump-comey-fired-russia
	Trump has now admitted he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation
	by Andrew Prokop

	...But regardless of [the] recommendation, I was going to fire Comey. Knowing there was no good time to do it! 

	And in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself, I said, “You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.”


In his conversation with Lavrov, trump said firing Comey took off "great pressure because of Russia," but Trump doesn't say he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation. And Trump might been referring to leaks when he said "pressure," for example.

In the interview, Trump claims he was thinking about how the Russia investigation is an "excuse by the Democrats" when he fired Comey. Before that, he says there was no good time to fire him. It sounds like Trump was aware firing Comey in the middle of the investigation looks bad and was trying to make excuses for it. You could probably argue from this that Trump has a guilty mind about firing Comey and thinks it could have affected the investigation, but you can't say "I take trump at his word that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation," because that's not what he said.

Trump called up Comey on March 30 to ask if he could "get it out" that he wasn't under investigation, clear the name of his friends if the investigation found nothing wrong and "lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation. Leading up to the phone call, multiple media reports described the perception of Russian collusion as a "cloud" of Trump's presidency:


https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/20/fbi-bombshell-comey-trump-russia-investigation/99411214/
	Analysis: FBI bombshell creates 'a big gray cloud' over Trump's White House

	Published 3:48 p.m. ET March 20, 2017

	WASHINGTON — Not since Watergate.

	...After more than five hours of testimony, Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., closed the hearing with an almost anguished plea to Comey to finish the investigation as soon as possible. “The longer this hangs out here, the bigger the cloud is,” he said. “There is a big gray cloud that you have now put over people who have very important work to do to lead this country.”


Comey interpreted "lift the cloud" to mean "drop the Russia investigation." But it sounds like Trump was referring to the "big gray cloud" reported by the media. "Getting out" that Trump wasn't under investigation would have helped "lift" that "cloud," and that's exactly what Trump asked.

At the February 14th Oval office meeting, Trump cleared the room and told Comey "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go." Comey interpreted this as an order to drop all ongoing criminal investigations into Flynn.

But this was the day after Trump fired Flynn, and Trump expressed that he believed that the IC had it out for Flynn, and that he was forced to fire Flynn because of leaks from "Obama people" in "intelligence." Trump preceded his Flynn comments by a long rant about leaks. The leak that did Flynn in the day before revealed that the Trump administration was warned that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail, a warning that Trump had ignored for 18 days. A few days before that, there was a major leak that Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador, and another that the CIA denied a security clearance to one of Flynn's aids.

It sounds like Trump thought the IC had it out for Flynn (and himself) and was trying to plea for clemency. "I hope you can let this go" makes it sound like Trump thought Comey was angry at him. Trump would later assert that Flynn was "treated unfairly by the media."

Trump has shown an awareness that obstruction of justice is wrong in his public statements, and it is unlikely that Trump would take such a risk for Flynn. There is no basis to conclude that Trump cares about anybody other than himself. And Trump is happy to blame his problems with Flynn on Obama instead of defending him:

	General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.

	SPICER: ...His clearance was last re-issued by the Obama Administration in 2016 with full knowledge of his activities that occurred in 2015, as you point out. So the issue is, you know, he was issued a security clearance under the Obama Administration in the spring of 2016.

	HOLT: Did you know that he had had -- that received payments from the Russian government? That he had...

	TRUMP: No.

	HOLT: ...received payments from the Turkish government?

	TRUMP: No, but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration. And his -- and -- and this is something they never want to report.

	He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have. And I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.

	You know, you're talking about 2015. I don't know that I knew him in 2015.


There are compelling reasons to believe Trump suspects an investigation into Flynn could bring him down, but Comey had already told Trump that he was not under investigation 17 days earlier--after Trump learned of Flynn's legal jeopardy.

Comey says he wouldn't "go so far" as to "connect" Trump's demand for loyalty to the investigation:

	SEN. RON WYDEN: ...I believe January 27th, all in one dinner, the president raised your job prospects, he asked for your loyalty and denied allegations against him. All took place over one supper. Now, you told senator Warner that the president was looking to, quote, get something. Looking back, did that dinner suggest that your job might be contingent on how you handled the investigation?

	COMEY: I don't know that I'd go that far. I got the sense my job would be contingent upon how he felt I — excuse me — how he felt I conducted myself and whether I demonstrated loyalty. But I don't know whether I'd go so far as to connect it to the investigation. 


But the timing of the requests makes it reasonable to suspect a connection. Trump had just learned that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Flynn made major decisions during those calls, including setting up a later call between Trump and Putin, and Flynn called back four times in the same day. It's a reasonable suspicion that Trump was involved with the calls, which means the investigation into Flynn could implicate Trump.

Flynn was interviewed without a lawyer, suggesting he might not have been the target of that investigation. The White House was in a position to know this when they asked the DOJ about possible criminal proceedings a few hours before Comey's dinner. Meanwhile, Trump was preparing a "travel ban" that would give him an alibi for firing the acting Attorney General.

According to Trump's interview and media reports, it was during this dinner that Trump asked Comey if he was under investigation. But Comey had already assured Trump he wasn't under investigation earlier that month, a fact which Trump would conspicuously omit in a later interview. Clearly, something happened between January 6th and January 27th that made Trump feel the need to ask again.

But Comey says he wouldn't "go so far" as to connect Trump's demand for loyalty to any investigation.

When pressed for loyalty on Jan 27th, Comey told Trump he'd give him "honest loyalty." When Trump told Comey he hoped he could "let Flynn go," Comey didn't challenge Trump or ask for clarification. When Trump asked Comey if he could "lift the cloud" on March 30th, Comey told him he'd "see what he can do." When Trump asked Comey about this request and brought up "that thing we had" on April 11, Comey doesn't ask any questions. This is inappropriate behavior for an FBI director, but Comey's excuses are weak:

	REED: Now, again, also, you've testified that the president asked you repeatedly to be loyal to him. And you responded you'd be honestly loyal. Which is your way of saying I'll be honest and I'll be ahead of the FBI independent, is that fair?

	COMEY: Correct. I tried honest first. And also, you see it in my testimony. I also tried to explain to him why it's in his interest and every president's interest for the FBI to be apart, in a way, because it's credibility is important to a president and total country. And so, I tried to hold the line. Hold the line. It got very awkward. And then I said you'll always have honesty from me. He said honest loyalty. And I then I proceeded with that as I saw that as a way to add this awkwardness. 

	...FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

	COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general. 

	...RUBIO: His specific ask was you'd tell the American people what you'd told him, told the leaders of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, he was not personally under investigation?

	COMEY: Yes, sir.

	RUBIO: What he was asking you to do, would you have done here today?

	COMEY: Correct. Yes, sir.

	RUBIO: Again, at that setting, did you say to the president, it would be inappropriate for you to do so and then talk to the White House counsel or somebody so hopefully they'd talked to him and tell him he couldn't do this?

	COMEY: First time I said, I'll see what we can do. Second time, I explained how it should work, that the White House counsel should contact the deputy attorney general.

	RUBIO: You told him that?

	COMEY: The president said, okay. I think that's what I'll do. 

	...McCAIN: So both President Trump and former candidate Clinton are both involved in the investigation, yet one of them, you said, there's going to be no charges. And the other one, the investigation continues. Well, I think there's a double standard there to tell you the truth. Then when the president said to you, he talked about the April 11th phone call, he said, quote, because I've been very loyal to you. Very loyal. We had that thing, you know. Does that arouse your curiosity as to what quote that thing was?

	COMEY: Yes.

	McCAIN: Why didn't you ask him?

	COMEY: It didn't seem to me to be important for the conversation we were having to understand that I took it to be some — an effort to communicate to me this — that there is a relationship between us where I've been good to you, you should be good to me. 

	...RUBIO: And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia investigation, he was asking specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself?

	COMEY: That's how I understood it. Yes, sir.

	RUBIO: As you perceived it, while he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given the setting, the position and some of the circumstances?

	COMEY: Yes.

	RUBIO: At the time, did you say something to the president about, that is not an appropriate request, or did you tell the white house counsel, it's not an appropriate request? Someone needs to tell the president he can't do these things.

	COMEY: I didn't, no.

	RUBIO: Why?

	COMEY: I don't know. I think — as I said earlier, I think the circumstances were such that it was — I was a bit stunned and didn't have the presence of mind. I don't know. I don't want to make you sound like I'm captain courageous. I don't know if I would have said to the president with the presence of mind, sir, that's wrong. In the moment, it didn't come to my mind. What came to my mind is be careful what you say. I said, I agree Flynn is a good guy. 


Comey's statements to Trump and the public make it sound like he's trying to confuse people.

On March 10, 2015, Secretary Clinton made the following pubic statements about her use of a private email server for State Department business:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/

	Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that "it would have been probably smarter" to use two e-mail accounts during her time as secretary of state. Here is a complete transcript of her remarks.

	...Now, I would be pleased to talk more about this important matter, but I know there have been questions about my email, so I want to address that directly, and then I will take a few questions from you.

	There are four things I want the public to know.

	First, when I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.

	Looking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue.

	Second, the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.

	Third, after I left office, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work- related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totalled roughly 55,000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them. We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work- related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.

	No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.

	Fourth, I took the unprecedented step of asking that the State Department make all my work-related emails public for everyone to see.

	I am very proud of the work that I and my colleagues and our public servants at the department did during my four years as secretary of state, and I look forward to people being able to see that for themselves.

	Again, looking back, it would've been better for me to use two separate phones and two email accounts. I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously, it hasn't worked out that way.


And also:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/
	...I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.


As it turns out, Clinton's statements were less than truthful. Lying to the public isn't illegal, but a person's lies can be used in court to show intent or guilt. When Comey declined to indict Clinton and later testified about his decision, he did a pretty bad job of taking that into account. Related to this, Comey also made some unusual decisions and statements about the case, which are illuminating as to his character and possible intentions. It's worth looking at in detail.


Claim #1: Clinton never sent or received anything classified:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/
	 March 10, 2015

	QUESTION: Were you ever -- were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using -- using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president?

	CLINTON: I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.

	So I'm certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.

	Inquiry Sought in Hillary Clinton’s Use of Email

	JULY 23, 2015

	Two inspectors general have asked the Justice Department to open an investigation into whether sensitive government information was mishandled in connection with the personal email account Hillary Rodham Clinton used as secretary of state, senior government officials said Thursday.

	The request follows an assessment in a June 29 memo by the inspectors general for the State Department and the intelligence agencies that Mrs. Clinton’s private account contained “hundreds of potentially classified emails.”

	Clinton: Email classification changes 'nothing'
	01/20/2016 

	Hillary Clinton’s “top secret” email classification changes “nothing,” the former secretary of state said Wednesday.

	“I'm just going to leave it up to the professionals at the Justice Department, because nothing that this says changes the fact that I never sent or received material marked classified”


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/transcript-clinton-testifies-before-house-committee-on-benghazi/
	JORDAN: And that first statement in March was not accurate. In March, you said no classified information was sent or received on your personal accounts. You later revised your statement and said no information marked classified was sent or received on your personal account.

	And once again, your revised statement was after the inspector general for the intelligence community had examined your e-mails and determined that, yes, some indeed were classified.

	CLINTON: There was nothing marked classified on my e-mails, either sent or received. And I want to respond...

	JORDAN: You used the write term there. Used "marked". That's the one -- that's what you -- you used the revised statement there.

	CLINTON: ...well -- but that's -- well, Congressman, there was a lot of confusion because many -- many Americans have no idea how the classification process works.

	DESANTIS: And of that top secret information you found, would somebody who is sophisticated in those matters, should it have been obvious to them that was sensitive information?

	COMEY: Yes.

	DESANTIS: So I guess my issue about knowledge of what you’re doing is, in order for Secretary Clinton to have access to top secret, SCI FBI information, didn’t she have to sign a form with the State Department acknowledging her duties and responsibilities under the law to safeguard this information?

	COMEY: Yes. Anybody who gets access to SCI, Sensitive Compartmented Information would sign a read-in form that lays that out. I’m sure members of Congress have seen the same thing.

	DESANTIS: And it stresses in that document and other training people would get, that there are certain requirements to handling certain levels of information. For example, a top secret document, that can’t even be on your secret system at the FBI, correct?

	COMEY: Correct.

	DESANTIS: So you have to follow certain guidelines. And I guess my question is, is she’s very sophisticated person, she did execute that document, correct?

	COMEY: Yes.


http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/10/22/hillary-clinton-appears-lecture-state-department-colleagues-cyber-security-email-server
	A new video has surfaced that appears to show then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recording a video warning her colleagues about the dangers of insufficient cyber security.

	"Protecting our cyber infrastructure and digital networks has to be a matter of national security," Clinton says in the video.

	"I think this is a responsibility we all share as Americans, but as state department employees, we have a special duty to guard ourselves and our sensitive information."


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/transcript-clinton-testifies-before-house-committee-on-benghazi/
	CLINTON: ...And therefore I wanted to make it clear that there is a system within our government, certainly within the State Department...

	JORDAN: (inaudible) one more question (inaudible).

	CLINTON: ...where material that is thought to be classified is marked such, so that people have the opportunity to know how they are supposed to be handling those materials...

	
https://fam.state.gov/fam/05fam/05fam0480.html
	Each portion of a document containing classified information, ordinarily a paragraph but including the subject line, headers, summaries, tables or graphics, must be marked to indicate its classification level, or that it is unclassified, by placing one of the parenthetical symbols listed below immediately preceding the portion to which it applies.  Subject line and header portion markings may appear after the text.

	MARKING SYMBOLS
	(TS) = Top Secret       (S) = Secret
	(C) = Confidential     (SBU) = Sensitive But Unclassified     (U) = Unclassified

	...Information marked with a classification level under this or predecessor orders should be considered classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/transcript-clinton-testifies-before-house-committee-on-benghazi/
	JORDAN: I got -- I got one second.

	CLINTON: ...and that's why it became clearer, I believe, to say that nothing was marked classified at the time I sent or received it.

	After reviewing an email dated April 9, 2012, with subject line "Call to President Banda," CLINTON stated she did not remember the email specifically. When asked what the parenthetical "C" meant before a paragraph within the captioned email, CLINTON stated she did not know and could only speculate it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical documents.

	MEADOWS: So a reasonable person who has been a Senator, a Secretary of State, a First Lady, wouldn’t a reasonable person know that that was a classified marking? As a secretary of state, a reasonable person? That’s all I’m asking.

	COMEY: Before this investigation, I probably would have said, yes. I’m not so sure. I don’t find it incredibly…

	MEADOWS: Director Comey, come on.

	I mean, I have only been here a few years and I understand the importance of those markings. So you’re suggesting that a long length of time that she had no idea what a classified marking would be? That’s your sworn testimony today?

	COMEY: No, no, not that she would have no idea what a classified marking would be, but it’s an interesting question as to — the question about sophistication came up earlier — whether she was sophisticated enough to understand what a “c” means.

	MEADOWS: So you’re saying the former Secretary of State is not sophisticated enough to understand a classified marking?

	COMEY: That’s not what I said.

	MEADOWS: That’s a huge statement.

	COMEY: That’s not what I said. You asked me did I assume someone would know. Probably before the investigation, I would have, I’m not so sure of that answer any longer. I think it’s possible — possible that she didn’t understand what a “c” meant when she saw it in the body of the e-mail like that.

	MEADOWS: After years in the Senate and Secretary of State, I mean, that’s hard for me and the American people to believe, Director Comey. And I’m not questioning your analysis of it, but wouldn’t a reasonable person think that someone who has the highest job of handling classified information would understand that?

	COMEY: I think that’s the conclusion a reasonable person would draw. It may not be accurate…

	BUCK: And there is no doubt about those two elements. Now I don’t know whether the next element is one element or two, but it talks about knowingly removed such materials without authority and with the intent to retain such material at an unauthorized location.

	So I’m going to treat those as two separate parts of the intent element. First of all, do you see the word “willfully” anywhere in this statute?

	COMEY: I don’t.

	BUCK: And that would indicate to you that there is a lower threshold for intent?

	COMEY: No, it wouldn’t.

	BUCK: Why?

	COMEY: Because we often — as I understand, the Justice Department’s practice and judicial practice will impute to any criminal statute at that level with a knowingly also requirement that you know that you’re involved in criminal activity of some sort. A general mens rea requirement.

	BROOKS: ...so then when your compound took a second attack on June 6th, when a bomb blew a wall through the compound then, no e-mails, no e-mails at all. But I am interested in knowing who were you meeting with, who were you huddling with, how were you informed about those things? Because there is nothing in the e-mails that talks about two significant attacks on our compounds in 2012. There was a lot of information in 2011 about issues and security posture and yet nothing in 2012.

	CLINTON: Well, I'd be happy to explain. Every morning when I arrived at the State Department, usually between 8:00 and 8:30, I had a personal one-on-one briefing from the representative of the Central Intelligence Agency who shared with me the highest level of classified information that I was to be aware of on a daily basis.

	...During the day, I received hundreds of pages of memos, many of them classified, some of them so top secret they were brought into my office in a locked briefcase that I had to read and immediately return to the courier.

	CHAFFETZ: So Hillary Clinton sends to Jake Sullivan, Jake — well let me go back, Jake Sullivan says they say they had issues sending secure fax, they’re working on it. Hillary Clinton sends to Jake Sullivan, if they can’t, turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send non-secure. So you’re telling me it’s a classified piece of information, she’s taking off the header and she’s instructing them to send it in a non-secure format. Is that not intent?

	COMEY: Well that actually caught my attention when I first saw it and what she explained to us in her interview was, and other witnesses too as well, is what she meant by that is make it into a non-classified document, that’s what a non-paper is in their world, and send it to us because I don’t need the classified stuff I just need the…

	CHAFFETZ: Then why take off the heading if it’s going to be turned into a non-classified document, why take off the heading?

	COMEY: I assume because it would be non-classified anymore so you wouldn’t have a classified header on it. Because what she said during her interview…

	So let me in the last little portion of this, in your three and a half-hour interview on Saturday, did she contradict some of these public statements in private? Because you said she didn’t lie to the FBI, but it’s apparent that she lied to the American people. So did she change her statements in that sworn testimony with you last Saturday?

	DESJARLAIS: OK.

	COMEY: It’s a very long, 302. I’d have to check and then get back to you.

	DESJARLAIS: OK. And we’ll get access to that.

	Do you know if they asked her when she said that there was nothing marked classified on my e-mails sent or received?

	MULVANEY: Thank you gentleman. Director Comey, earlier today you heard a long list of statements that Ms. Clinton has made previously, both to the public and to Congress that were not factually accurate.

	I think you went down the whole long list. When she met with you folks on Saturday last week, I take it she didn’t say the same things at that interview?

	COMEY: I’m not equipped sitting here without the 302 in front of me to answer in that broad…

	MULVANEY: But it’s your — it’s your testimony…


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	...CHAFFETZ: Because she wanted to be technically correct, is that what you’re saying, that you’re…

	COMEY: No, I think what she said during the interview is I was telling him in essence, send the unclassified document, take the header off, turn it into a non-paper, which is a term I had never heard before but I’m told by people I credit that in diplomatic circles something we can pass to another government…

	CHAFFETZ: You are very generous in your accepting of that.

	GOWDY: Thank you Doctor Gosar. Director Comey, I want to go back to the issue of intent for just a second. We could disagree on whether or not it’s an element of the offense, let’s assume for the sake of argument, that you’re right and I’m wrong and that it is an element of the offense.

	Secretary Clinton said that she was, “Well aware of classification requirements”. Those are her words, not mine and not yours. So if she were, “Well aware of classification requirements”, how did that impact your analysis of her intent? Because I’ve heard you this morning, describe her as being less than sophisticated. She disagrees with that.

	COMEY: Well, I was talking about technical sophistication. The question is, I would hope everybody who works in the Government is aware of classification requirements...

	POMPEO: ...One -- you talked earlier about Mr. Katala (ph), who is sitting in a prison cell not too far from where you and I are sitting here this evening. I, too, share your view that I'm glad that we've pulled one of the terrorists who murdered -- was involved in the murder of U.S. government people on that night.

	When that attack took place, Mr. Katala (ph), according to the indictment from the Justice Department, Mr. Katala (ph) and his folks removed documents from the temporary mission facility. Were you aware of that?

	CLINTON: Yes, we later became aware that documents had been removed, but there was no classified documents at Benghazi.

	POMPEO: And how do you know that?

	CLINTON: We know it through our own investigation about what documents were at Benghazi, and there were no classified materials, to the best of our information.

	POMPEO: Yes, ma'am. Do you know if there was sensitive information?

	CLINTON: I suppose it depends on what one thinks of as sensitive information. There was information there and some of it was burnt, either wholly or partially. Some of it was looted. And some of it was recovered eventually.

	POMPEO: Madam Secretary, do you know where that material that was looted went? Do you know into whose hands it fell? And do you know the nature and contents of that material? You seem very confident it wasn't classified. I don't share your confidence. But nonetheless, do you know where that material went?

	CLINTON: I think that it -- it is very difficult to know where it ended up. But I want to just reiterate the point that I made. This was not a facility that had the capacity to handle classified material. And there was, to the best of our information, Congressman, no classified material at the Benghazi facility.

	POMPEO: Ma'am, the fact that it wasn't capable of handling classified material doesn't mean that there wasn't any classified material there. Is that correct?

	CLINTON: Well, the procedure is not to have classified material at such a facility. And again, to the best of our knowledge, there was not any there.

	POMPEO: Yes, ma'am. You're not supposed to have classified e- mail on your private server either.

	CLINTON: And I did not, Congressman.

	...CHAFFETZ: You did not look at testimony that Hillary Clinton gave in the United State Congress, both the House and the Senate.

	COMEY: To see whether it was precarious in some respect?

	CHAFFETZ: Yes.

	COMEY: No we did not.

	CHAFFETZ: Did you review and look at those transcripts as to the intent of your recommendation.

	TAPPER: The inspector general of the intelligence community said some of this stuff contained classified information when it was generated whether or not it was marked classify.

	CLINTON: Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion. The State Department does not agree with that. And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems.

	We had the unclassified systems, so anybody who was on the unclassified system with the State Department would only be able to tell if something were classified if it were marked classified. We dealt with classified information on a totally different system. Nobody had access to that from an unclassified device. So, I think a lot of this is being a public display of the very common arguments that go on between different agencies and our government. This happens every time there is a Freedom of Information Act request. If something is going to be made public that was not classified at the time, maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now it's sensitive information. That's what's going on here.

	A retired senior State Department military adviser claims that Hillary Clinton’s “sloppy communications with her senior staff” when she was secretary of state may have compromised at least two counterterrorism operations.

	...Bill Johnson, who was the State Department’s political adviser to the special operations section of the U.S. Pacific Command, or PACOM, in 2010 and 2011, says secret plans to eliminate the leader of a Filipino Islamist separatist group and intercept Chinese-made weapons components being smuggled into Iraq were repeatedly foiled.

	...“We had good intel. We knew where he was,” ... “He would be gone three hours before, sometimes as little as a half-hour before” the counterterrorism teams moved in. “We knew he was getting tipped off somehow. We just didn’t know why.”

	...As a dramatic solution, the Special Operations Command stopped giving advance warning to senior State Department officials about raids, Johnson says. Whatever the cause, the leaks stopped. In February 2012, Dr. Abu and two other senior militants were eventually killed in what was described as “a U.S.-backed airstrike.”

	HILLARY CLINTON: ...But I do think I could have and should have done a better job answering questions earlier.

	I really didn't perhaps appreciate the need to do that. What I had done was allowed, it was above board. But in retrospect, certainly, as I look back at it now, even though it was allowed, I should've used two accounts. One for personal, one for work-related emails.

	That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility. ...

	 DAVID MUIR: You have said you would apologize for the confusion but not say, "I'm sorry." But I did hear a word in there just a moment ago and I'm curious. Would you acknowledge that you made a mistake here? Because you wrote in your own memoir last year just how important using the word mistake is in politics. You, you wrote, "In our political culture, saying you made a mistake is often taken as weakness when in fact it can be a sign of strength and growth." And so as you sit here, millions watching tonight, did you make a mistake?

	HILLARY CLINTON: I did. I did. As I said, it was allowed and there was no hiding it. It was totally above board. ...But I'm sorry that it has, you know, raised all of these questions. I do take responsibility for having made what is clearly not the best decision. And I want people to know that I am trying to be as transparent as possible...



All this brings up some questions, like:


- Why did Clinton change her story from "there is no classified information" to "I never sent anything classified at the time it was sent or received" to "nothing was marked classified" after media reports on her server? She told Congress she changed her story to clear up "confusion" about "how the classification process works," but all she did is confuse the public more--classified information is classified even if it's unmarked. Americans are supposed to be able to trust their officials to recognize classified and keep it safe, and Clinton's job as an original classification authority was to recognize when information is classified and mark it if necessary. Clinton wrote several emails classified at the Special Access Program (SAP) level, which is classified that way if its release would do grave damage to national security, but she didn't mark them. Clinton confused the public in a way that makes her seem less guilty (regarding confusion, read a few articles here 
https://www.google.com/search?q=information+marked+classified+confusion&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A3%2F1%2F2015%2Ccd_max%3A11%2F8%2F2016 and you'll see what I mean).


- How is it that, after lecturing the American public on classification markings, Clinton knows what "(SBU)" means, but when the FBI asks here what but "(C)" means she tells them it's referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order? There was no "(A)" or "(B)" in the short email they showed her, and it was even marked Confidential in headers on the top and bottom. Clinton has seen emails that mix both "(SBU)" and "(C)" markings (apparently, the alphabet goes "C, SBU, SBU, SBU...") and she's written thousands of cables that use both.


- Why did Comey go along with Clinton's "(C) is just a letter in the alphabet" story? He told (or implied) to Congress he's "not sure" if Clinton knew "(C)" means "Confidential," but when the question of Clinton's sophistication came up later in his testimony, Comey said "Well, I was talking about technical sophistication," as if to change his story. Comey testified that Clinton signed-off on being briefed on the handling of classified information and "executed that document." So, is she sophisticated in handling classified information or not? Comey's testimony is unnecessarily vague.


- Clinton told the FBI she had "no reason to believe" there was classified information in her account, but earlier she asked Jake Sullivan to forward an email "if not classified or otherwise inappropriate," indicating that she had reason to believe there was classified information on her account. Was she lying to the FBI?


- Clinton asked Jake Sullivan to send her classified talking points over unsecure fax, apparently for a meeting that was starting in 8 minutes (Clinton says "I didn't get the TPs yet." Sullivan says "?!!! Checking"). The problem was Clinton told him to remove the classification headers and send nonsecure, but when confronted about it in her FBI interview gave them a red herring about "non-paper" documents at the State department. Why did Comey repeat her misleading explanation to Congress?


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	CHAFFETZ: ...How did the Department of Justice, or how did the FBI view the incident in which Hillary Clinton instructed Jake Sullivan to take the markings off of a document that was to be sent to her?

	COMEY: Yes, we looked at that pretty closely. There was some problem with their secure fax machine and there was an e-mail in which she says in substance, take the headers off of it and send it as a non- paper and as we’ve dug into that more deeply, we’ve come to learn that at least this one view of it that is reasonable, that a non-paper in State Department parlance (ph) means a document that contains things we could pass to another government. So essentially take out anything that’s classified and send it to me. 


https://fam.state.gov/fam/05fah01/05fah010610.html
	Use this section to provide instructions on any written material to be left with the host government official(s).  Such material could take the form of an aide-memoire, a letter, or a “non-paper” that provides a written version of the verbal presentation (i.e., the talking points as delivered).  Unless otherwise instructed, post should normally provide an aide-memoire or non-paper at the conclusion of a demarche.  Classified aide-memoire or non-paper must be appropriately marked


- Why did Comey remember that part of Clinton's FBI interview in detail, but was forgetful when asked to compare Clinton's public statements to her statements to the FBI? ("did she change her statements in that sworn testimony with you last Saturday? ...I haven’t gone through that to parse that…", "It’s a very long, 302. I’d have to check and then get back to you.", "COMEY: I’m not equipped sitting here without the 302 in front of me to answer in that broad…  MULVANEY: But it’s your — it’s your testimony…") He made it sound like he's her defense lawyer.


- Comey testified there was "no direct evidence of an intrusion," but the FBI's report says there "appears" to have been "a successful compromise of an e-mail account on the server." Was Comey contradicting his own FBI?


- Comey inserted an "intent" requirement (a "general mens rea requirement" as he puts it) into the law that only requires "gross negligence" to prosecute someone for mishandling classified information. Comey testified that false exculpatory statements show a guilty conscience and intent, but Clinton made several such statements to Congress and the public. She gave one to Jake Tapper in an interview ("maybe something has happened years later that there's a case and so now it's sensitive information. That's what's going on here.") and one to Pompeo in her testimony ("POMPEO: Yes, ma'am. You're not supposed to have classified e- mail on your private server either. CLINTON: And I did not, Congressman."). Her statement to Pomeo came shortly after she was informed there was classified information on her server and immediately after agreeing (if at least implicitly) that classified information should not be stored in unauthorized locations. If Clinton is sophisticated in handling classified info, as Comey seems to have testified, then she knows her statements were false. Knowledge of classified information on her server can also be inferred by some of her statements in her emails ("If not classified or otherwise inappropriate...") and her statements to the FBI ("When asked whether CLINTON believed information should be classified if it is unauthorized release would cause damage to national security, she responded, 'yes, that is the understanding.'").


Claim #2: Clinton's private server was allowed, and she set it up for "convenience:"

	...when I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.

	Looking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/
	QUESTION: And also, the president of the United States said that he was unaware that you had this unusual email arrangement. The White House counsel's office says that you never approved this arrangement through them.

	Why did you not do that? Why did you -- why have you apparently caught the White House by surprise?

	And then just one last political question, if I -- I might. Does all of this make -- affect your decision in any way on whether or not to run for president?

	CLINTON: Well, let me try to unpack your multiple questions.

	First, the laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my email for work. That is undisputed.

	Since the news of Clinton’s email came to light in 2015, she has argued that she "complied with every rule" and that the practice was "allowed." We haven’t yet put the issue on the Truth-O-Meter because there were too many unknowns.

	But the inspector general’s report has clarified some of those unknowns and demonstrated that Clinton’s exclusive use of personal email was, in fact, not allowed.

	FARENTHOLD: All right. I want to go back to the question of intent real quick, for just a second.

	I’m a recovering attorney. It’s been decades since I actually practiced law. But you kept referring to she had to know it was illegal to have the requisite criminal intent. I was always taught in law school, and I don’t know where this changed, that ignorance of the law was no excuse. If I’m driving a long at 45 miles and hour and didn’t see the 35 mile and hour speed limit, I was still intentionally speeding, even though I didn’t know it.

	Now, I might not have had the requisite criminal intent if maybe my accelerator were jammed or something like that, but even though I didn’t know the law was 35, I was driving 45, I’m going to get a ticket. And I’m probably going to be prosecuted for that.

	So, how can you say ignorance of the law is an excuse in Ms. Clinton’s case?

	COMEY: Well, the comparison to petty offenses, I don’t think is — you spoke about the question of — ignorance of the law is no excuse, but here’s the distinction. You have to have general criminal intent. You don’t need to know what particular statute you’re violating, but you must be aware of the generally wrongful nature of your conduct…

At this point, [REDACTED] asked ABEDIN if it was okay to go direct with CLINTON, and was granted the "privilege."

	INFORMATION MEMO FOR CHERYL D. MILLS--S
	FROM:	DS--Eric J. Boswell
	SUBJECT: Use of Blackberries in Mahogany Row

	We have worked closely [REDACTED] to review all options that would allow Secretary Clinton, you, and a small number of staff to use Blackberries [REDACTED]

	...Our review reaffirms our belief that the vulnerabilities and risks associated with the use of Blackberries in the Mahogany Row [REDACTED] considerably outweigh the convenience their use can add to staff that have access to the unclassified OpenNet system on their desktops.

	...We also worry about the example that using Blackberries in Mahogany row might set as we strive to promote crucial security practices and enforce important security standards among State Department staff.

	...I cannot stress too strongly, however, that any unclassified Blackberry is highly vulnerable in any setting to remotely and covertly monitoring conversations, retrieving e-mails, and exploiting calendars. I am attaching reports from DS's Office of Computer Security's Cyber Threat & Analysis Division that give further background on those risks.

	...Attachments: ..."Your Cell and Your Berry: Tools for the Enemy"

	According to a DS official, shortly after the memorandum was delivered, Secretary Clinton approached the Assistant Secretary and told him she “gets it.”

	...no cell phones are allowed inside the SCIF and DS agents, officers, and staff are required to leave their cell phones outside the door in secure lockers. CLINTON refused to abide by this security requirement and brought her cell phone, believed to be a Blackberry, inside the SCIF where a DS agent assigned to Post 1 was required to guard it. DS agents were indignant that they were required to follow security policy but CLINTON made herself exempt from the same regulations.

	WASHINGTON — Hillary Rodham Clinton was directly asked by congressional investigators in a December 2012 letter whether she had used a private email account while serving as secretary of state, according to letters obtained by The New York Times.

	But Mrs. Clinton did not reply to the letter. And when the State Department answered in March 2013, nearly two months after she left office, it ignored the question and provided no response.

	(CROSSTALK) CLINTON: I don't think -- I'd be happy to have somebody talk to you about the rules. I fully complied with every rule that I was governed by.

	[REDACTED] was previously an agent of the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS). ...[REDACTED] served briefly on former Secretary CLINTON's protective detail in 2009. From her own experience, and information obtained through [REDACTED] and other agents, [REDACTED] described a "stark difference" between RICE and CLINTON with regard to obedience to security and diplomatic protocols while CLINTON frequently and "blatantly" disregarded them. For example ...It is seen as diplomatic protocl for the Secretary of State to arrive at foreign diplomatic functions with the local ambassador; however, CLINTON refused to do so, instead choosing to be accompanied in the limousine by her Chief of Staff, HUMA ABEDIN. This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol. [REDACTED] explained that CLINTON'S protocol breaches were well known throughout Diplomatic Security and were "abundant."

	...On a trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, in early 2009, CLINTON requested to visit an area of Jakarta that presented security and safety challenges. This visit was reportedly for a photo opportunity regarding CLINTON's "clean cooking stoves" initiative. The DS advance team recommended against traveling to this area because the route could not be secured and was lined with dangerous circumstances and individuals. As such, the DS advance team recommended in writing that this excursion be stricken from the schedule but were told by DS management that it was going to happen because "she wanted it." DS agents felt this excursion into potentially hostile areas placed CLINTON, her staff, the media, and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for "her election campaign." DS agents had the perception that CLINTON was using her position as Secretary of State to campaign for President of the United States. 

	...On one occasion while traveling to Palestine, CLINTON ordered the limousine driver, believed to be [REDACTED], to open the window while in "occupied territory", referring to a dangerous area of the West Bank. [REDACTED] initially declined to respond to CLINTON's request; however, repeated demands by CLINTON forced him to open his window despite the danger to himself and the occupants.

	...Early in CLINTON's tenure as Secretary of State, she and her staff were observed removing lamps and furniture from the State Department which were transported to her residence in Washington, D.C. [REDACTED] does not know whether these items were ever returned to the government upon CLINTON's departure from the State Department.

	...[REDACTED] explained that CLINTON's treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere. Prior to CLINTON's tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State's protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of CLINTON's tenure, it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.

	FBI investigation and the State OIG report determined that State issued regular notices to staff during Clinton's tenure highlighting cybersecurity threats and advising that mobile devices must be configured to State security guidelines.

	Beginning in 2009, the Cyber Threat Analysis Division (CTAD) in DS issued regular notices...According to an article posted by CTAD, digital threats begin immediately after landing in a foreign country. A primary threat is traced to the traveler’s mobile device (BlackBerry or other smart device) which is necessarily connected to the local cellular tower. This connection gives foreign entities the opportunity to intercept voice and email transmissions immediately after the traveler arrives overseas.

	‘Convenience’

	A batch of emails released last month chronicles technical issues that Clinton and her top aides were facing with her private clintonemail.com account in late 2010. This led to communications issues between Clinton and her staff, and Clinton’s emails were being blocked by the State Department’s server. In a November 2010 email, Clinton wrote to her longtime aide, Huma Abedin: “This is not a good system.”

	Abedin responded: “We should talk about putting you on state email or releasing your email address to the department so you are not going to spam. It’s not the phone message system, it’s the device delay.”

	“Let’s get separate address or device, but I don’t want any risk of the personal being accessible,” Clinton wrote.

	This email became a recurring line of questioning in Abedin’s deposition, the transcript of which was released last week by Judicial Watch. When asked about that last response line by Clinton, Abedin explained:

	“I read that line exactly the way she wrote it, which is, let’s get a separate address. There was no resistance to getting a separate email address, as I’m reading it in this document. And not wanting her personal emails to be accessible to the public. ...”

	Abedin’s answer shows that Clinton was open to having a second device or email address — which calls into question whether the “convenience” concern was relevant or applicable after she became secretary of state. Yet Clinton did not mention these issues when she explained she chose the system out of convenience.



Comey testified that for Clinton to be guilty, she'd need to be "generally aware of the wrongful nature" of her conduct and know she was "doing something wrong:"

	Statement by FBI Director James B. Comey on the Investigation of Secretary Hillary Clinton’s Use of a Personal E-Mail System

	...Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	DUNCAN: ...Do you agree that there is a very thin line between gross negligence and extreme carelessness? And would you explain to me what you consider to be that difference?

	COMEY: Sure, judge — Congressman. As a former judge, you know there isn’t actually a great definition in the law of gross negligence. Some courts interpret it as close to willful, which means you know you’re doing something wrong.

	Others drop it lower. My term (ph) extremely careless is trying to be kind of an ordinary person. That’s a common-sense way of describing it; it sure looks real careless to me.

	The question of whether that amounts to gross negligence frankly is really not at the center of this because when I look at the history of the prosecutions and see, it’s been one case brought on a gross negligence theory.

	I know from 30 years there’s no way anybody from the Department Of Justice is bringing a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts.

	DUNCAN: You ended your statement to Congressman Cooper a while ago saying no — saying once again that no reasonable prosecutor could have brought this case, yet you also mentioned earlier today that you had seen several of your friends and other prosecutors who have said publicly, many across this country, they would have been glad to prosecute this case.

	COMEY: I smile because they’re friends and I haven’t talked to them I want to say, guys, so where were ya over the last 40 years?

	Where were these cases? They just have not been brought for reasons that I said earlier. It’s a good thing the Department Of Justice worries about prosecuting people for being careless. I don’t like it.

	As a citizen, I want people to show they knew they were breaking the law and then we’ll put you in jail.



For whatever reason, Comey keeps switching throughout his testimony between saying you have to "know you were doing something wrong" or "know you were breaking the law" to be prosecuted for gross negligence. Since the idea that you have to "know you were breaking the law" to be guilty of breaking the law is absurd (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorantia_juris_non_excusat), we'll assume Comey meant you have to "know you were doing something wrong" to break the law, e.g. "consciousness of guilt" (which is also absurd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent_homicide, but anyway...). Even still, Comey's defense of Clinton doesn't hold up.

From her public statements, it looks like Clinton really wants people to know her private server was "allowed," "totally above board," and "for convenience:"

	...when I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department

	...First, the laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my email for work. That is undisputed.

	...And when I got there, I wanted to just use one device for both personal and work e-mails, instead of two. It was allowed. And as I said, it was for convenience.

	...As I said, it was allowed and there was no hiding it. It was totally above board.


	...TAPPER: Right. And you said it was allowed, too.

	CLINTON: Yes, it was.

	TAPPER: Who allowed it?

	CLINTON: It was allowed under the rules of the State Department. And again --

	TAPPER: So nobody signed off on it?

	CLINTON: No, no. It was allowed.


	...But as I -- as I said, I saw it as a matter of convenience, and it was allowed. 


But the FBI found that Clinton sent an "all-staff cable" telling her State Department employees that "personal email should not be used day-to-day for business purposes and that personal email is not secure, so do not use them for business purposes." Clinton had an "obligation" to clear her personal server with the State department and dodged the question when asked if anybody "signed off" on her personal server. The State Department OIG found "no evidence" Clinton sought approval for her private server, and "would not" have approved it due to the "security risks." The FBI and State OIG found multiple State department employees, including high-level officials, were unaware Clinton used a private email server for State business. Clinton told David Muir "everybody in the government I communicated with ... knew I was using a personal e-mail," but the FBI found that multiple people in direct email contact with Clinton who didn't know she used a personal server. Clinton's server was configured in a way to hide her address. Clinton's assistant Huma Abedin told Clinton "We should talk about ... releasing your email address to the department," suggesting the State Department didn't know Clinton's email address.

Clinton's conduct at the State Department was also reckless. Clinton really wanted to use her Blackberry from her office, located in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Regarding use of unsecure Blackberry's in SCIFs, Clinton was given a memo saying "I cannot stress too strongly, however, that any unclassified Blackberry is highly vulnerable in any setting to remotely and covertly monitoring conversations, retrieving e-mails, and exploiting calendars," and a copy of a memo saying as much was found in her papers. Clinton said she "gets it."

But Clinton really wanted to use her Blackberry in her office. Security offered to "make access to the Secretary's OpenNet account on her desktop workstation as easy and convenient as possible," but Clinton never set up a computer in her office. Clinton sent thousands of emails from her blackberry while working from her office, including one titled "I'm in my office."

The FBI found that although Clinton was warned multiple times not to use her Blackberry in foreign counties, ("A primary threat is traced to the traveler’s mobile device [BlackBerry or other smart device] which is necessarily connected to the local cellular tower."), she sent hundreds of classified emails from foreign countries, including emails to the President of the United States. When asked if she was briefed on the "security implications" of emailing the President from another country, Clinton dodged the question:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/
	QUESTION: Were you ever -- were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using -- using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president?

	CLINTON: I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.


When the FBI confronted Clinton in a similar way about emailing Obama from Russia, Clinton told the FBI she "must have sent it from the plane," indicating she knew she she wasn't supposed to be emailing Obama from Russia. Even if Clinton's emails didn't help Obama's emails get on Wikileaks (Russian intelligence could insert malware into her emails in transit, for example), her actions complicate any investigation into the leak of Obama's emails.

Clinton told the public her email setup was allowed while telling the State Department it wasn't allowed. She said she "fully complied with every rule that [she] was governed by" after knowingly breaking the rules in a way that risked national security. It really, really, looks like Clinton was trying to hide something, which suggests she knew she was doing something wrong. Comey didn't explain why this wasn't good enough for his "intent" requirement.

Clinton's explanation that her email setup was for "convenience" doesn't hold up either--when her server was plagued with technical issues and blocked by the State Department, she told Abedin “This is not a good system.” When Abedin offered to get her a State Department email, Clinton said “Let’s get separate address or device, but I don’t want any risk of the personal being accessible.” (Clinton never used an official .gov email during her tenure at the State Department). This also speaks to Clinton's intent: it looks like she was trying to hide her personal emails.


Claim #3: Clinton provided all work-related emails:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/
	...the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.

	...after I left office, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work- related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totalled roughly 55,000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them. We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work- related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.

	No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.

	Fourth, I took the unprecedented step of asking that the State Department make all my work-related emails public for everyone to see.

	I am very proud of the work that I and my colleagues and our public servants at the department did during my four years as secretary of state, and I look forward to people being able to see that for themselves.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/
	CLINTON: Yes?

	QUESTION: Did you or any of your aides delete any government- related e-mails from your personal account? And what lengths are you willing to go to to prove that you didn't?

	Some people, including supporters of yours, have suggested having an independent arbiter look at your server, for instance.

	CLINTON: We did not. In fact, my direction to conduct the thorough investigation was to err on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related.

	That doesn't mean they will be by the State Department once the State Department goes through them, but out of an abundance of caution and care, you know, we wanted to send that message unequivocally.

	That is the responsibility of the individual and I have fulfilled that responsibility, and I have no doubt that we have done exactly what we should have done. When the search was conducted, we were asking that any email be identified and preserved that could potentially be federal records, and that's exactly what we did.

	JORDAN: We -- we know the National Archive has -- Secretary Clinton, we know the National Archive has said 1,250 were clearly personal. No way we should have -- no way you should have sent them to the State Department.

	And then we also know that 15, you missed, because we got those from Mr. Blumenthal when he came in -- was -- was -- for his deposition.

	CLINTON: Thank you.

	JORDAN: So if you -- you missed 15 you should have given us, and you gave us 1,250 that -- not we say, but the national archivist says -- you never should have turned over. You erred on both sides. So again, that's why we want to know the terms. Because if you've made a mistake both ways, you may to made -- might have made more mistakes. We don't know.

	CLINTON: Well, first of all, you had nine hours with one of my attorneys. And since I think the Democrats just finally released the transcript, I haven't had a chance...

	JORDAN: And I -- and I specifically asked Ms. Mills. I did.

	CLINTON: ...well...

	JORDAN: I did. I asked her about this and she gave me the -- basically the same kind of answer you're giving me.

	CLINTON: Well, she'll be happy to supplement the record if (inaudible).

	JORDAN: But she's not on the witness stand today. You are, and I'm asking you.

	CLINTON: Well, but I -- I asked my attorneys to do it. I thought that was the appropriate way to proceed.

	...GOWDY: You think our first request, there were only eight emails responsive to our first request?

	CLINTON: I can't speak to it. I believe your first request was for Benghazi. And I believe that the State Department did a diligent search. Then I believe you expanded it to Libya and weapons and maybe a few other terms. And I believe they conducted a diligent...

	GOWDY: Well, our jurisdiction hasn't grown, Madam Secretary. Our jurisdiction is the same thing it was.

	Let me ask you this. You say that you turned over everything. I don't get a chance to watch you a lot on television, but when I see you are interviewed, you make a point of saying, I turned over everything.

	CLINTON: All my work related emails, yes.

	GOWDY: How do you know that?

	CLINTON: I know that because there was an exhaustive search done under the supervision of my attorneys, and that is exactly the outcome. We turned over every work related email, in fact, as somebody referred to earlier, we turned over too many.

	The State Department and the National Archives said there are 1,246 out of the 30,000-plus that they have already determined did not need to be turned over.

	GOWDY: And you have a really...

	SANCHEZ: Regular order, Mr. Chairman.

	GOWDY: ... good group of attorneys, which makes me wonder...

	SANCHEZ: Chairman, regular order.

	GOWDY: ... how they missed 15 of them.

	CLINTON: Well if you are talking about Mr. Blumenthal, which I assume you are, he had some that I didn't have, and I had some that he didn't have. And he -- I was under no obligation to make any of his emails available unless I decided they were work related.

	And the ones that I decided that were work related I forwarded to the state.gov accounts of the people with whom I worked.

	The instant communication documents an analysis conducted by the author regarding the Department of State (DoS) tenure e-mail correspondence between the personal accounts of HILLARY CLINTON (hdr22@clintonemail.com) and HUMA ABEDIN (huma@clintonemail.com). The author analyzed e-mail correspondence across the various datasets acquired by the FBI during the course of its investigation. Ultimately, the author identified approximately 1,539 direct e-mails between hdr22@clinconemail.com and huma@clintonemail.com (i.e., no other email address was party to the e-mail communication) which were not provided to DOS by Clinton in December in 2014, but were assessed by the FBI to be work-related.

	Key Findings

	- Analysis of two datasets in the FBI's possession revealed approximately 1,539 unique work-related e-emails involving only two parties: hdr22@clintonemail.com and huma@clintonemail.com (hereafter, referred to as "CA party e-mails"). Hillary Clinton's legal team only turned over 32 CA party emails to the State Department on December 2014.

	- When conducing their review of the ~60,000 emails, Hillary Clinton's legal team possibly failed to assess the entirety of huma@clintonemail.com (hereafter, "Huma CE") e-mail correspondence with Clinton determine which were work-related. All Huma CE e-mails in the 30,524 e-mail dataset contained another search term used in the legal team review process (e.g., names and emails of key individuals, "Libya," "Benghazi"), indicating Huma CE and Abedin's name were possibly not used as their own search terms to identify those emails for production.

	QUESTION: Madam Secretary?

	CLINTON: Hi.

	QUESTION: How could the public be assured that when you deleted emails that were personal in nature, that you didn't also delete emails that were professional, but possibly unflattering?

	And what do you think about this Republican idea of having an independent third party come in an examine your emails?

	CLINTON: Well first of all, you have to ask that question to every single federal employee, because the way the system works, the federal employee, the individual, whether they have one device, two devices, three devices, how many addresses, they make the decision.

	So, even if you have a work-related device with a work-related .gov account, you choose what goes on that. That is the way our system works. And so we trust and count on the judgment of thousands, maybe millions of people to make those decisions.

	And I feel that I did that and even more, that I went above and beyond what I was requested to do. And again, those will be out in the public domain, and people will be able to judge for themselves.

	1. The ‘oh shit’ moment

	After Clinton’s staff members completed their response to the State Department for her email records in December 2014, Clinton said she told staff that she did not need them anymore.

	“In or around this same timeframe the retention policy for her email was changed as part of her move to a new personal office account,” the FBI stated in notes from Clinton’s interview.

	Former chief of staff Cheryl Mills said that Clinton in December 2014 decided she did not need access to any of her emails older than 60 days. But, according to a redacted source, another redacted entity did not modify the retention policy on Clinton’s clintonemail.com account until March 2015.

In his FBI interview on February 18, 2016, [REDACTED] indicated that he did not recall conducting deletions based upon this realization. In a follow-up FBI interview on May 3, 2016, [REDACTED] indicated he believed he had an "oh shit" moment and sometime between March 25-31, 2015 deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the PRN server and used BleachBit to delete the exported .PST files he had created on the server system containing Clinton's e-mails. Investigation found evidence of these deletions and determined the Datto backups of the PRN Server were also manually deleted during this timeframe. Investigation identified a PRN work ticketed, which referenced a conference call among PRN, Kendall, and Mills on March 31, 2015.

	Clinton emails: 'Quid pro quo' bid to bury Benghazi message

	A State Department official offered a "quid pro quo" deal if the FBI would change the classification of a Hillary Clinton email, FBI documents indicate.

	Patrick Kennedy, an undersecretary of state, had asked the email be downgraded to a lower category.

	In exchange, an FBI agent said, Mr Kennedy offered to accept an FBI request for extra agents at foreign diplomatic posts.

	QUESTION: Can you explain how you decided which of the personal e-mails to get rid of, how you got rid of them and when? And how you'll respond to questions about you being the arbiter of what you release? 

	CLINTON: ...In going through the e-mails, there were over 60,000 in total, sent and received. About half were work-related and went to the State Department and about half were personal that were not in any way related to my work. I had no reason to save them, but that was my decision because the federal guidelines are clear and the State Department request was clear.

	For any government employee, it is that government employee's responsibility to determine what's personal and what's work-related. I am very confident of the process that we conducted and the e-mails that were produced.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-hillary-clintons-email-saga/story?id=29442707
	Hillary Clinton was recorded telling a donor that she didn't like using email.

	Home video footage from 2000, shot at a fundraiser by a donor, Peter Paul, showed then-Sen. Clinton talking about how she had chosen to avoid email for fear of leaving a paper trail.

	"As much as I’ve been investigated and all of that, you know, why would I? -- I don’t even want -- Why would I ever want to do e-mail?" Clinton said.

	"Can you imagine?" she asked.



Clinton testified to Congress that she all emails she "decided that were work related [she] forwarded to the state.gov accounts of the people with whom [she] worked," and Clinton swore under penalty of perjury that 1. She turned over all work related emails to the State Department and 2. She knew Huma Abedin used an account on Clinton's private server to conduct government business. But the FBI found "1,539 direct e-mails between hdr22@clinconemail.com and huma@clintonemail.com," saying this is only a subset of the work-related emails between Clinton and Abedin on her personal server (an FBI warrant suggests 4,000). It is inconceivable that Clinton knew Abedin was using an account on her server for work, sent her work-related emails 1,539 to 4,000 times, yet forgot to turn these emails over to the State Department.

This means Clinton either lied under oath to Congress, or really thinks those 1,539 to 4,000 emails weren't work-related (it sounds like at least 2 of them were classified: http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/05/09/2017-05-09.fbi.to.ceg.-.comey.testimony.supplement.pdf). Lying under oath about her failure to turn over her work-related emails to the Government would be evidence that Clinton was trying to hide something and knew what she was doing was wrong. Still, for whatever reason, Comey didn't review Clinton's statements to Congress before his recommendation not to indict. 

Clinton's statements to the press also suggest she knew she was doing something wrong. She told the public it was her responsibility to decide which of her emails are work-related:

	QUESTION: How could the public be assured that when you deleted emails that were personal in nature, that you didn't also delete emails that were professional, but possibly unflattering? ...

	CLINTON: Well first of all, you have to ask that question to every single federal employee, because the way the system works, the federal employee, the individual, whether they have one device, two devices, three devices, how many addresses, they make the decision.

	...CLINTON: ...For any government employee, it is that government employee's responsibility to determine what's personal and what's work-related. 


But she told the FBI she left that entirely to her lawyers:


https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/Hillary%20R.%20Clinton%20Part%2002%20of%2010/view
	...CLINTON expected her team to provide any work-related or arguably work-related emails to State; however, she did not participate in the development of the specific process to be used or discussions of the locations where her emails might exist. Additionally, CLINTON was not consulted on specific emails as to their content being work-related or not.


This would open-up the opportunity for Clinton to abuse attorney-client privilege and direct her lawyers to delete federal records she wouldn't want made public (although there is one relevant exception http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-reid/the-crime-fraud-exception_b_8806598.html). Clinton's lawyers at least seemed to have attorney-client privilege in mind:

TURNER declined to provide consent to search the laptops

	...According to [REDACTED] SAMUELSON deleted CLINTON's personal emails from the original 60,000 resulting in the 30,490 emails eventually turned over to the FBI.


Clinton's lawyers told the FBI they deleted Clinton's "personal" emails--thousands of which were later found to be work-related--but Comey had trouble relaying that to Congress:


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said neither she nor anyone else deleted work related e-mails from her personal account. Was that true?

	COMEY: That’s a harder one to answer. We found traces of work- related e-mails in — on devices or in slack space. Whether they were deleted or whether when the server was changed out something happened to them. There’s no doubt that the work-related e-mails that were removed electronically from the e-mail system.


Comey also said Clinton's lawyers "didn't read" all of Clinton's emails and "just looked at the headings," then when pressed changes his story to "I don’t know whether they read them at the time:"


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	CHAFFETZ: I asked you at the very beginning, does Hillary Clinton, is there a reasonable expectation that Hillary Clinton would send and receive if not day — hourly if not daily, classified information. That’s reasonable to think that the Secretary of State would get classified information every moment. She’s not the head of Fish and Wildlife so the idea that she would turn over her e-mails, her system, her server to, what it sounds like, up to ten people without security clearances and there’s no consequence. So why not do it again?

	COMEY: That’s a question I don’t think you should put to me, you’re asking — I’m talking about my criminal investigation.

	CHAFFETZ: But how can that — there’s no intent there, does she not understand that these people don’t have security clearances?

	COMEY: Surely she understands at least some of them don’t have security clearances.

	CHAFFETZ: So she understands they don’t have security clearances and it’s reasonable to think she’s going to be in (ph) classified information. Is that not intent to provide a non-cleared person access to classified information?

	COMEY: You’re mixing it up though. I don’t think it’s reasonable to assume — mixing me up, sorry, not your fault — that someone who is maintaining your server is reading your e-mails, in fact I don’t think that’s the case here. There’s a separate thing which is when she is engaging counsel (ph) to comply with the State Department’s request, are her lawyers then exposed information that may be on there that’s classified, so…

	CHAFFETZ: And did they see any classified information? Did Hillary Clinton’s attorneys, without security clearances, see classified information?

	COMEY: As (ph) I sit here, I don’t know the answer to that.

	CHAFFETZ: It has to be yes Director, you came across 110 and they said they went through all of them.

	COMEY: Well, they didn’t read them all they just looked at headings (ph)…

	CHAFFETZ: So their excuse is we saw the e-mails but we didn’t read them?

	COMEY: You know I think I said this in my statement on Tuesday, they sorted the e-mails by using headers and search terms to try and find work related e-mails, we read them all.

	CHAFFETZ: I know that you read them all. Do you think it’s reasonable or unreasonable to think that her attorneys, under her director, did or did not read those e-mails? Because there were — let me go back to this, yes or no, were there or were there not classified e-mails that her — that Hillary Clinton’s attorneys read?

	COMEY: I don’t know whether they read them at the time.

	CHAFFETZ: They — did Hillary Clinton give non-cleared people access to classified information?

	COMEY: Yes. Yes.

	CHAFFETZ: And I’d just — I guess I read criminal intent as the idea that you allow somebody without a security clearance access to classified information. Everybody knows that Director, everybody knows that. 


But Clinton's lawyers told the FBI that they read some of the emails individually, didn't have security clearances, and that they knew they were in possession of Top Secret classified information:


https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/Hillary%20R.%20Clinton%20Part%2004%20of%2010/view

Clinton had reason to believe there was classified information on her server. Even still, she gave people without a security clearance access to this information (and with an expectation that they would access this information), which is a felony. Comey said this is OK because Clinton's "intent" was "to get good legal representation and to make the production to the State Department," which "can be a very tall order, in that circumstance."

That Clinton chose to use a convoluted, legally risky, and ultimately inadequate method for turning over her work-related emails could also be used to argue that Clinton intended to hide federal records on her email server from the public. There are other reasons to suspect this was Clinton's intent.

The Clinton Foundation had come under scrutiny for some unusual patterns in its donations and lapses in transparency. Clinton had stepped down from her foundation, but her husband had not. When confronted with this, Clinton dodged the question and defended her foundation's conduct.


Claim #4: The Clinton Foundation had "overwhelming disclosure:"


http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1606/08/acd.01.html
	COOPER: ...The foundation has obviously, raised huge sums of money for worthy causes. It's always not been transparent though. Tens of millions come from a Canadian partnership whose donors remain secret. There was a large donation from Algeria that wasn't submitted to State Department for approval. If you're president, will your husband divest himself of any association with the foundation? 

	CLINTON: Well, Anderson, we'll cross that bridge if and when we come to it, but let me try to set the record straight. We had absolutely overwhelming disclosure. Were there one or two instances that slipped through the cracks, yes. But was the overwhelming amount of anything that anybody gave the foundation disclosed, absolutely.

	Exclusive: Despite Hillary Clinton promise, charity did not disclose donors

 	In 2008, Hillary Clinton promised Barack Obama, the president-elect, there would be no mystery about who was giving money to her family's globe-circling charities. She made a pledge to publish all the donors on an annual basis to ease concerns that as secretary of state she could be vulnerable to accusations of foreign influence.

	At the outset, the Clinton Foundation did indeed publish what they said was a complete list of the names of more than 200,000 donors and has continued to update it. But in a breach of the pledge, the charity's flagship health program, which spends more than all of the other foundation initiatives put together, stopped making the annual disclosure in 2010, Reuters has found.

	In response to questions from Reuters, officials at the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the foundation confirmed no complete list of donors to the Clintons' charities has been published since 2010. CHAI was spun off as a separate legal entity that year, but the officials acknowledged it still remains subject to the same disclosure agreement as the foundation.  

	The finding could renew scrutiny of Clinton's promises of transparency as she prepares to launch her widely expected bid for the White House in the coming weeks.

	...The State Department said it was unable to cite any instances of its officials reviewing or approving new money from any foreign governments. Daley confirmed that none of the seven government donations had been submitted to the State Department for review.

	In one instance, foundation officials acknowledged they should have sought approval in 2010 from the State Department ethics office, as required by the agreement for new government donors, before accepting a $500,000 donation from the Algerian government.

	The money was given to assist with earthquake relief in Haiti, the foundation said. At the time, Algeria, which has sought a closer relationship with Washington, was spending heavily to lobby the State Department on human rights issues.

	While the foundation has disclosed foreign-government donors for years, it has not previously detailed the donations that were accepted during Clinton’s four-year stint at the State Department.

	"Secretary Clinton, do you regret the way that the Clinton foundation handled foreign donations when you were secretary of state? And your opponents say that the foreign donations and private emails are examples of the Clintons having one set of rules for themselves and one for everyone else. Do they have a point?"

	Clinton: "I am so proud of the foundation. I'm proud of the work that it has done and it is doing. It attracted donations from people, organizations from around the world and I think that just goes to show that people are very supportive of the lifesaving and life-changing work it's done here at home and elsewhere.

	"And I'll let the American people make their own judgments about that."

	Clinton's charity confirms Qatar's $1 million gift while she was at State Dept

	Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family's globe-straddling foundation in order to become secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was designed to increase transparency to avoid appearances that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by wealthy donors.

	If a new foreign government wished to donate or if an existing foreign-government donor, such as Qatar, wanted to "increase materially" its support of ongoing programs, Clinton promised that the State Department's ethics official would be notified and given a chance to raise any concerns.

	Clinton Foundation officials last month declined to confirm the Qatar donation.

	...Foundation officials told Reuters last year that they did not always comply with central provisions of the agreement with President Barack Obama's administration, blaming oversights in some cases.

	At least eight other countries besides Qatar gave new or increased funding to the foundation, in most cases to fund its health project, without the State Department being informed, according to foundation and agency records. They include Algeria, which gave for the first time in 2010, and the United Kingdom, which nearly tripled its support for the foundation's health project to $11.2 million between 2009 and 2012.

	Hillary Clinton's family's charities are refiling at least five annual tax returns after a Reuters review found errors in how they reported donations from governments, and said they may audit other Clinton Foundation returns in case of other errors.

	...The charities' errors generally take the form of under-reporting or over-reporting, by millions of dollars, donations from foreign governments, or in other instances omitting to break out government donations entirely when reporting revenue, the charities confirmed to Reuters.

	...The unsettled numbers on the tax returns are not evidence of wrongdoing but tend to undermine the 990s role as a form of public accountability, experts in charity law and transparency advocates told Reuters.

	CLINTON: ...My husband doesn't take a salary. He has no financial interests in any of this. I don't take a salary. I have no financial interests. So out of that abundance of caution and a desire to avoid even the appearance, the president-elect's transition team began working with the foundation to try to craft an agreement that would avoid the appearance of a conflict but would also ensure that the foundation can continue its work.

	Doug Band, a long-time aide to Bill Clinton, wrote the 2011 memo as part of an internal audit at the Clinton Foundation. In trying to explain his role in the Foundation, Band also brought up a series of instances he and his consulting company, Teneo Holdings, helped Bill Clinton secure for-profit contracts.

	The memo, which was being circulated to some in Clinton's inner circle including Podesta, reinforces Republican criticisms of the blurred lines between the foundation and professional interests of the Clintons and their associates.

	“Independent of our fundraising and decision-making activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities — including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements," Band wrote. "In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the President’s for-profit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, in-kind services for the President and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.”

	At one point, Band even referred to the former president’s money-making enterprises as “Bill Clinton, Inc.”

	Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal

	Before Mrs. Clinton could assume her post as secretary of state, the White House demanded that she sign a memorandum of understanding placing limits on the activities of her husband’s foundation. To avoid the perception of conflicts of interest, beyond the ban on foreign government donations, the foundation was required to publicly disclose all contributors.

	To judge from those disclosures — which list the contributions in ranges rather than precise amounts — the only Uranium One official to give to the Clinton Foundation was Mr. Telfer, the chairman, and the amount was relatively small: no more than $250,000, and that was in 2007, before talk of a Rosatom deal began percolating.

	But a review of tax records in Canada, where Mr. Telfer has a family charity called the Fernwood Foundation, shows that he donated millions of dollars more, during and after the critical time when the foreign investment committee was reviewing his deal with the Russians. With the Russians offering a special dividend, shareholders like Mr. Telfer stood to profit.

	CLINTON: Well, we're back into the political season, and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and attacks, and I'm ready for that. I know that that comes, unfortunately, with the territory. It is, um, I think worth noting that uh, the Republicans seem to be, uh, talking only about me. I don't know what they'd talk about if I weren't in the race

	...And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.

	CLINTON:  ...In this particular case, the Office of Government Ethics and the career ethics officials at the State Department have looked at the rules and concluded there is not an inherent conflict of interest in any of my husband's work at all.

	However, the foundation and the president-elect decided to go beyond what the law and the ethics rules call for to address even the appearance of conflict and that is why they signed a memorandum of understanding, which outlines the voluntary steps that the foundation is taking to address potential concerns that might come up down the road.

	...Uranium One began to snap up companies with assets in the United States. 
	
	...Still, the company’s story was hardly front-page news in the United States — until early 2008, in the midst of Mrs. Clinton’s failed presidential campaign, when The Times published an article revealing the 2005 trip’s link to Mr. Giustra’s Kazakhstan mining deal. It also reported that several months later, Mr. Giustra had donated $31.3 million to Mr. Clinton’s foundation.

	...When ARMZ, an arm of Rosatom, took its first 17 percent stake in Uranium One in 2009, the two parties signed an agreement, found in securities filings, to seek the foreign investment committee’s review. But it was the 2010 deal, giving the Russians a controlling 51 percent stake, that set off alarm bells. 

	...Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, where Uranium One’s largest American operation was, wrote to President Obama, saying the deal “would give the Russian government control over a sizable portion of America’s uranium production capacity.”

	...Uranium One’s shareholders were also alarmed, and were “afraid of Rosatom as a Russian state giant”

	...Two months later, the deal giving ARMZ a controlling stake in Uranium One was submitted to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for review. Because of the secrecy surrounding the process, it is hard to know whether the participants weighed the desire to improve bilateral relations against the potential risks of allowing the Russian government control over the biggest uranium producer in the United States. The deal was ultimately approved in October, following what two people involved in securing the approval said had been a relatively smooth process.

	COOPER: But some big donors clearly want the association with you or your husband that they linked to the foundation gives them. As president, obviously, it's vital that you and your husband not to appear to be in any way compromised. So I guess have you considered the idea of him stepping down?

	CLINTON: Again, I'm not going to consider anything until we see what the circumstances are. But let me just point out that people give lots of money to presidential campaigns, don't they?

	...COOPER: Out on the campaign trail, one of the things you said several weeks ago is your husband might be put in charge of revitalizing the economy. Is that something you're seriously looking at, a position for him in that regard?

	CLINTON: Well, I'm looking for his good advice and his extraordinary understanding of what we've got to do to help distressed communities...

	...So he has a wealth of experience and I'm looking forward to tapping into that and finding out what we can do...

	'FOBs': How Hillary's State Dept. Gave Special Attention to 'Friends of Bill' After Haiti Quake

 	In a series of candid email exchanges with top Clinton Foundation officials during the hours after the massive 2010 Haiti earthquake, a senior aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeatedly gave special attention to those identified by the abbreviations “FOB” (friends of Bill Clinton) or “WJC VIPs” (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs).

	“Need you to flag when people are friends of WJC,” wrote Caitlin Klevorick, then a senior State Department official who was juggling incoming offers of assistance being funneled to the State Department by the Clinton Foundation. “Most I can probably ID but not all.” 

 	“Is this a FOB!” Klevorick writes later, when a Clinton Foundation aide forwards a woman’s offer of medical supplies. “If not, she should go to cidi.org,” she adds, directing the person deemed not to be a Clinton friend to a general government website. 

	...However noble the motives of the officials working to get supplies into Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, numerous messages show a senior aide to then–Secretary of State Hillary Clinton coordinating with a Clinton Foundation official to identify FOBs. The Clintons have said repeatedly that the State Department never gave favorable treatment to foundation supporters in Haiti or anywhere else.

	“Nothing was ever done for anybody because they were contributors to the foundation,” Bill Clinton told CBS News’ Charlie Rose in September. “Nothing.”

	Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State

	More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. It’s an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.

	At least 85 of 154 people from private interests who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton while she led the State Department donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs, according to a review of State Department calendars released so far to The Associated Press. Combined, the 85 donors contributed as much as $156 million. At least 40 donated more than $100,000 each, and 20 gave more than $1 million.

	Donors who were granted time with Clinton included an internationally known economist who asked for her help as the Bangladesh government pressured him to resign from a nonprofit bank he ran; a Wall Street executive who sought Clinton’s help with a visa problem; and Estee Lauder executives who were listed as meeting with Clinton while her department worked with the firm’s corporate charity to counter gender-based violence in South Africa.

	The meetings between the Democratic presidential nominee and foundation donors do not appear to violate legal agreements Clinton and former president Bill Clinton signed before she joined the State Department in 2009. But the frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton. Her calendars and emails released as recently as this week describe scores of contacts she and her top aides had with foundation donors.


http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/us/politics/13text-clinton.html
	CLINTON: Well, again, this is an agreement that has been worked out between all of the parties and the fact is that the concerns that were raised in the discussions between the foundation and the president-elect's team were thoroughly discussed and they believe, and I agree, that the transparency and disclosure that is needed, which, as you said yourself, it goes beyond any kind of legal or ethical consideration.

	And not only that, there will be ongoing -- there will be ongoing reviews by anything that is brought to the attention of the career professionals.

	But I just have to go back, Senator, and try to set the record straight. [Clinton Global Initiative] is not in the memorandum of understanding because they already have a practice of disclosing all of their contributions. There is no need to require it.

	I will certainly state here that they're going to continue the practice which they've already done.

	...American affiliates of his nonprofit Grameen Bank had been working with the Clinton Foundation’s Clinton Global Initiative programs as early as 2005, pledging millions of dollars in microloans for the poor. Grameen America, the bank’s nonprofit U.S. flagship, which Yunus chairs, has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the foundation

	...“Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a friendly way,” he asked Verveer. Yunus sent “regards to H” and cited an upcoming Clinton Global Initiative event he planned to attend.

	...Clinton ordered an aide: “Give to EAP rep,” referring the problem to the agency’s top east Asia expert.

	...In another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group chairman Stephen Schwarzman as one of the attendees. Schwarzman’s firm is a major Clinton Foundation donor, but he personally donates heavily to GOP candidates and causes. One day after the breakfast, according to Clinton emails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman’s request. In December that same year, Schwarzman’s wife, Christine, sat at Clinton’s table during the Kennedy Center Honors. Clinton also introduced Schwarzman, then chairman of the Kennedy Center, before he spoke.

	Cutting Ties to the Clinton Foundation

	When Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state, the Obama administration tried to draw a line between the foundation, particularly its foreign-government sponsors, and her role. The new emails underscore that this effort was at best partly successful. “Pay-to-play” charges by Donald Trump have not been proved. But the emails and previous reporting suggest Mr. Trump has reason to say that while Mrs. Clinton was secretary, it was hard to tell where the foundation ended and the State Department began.

	Mrs. Clinton became involved in State Department deals and negotiations that also involved foundation donors or board members. She prompted multiple investigations with an arrangement that allowed Huma Abedin, her deputy chief of staff at the State Department and now vice chairwoman of her campaign, to be paid simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation and Teneo, a consulting firm run by Doug Band, the former adviser to Mr. Clinton who helped create the foundation — and who sent emails to Ms. Abedin seeking favors for foundation donors.

	The newly disclosed emails show that some foundation donors and friends, like Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin al-Khalifa of Bahrain, used foundation channels to seek access to Mrs. Clinton.

	Emails Raise New Questions About Clinton Foundation Ties to State Dept.

	WASHINGTON — A top aide to Hillary Clinton at the State Department agreed to try to obtain a special diplomatic passport for an adviser to former President Bill Clinton in 2009, according to emails released Thursday, raising new questions about whether people tied to the Clinton Foundation received special access at the department.

	The exchange about the passport, between Mr. Band and Huma Abedin, who was then a top State Department aide to Mrs. Clinton, was included in a set of more than 500 pages of emails made public by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that sued for their release.

	“Need get me/justy and jd dip passports,” Mr. Band wrote to Ms. Abedin on July 27, 2009, referring to passports for himself and two other aides to Mr. Clinton, Justin Cooper and John Davidson.

	“We had them years ago but they lapsed and we didn’t bother getting them,” Mr. Band wrote.

	Ms. Abedin emailed back six minutes later to say, “OK will figure it out.”

	Mr. Band did not explain in the email exchange why he and the others needed the diplomatic passports, and Ms. Abedin did not ask.

	The emails, which Clinton failed to include in the “work-related” cache she turned over to the State Department, show open lines of communication between the old Clinton hands running the family’s multimillion-dollar charity and those who’d moved on to help her run the State Department. The State Department was forced to turn over the emails to Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, in a Freedom of Information Act case.

	Ethics wall between State, Clinton Foundation didn’t extend to staff

	An official at the Clinton Global Initiative sent top State Department aide Melanne Verveer a 63-page list of individuals, groups and companies that had pledged money to its programs.

	An employee at another Clinton Foundation offshoot emailed Verveer looking for a job for a former colleague.

	Yet another asked whether Verveer could persuade Myanmar’s internationally acclaimed leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to attend an event.

	Verveer, a longtime Hillary Clinton confidante who served as her chief of staff at the White House before becoming ambassador at large for global women’s issues, was in regular contact with Clinton Foundation officials during her four years at the State Department, according to dozens of emails.

	...While Clinton had signed an ethics agreement to largely remove herself from issues involving her family’s foundation after she became the nation’s top diplomat in 2009, the document did not apply to her aides at the State Department.

	...“I'm . . . scratching my head about why people inside the State Department didn't think it was a good idea to insulate senior officials and their staff from any Clinton Foundation activities,” said Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight. “Restrictions applied to Hillary, but those restrictions should have applied to other officials too.”

	...The emails show the close, friendly relations between State Department and Clinton Foundation officials, providing a level of access that other groups undoubtedly wished they had with the administration.

	A top aide to Hillary Clinton at the State Department traveled to New York to interview job candidates for a top job at the Clinton Foundation, a CNN investigation has found.

	The fact that the aide, Cheryl Mills, was taking part in such a high level task for the Clinton foundation while also working as chief of staff for the secretary of state raises new questions about the blurred lines that have dogged the Clintons in recent years.

	...E-mails obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and released by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch this week raise new questions about the intermingling of Clinton Foundation business, its donors and employees under Hillary Clinton's control as a public servant. They suggest Foundation officials had no problem trying to curry favor for jobs by emailing top Clinton aides like Mills and Huma Abedin, who is now a senior adviser to Clinton's presidential campaign.

	The Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee has been investigating since 2013 whether Teneo had improper access to the highest levels of U.S. government while Clinton, the favorite to become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, was secretary of state. 

	...Founders and other workers at Teneo have also worked for the Clintons, the State Department, the Clinton Foundation or a combination of the three. Teneo describes itself as "a global advisory firm that partners exclusively with the CEOs and senior leaders of many of the world’s largest and most complex companies and organizations."

	...For a time in 2012 through early 2013, Abedin simultaneously had four overlapping sources of income: the State Department, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and Clinton's private office.

	...Clinton has said she was not directly involved in getting Abedin the waiver, known as special government employee status, which loosens some ethics restrictions that bind full-time government employees.

	The special status was created in the 1960s to allow the government to temporarily bring in expertise from the private sector.

	FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe

	New details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the Clinton Foundation, sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort, and, according to some people familiar with the matter, told agents to limit their pursuit of the case. The probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity. 

	Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case.

	It isn’t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.

	The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political-action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a Clinton Foundation board member.

	...other Clinton-related investigations were under way within the FBI, and they have been the subject of internal debate for months, according to people familiar with the matter.

	Early this year, four FBI field offices—New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark.—were collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter.

	...In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn’t go well.

	Some said that is because the FBI didn’t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career anticorruption prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn’t a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case.

	“That was one of the weirdest meetings I’ve ever been to,” one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter.

	Anticorruption prosecutors at the Justice Department told the FBI at the meeting they wouldn’t authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grand-jury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said.

	...Others, particularly Justice Department anticorruption prosecutors, felt that both probes were weak, based largely on publicly available information, and had found little that would merit expanded investigative authority.

	...In September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Clinton email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information.

	Mr. MARINO. ...was there additional immunity for Ms. Mills stating that anything on that computer cannot be used against her?

	Mr. COMEY. As I recall it, Congressman, the act-of-production immunity for Ms. Mills was: You give us this computer; we will not use—we, the Justice Department—anything we find on the computer directly against you in connection with investigation or prosecution for mishandling of classified information. I think that is how they defined it.

	Mr. MARINO. But that goes beyond act of production. Doesn’t act of production simply state that I am the agent, I can’t get on the stand and say that belongs to that individual because they simply gave it to me? It sounds like more, additional immunity was given that says: And what is on this we cannot hold against you.

	Mr. COMEY. Well, I think of it as—I still think of it as an act- of-production immunity. From my experience, that is what I would characterize that agreement.

	...Mr. MARINO. ...Why not empanel and investigative grand jury whereby you have reasonable suspicion that a crime may have been committed, and then you have the ability to get warrants, subpoenas, get this information, subpoena witnesses before the grand jury under oath ...wouldn't that have been much simpler and more effective than the way this has gone about? ...

	Mr. COMEY. Yeah. No, it is a reasonable  question. And I don’t want to talk about grand jury in connection with this case or any other case—— 

	...Mr.MARINO. I understand that clearly. Why did you not decide to go to an investigative grand jury? It would have been cleaner, it would have been much simpler, and you would have had more authority to make these witnesses testify—not the target, but the witness testify. That seems the way to go, Director. We have done it thousands of times. This just was too convoluted. 

	Mr .COMEY. Yeah, again, I need to steer clear of talking about grand jury use in a particular matter. In general, in my experience, you can often do things faster with informal agreements, especially when you are interacting with lawyers. In this particular investigation, the investigative team really wanted to get access to the laptops that were used to sort these emails. 

	Mr.MARINO. Okay. When was—— 

	Mr. COMEY. Those are lawyers’ laptops. That is a very complicated thing. I think they were able to navigate it pretty well to get us access. 


https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/114-91_22125.pdf
	Ms. JACKSONLEE. ...I understand that the FBI does not make the final call on immunity agreements. That was the DOJ. You made that clear. ...But did you consult closely with DOJ before these immunity agreements were concluded by giving—by having facts?

	Mr. COMEY. Right. Our job is to tell them what facts we would like to get access to. The prosecutor’s job is figure out how to do that. And so they negotiate—I think there were five limited immunity agreements of different kinds that they negotiated.

	Ms. JACKSONLEE. Did you or anyone at the FBI ever object to these decisions to grant immunity? Did you think they made sense?

	Mr. COMEY. No. It was fairly ordinary stuff.

	Ms. JACKSONLEE. Was the FBI or DOJ handing out immunity agreements like candy?

	Mr. COMEY. That is not how I saw it. I didn’t see it——

	Some FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they couldn’t “go prosecutor-shopping.”

	Not long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureau’s leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey’s disclosure to Congress and setting off the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign.

	Clinton Foundation Said to Be Breached by Russian Hackers


http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/us/politics/13text-clinton.html
	LUGAR: ...President Clinton is deservedly proud of the Clinton Foundation's good work in addressing HIV/AIDS, global poverty, climate change, and other pressing problems.

	But the Clinton Foundation exists as a temptation for any foreign entity or government that believes it could curry favor through a donation. It also sets up potential perception problems with any action taken by the secretary of state in relation to foreign givers or their countries.

	The nature of the secretary of state post makes recusal from specific policy decisions almost impossible, since even localized U.S. foreign policy activities can ripple across countries and continents. Every new foreign donation that is accepted by the foundation comes with the risk it will be connected in the global media to a proximate State Department policy or decision.

	Foreign perceptions are incredibly important to United States foreign policy, and mistaken impressions or suspicions can deeply affect the actions of foreign governments toward the United States. Moreover, we do not want our own government's deliberations distracted by avoidable controversies played out in the media.

	The bottom line is that even well-intentioned foreign donations carry risks for United States foreign policy. The only certain way to eliminate this risk going forward is for the Clinton foundation to forswear new foreign contributions when Senator Clinton becomes secretary of state.

	...CLINTON: ...I can absolutely guarantee you that I will keep a very close look on how this is being implemented. I will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised.

	But I think that the way that this has been hammered out is probably as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it. And we've tried to do the very best we could.

	LUGAR: Well, my time is concluded. But let me just say that the situation is unprecedented when a first lady and her distinguished husband and a foundation come together with a State Department hearing of this sort.

	I am hopeful that, as we go through the history of this, that people will not say, well, Senator Lugar, Senator Kerry, and others were pressing it. They saw the problems. And we'll get full credit, but that will not be helpful to our foreign policy, to you, to your husband, to the foundation.

	This is why I plea for you, really, to give even more consideration -- it may not be a decision made today because I appreciate the negotiations have been sizeable. And you are a good negotiator and so is your husband. So are those who have worked for you. I admire that. It's a good things for a State Department official and, particularly, the secretary of state.

	But this seems to me to be so important at the outset. This is why I've dwelled upon it, trying your patience and that of the committee, because I think it is very important. And I think you understand that.

	CLINTON: I do. And I respect you so much, Senator. And I can, you know, certainly guarantee to you that I will remain very sensitive to this and I will work with you and the chairman as we go forward.

	LUGAR: Thank you.

	CLINTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


Before she was sworn-in, Clinton was sternly warned of the risks involved in accepting foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation as Secretary of State. To address this, Clinton signed a memorandum of understanding with the Obama Administration promising to disclose foreign donations to the State Department and avoid conflicts of interest or "the appearance of conflicts of interest."

Clinton failed to disclose foreign donations multiple times. There is a pattern of Clinton giving preferential treatment at the State Department to donors to her foundation, "friends" of her Husband, and foreign governments who paid her husband exorbitant speaking fees. Clinton failed to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. She broke her promise to the Senate, the Obama administration, and the public.

Clinton promised "overwhelming disclosure" for the Clinton Foundation, but if the Clinton Foundation was subject to overwhelming disclosure, it was only because of FOIA requests of Clinton's work-related emails (http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Abedin-Complaint-File-Stamped.pdf). Clinton's state department and foundation overlapped in employees, communications, and business, and it has been said it was "hard to tell where the foundation ended and the State Department began."

Because some of the federal records on Clinton's private server gave the appearance of a conflict of interest and a violation of Clinton's agreement with the Obama administration, Clinton had an incentive to conceal these records. Reportedly, the conduct at the Clinton Foundation was enough to open an FBI investigation into the foundation, further adding to the incentive to conceal. In her public statements, Clinton said her foundation went "beyond what the law and the ethics rules call for to address even the appearance of conflict," but it is inconceivable that Clinton did not recognize the emails she wrote as Secretary of State and the business she conducted as director of the Clinton Foundation created the appearance of a conflict of interest.

But, apparently, Comey did not take this into account either when he decided there was insufficient "evidence of intent" to indict Clinton:


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	CHAFFETZ: Was the Clinton Foundation tied into this investigation?

	COMEY: Yeah I’m not going to answer that.


Reportedly, the unusual immunity agreements granted by the Justice Department during the Clinton email investigation hindered the FBI's investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It is unclear why Comey defended these immunity agreements and dodged the question when asked to testify why he didn't instead empanel a grand jury.


Ultimately, even if Comey's intent requirement is to be followed, there is evidence that Clinton had a guilty conscience, especially from her public statements. But Comey says he didn't review Clinton's statements before his recommendation to not indict:


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	WALKER: ...can you help me understand why didn’t it rise to your investigation or someone bringing that to your knowledge as far as saying this is a problem, here she is, again, Secretary Clinton lying under oath specifically about our investigation?

	COMEY: We out of respect for the legislative branch being a separate branch, we do not commence investigations that focus on activities before Congress without Congress asking us...

	...CHAFFETZ: You did not look at testimony that Hillary Clinton gave in the United State Congress, both the House and the Senate.

	...Did you review and look at those transcripts as to the intent of your recommendation.

	COMEY: I’m sure my folks did. I did not.


Comey said his "folks" reviewed her statements, but he didn't meet with all of his agents before his recommendation:

	MICA: ...But all of the agents, did they meet with you and then is that the group that said that we all vote to not recommend prosecution?

	COMEY: I did not meet with all of the agents. I’ve met with — I guess I’ve — I’ve met with all of them…


But isn't this irresponsible? It sounds like Comey went off on his own with his recommendation without reviewing all the facts important to the case.

In addition to being trained and experienced in the identification and handling of classified information, Clinton is a trained and experienced lawyer. It looks like she was using the "idiot defense" in her public statements and FBI interview:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiot_defense
	The idiot defense is a satirical term for a legal strategy where a defendant claims innocence by virtue of having been ignorant of facts of which the defendant would normally be expected to be aware. Other terms used for this tactic include "dumb CEO defense", "dummy defense", "ostrich defense", "Ken Lay defense", and "Sergeant Schultz defense".

	The term was popularized as a result of a number of high-profile corporate accounting scandal defendants claiming that all wrongdoing was performed by others, without the defendant's knowledge or consent. Attorneys for these defendants claimed that their skill was in valuation and deal-making, and that they lacked the training to recognize fraudulent accounting practices they claimed that they would have needed. However, in many cases the defendants' subordinates testified that the defendants ordered them to falsify the accounts.

	No major instances of the idiot defense being successful in criminal proceedings have been reported in American jurism to date.


When she told the FBI that "(C)" is just marking paragraphs in alphabetical order, she destroyed her own defense by making it obvious she was playing dumb (among other ways). But Comey went along with her defense in his testimony to Congress, even inserting an "intent" requirement that appears to be necessary for her defense to work in the first place. Someone who's trusted with single-handedly making a major decision about Clinton's prosecution shouldn't sound like her defense. On top of that, Comey didn't review  Clinton's public statements or confer with all of his agents before his recommendation not to indict. Comey was extremely careless in making his decision.

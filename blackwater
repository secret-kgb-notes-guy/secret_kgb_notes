	In 2010, a group of private investors purchased Xe's North Carolina training facility and built Academi, a new company, around it. Academi's Board of Directors included former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former White House Counsel and Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Jack Quinn, retired Admiral and former NSA Director Bobby Ray Inman,[48] and Texas businessman Red McCombs, who served as Chairman of the Board.[49] Quinn and Ashcroft were independent directors, without other affiliations to Academi.

Either way, their reputation precedes them

	Members of Iraq’s parliament have some questions about security contractors arriving in Iraq. They’re worried that notorious mercenary firm Blackwater has, more or less, made its way back to Iraq.

	“So far, the government has not briefed us on the arrival of private security firms for securing the highway between Anbar and Jordan, and we only heard about it from some members,” Niazi Meamaroglu, a member parliament’s security and defense committee, said in an interview with Almaalomah on Aug. 7, 2017.

	...But on Aug. 4, 2017, a U.S. federal appeals court threw out the prison sentences of three Blackwater guards involved in the Nisour Square shootings and ordered a retrial for a fourth. These developments have only further stoked Iraqis’ suspicions of the new contracts, Olive Group’s in particular.


So this recent court decision--rigged or not?

 	As France deals with a new normal, people say: ‘We are afraid. We don’t feel safe’ 

	By Sudarsan Raghavan July 16, 2016 

	...“We are afraid. We don’t feel safe,” said Louisa Rechidova, who fled the Chechen war 15 years with her family. “In Chechnya, we knew who the enemy was. Here, we don’t know who the enemy is.”

	...There’s also an unsettling recognition that terrorism is possibly becoming the new normal in their lives, something they will never be able to fully eradicate, at least as long as France remains a key player in the West’s wars against Islamist extremism.

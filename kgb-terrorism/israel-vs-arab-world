	The June 1967 War was a watershed moment in the history of the modern Middle East. In six days, the Israelis defeated the Arab armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan and seized large portions of territory including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. With the hindsight of four decades and access to recently declassified documents, two veteran scholars of the Middle East bring together some of the most knowledgeable experts in their fields to reassess the origins of the war and its regional reverberations. Each chapter takes a different perspective from the vantage point of a different participant, those that actually took part in the war, and the world powers - the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, and France - that played important roles behind the scenes. Their conclusions make for sober reading. At the heart of the story was the incompetence of the Egyptian high command under the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser and the rivalry between various Arab players who were deeply suspicious of each other's motives. Israel, on the other side, gained a resounding victory for which, despite previous assessments to the contrary, there was no master plan.


Wonder if this was by design? Nasser suspicious. They could have Israel grab a lot of territory and then set up fights around it that could fuel conflict around the world. I guess they did that and milked it for awhile, black september being one example.

	Israel's tremendous military success came not only as a result of the high level of training, expertise and courage of her pilots and soldiers, but also as a result of accurate intelligence. As Samuel Katz writes; "It is safe to assume that in no time in the history of modern warfare has a nation been equipped with such an intimate portrait of the enemy's disposition, deployment, abilities and inabilities as was the IDF…on the morning of June 5, 1967." King Hussein of Jordan later said; "'Their pilots knew exactly what to expect…their pilots had a complete catalogue of the most minute details of each of the thirty-two Arab air bases, what objectives to strike, where, when and how. We had nothing like that.'" Israel's Intelligence had been so attentive that they knew the exact timing of Egyptian patrols and their air routes. Air Force commander Motti Hod told Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin on June 4: "'For the past two weeks, we have been keeping a watch on the precise movements of the Egyptian air force…at first light they take off on patrol, staying up for an hour. Then they return to base and go off for breakfast. Between seven and eight, everything is dead, and 7:45 in the morning is the ideal time for us.'" That was the exact time that the Israeli Air Force struck.


King Hussein says Israel victory due in large part to intelligence advantage.

	The conference closed with Jordan's King Hussein. Concerned for his people, who had already borne so much and had faced such economic distress, the king described a new worry. He recalled the Israeli prime minister's unsettling remarks about the need for a "greater Israel." King Hussein reminded his hearers that this conjoined with the massive influx of Soviet Jews. He wondered where the Palestinians in the West Bank would be "pushed" as the new arrivals settled. Land to the east could be the only answer. This, the king declared, was "Israeli irredentism," an "aggression against Palestine and Jordan." One finds little to call hyperbole in the king's speech--only aggrieved worry, the concerns long carried by a ruler genuinely concerned for his people.


Where were Soviet Jews immigrating to Israel? Seems that would only contribute to the problem by giving Israel more incentive to grab territory.

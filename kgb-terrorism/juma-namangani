https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juma_Namangani
	Jumaboi Ahmadjonovich Khodjiyev (1968 – November 2001), better known by the nom de guerre Juma Namangani, was an Uzbek Islamist militant with a substantial following who co-founded and led the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and received substantial Taliban patronage, allowed to operate freely in northern Afghanistan.


Kostantin P. says he's a KGB agent (http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2347604/posts), although Kostantin is discredited. Was he right anyway?

	...Namangani was born in Namangan, located in the Fergana Valley, in 1968. He fought in the Soviet–Afghan War as a paratrooper in the Soviet Army, into which he had been conscripted in the late 1980s.[3] He was radicalised by his experiences in Afghanistan and, following the war, returned to Namangan. There, he associated with local Islamists of the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP) and the local Islamic revolutionary party Adolat (English: Justice), including Tohir Yoʻldosh, a mullah who sought the imposition of Sharia (Islamic law) in Uzbekistan.[3]


fought for Soviets, then became terrorist. Plausible recruited by KGB.


	...Namangani withdrew to the IMU's base in Mazar-i-Sharif in October 2000. At the time, he commanded a capable, multinational force of 2,000 Kyrgyz, Tajik, Uzbek, Chechen and Uyghur fighters—the latter from the Xinjiang autonomous region of China. In December, Namangani led some three hundred fighters into Tajikistan, and to Tavildara, once more. However, following intense pressure from Karimov and the international community, members of the Tajikistani government once again convinced him to return to Afghanistan, which he did again in January 2001—this time through an airlift conducted by Russian transport helicopters. Before his departure, he married his second wife, a Tajik widow of a fighter killed during the Tajikistani Civil War and mother of two sons.[3]


Russians airlifting him--I don't get it, openly support him?

	The government of Tajikistan resented Karimov, particularly since he had given sanctuary to several Tajik dissidents. Nevertheless, under enormous pressure from Uzbekistan and the international community, Tajik ministers went to Tavildara to try and persuade Namangani to return to Afghanistan. He agreed to leave—again under the supervision of Russian border guards. In January, 2001, Russian transport helicopters airlifted Namangani and three hundred men from Tavildara to the Afghan border. Conspiracy theories in the streets, in government ministries, and in foreign embassies in Dushanbe had it that the Russians were playing a double game. While Russia officially opposed the I.M.U., it turned a blind eye to Namangani’s forays from Afghanistan because Moscow was trying to pressure Karimov into accepting Russian troops and greater Russian influence in Uzbekistan. The Russians never explained why Namangani was not simply arrested.


hmmm

	By Niclas Strindell 

 	After the war, in 1989-91, Juma Namangani received training at Saboteur Training Center for KGB today known as the Russian FSB. 1991 Juma Namangani returned to his hometown of Namangan and became a local political leader opposed to the presidency of Islam Karimov. Soon after 1992, he was turned off from all official offices. He was named himself as Namangani - from Namangan. 



who's this guy?

	Karimov had already been waging his own war against Islamic extremists in Uzbekistan for nearly a decade. By the end of the 1990s, he had mostly succeeded in driving a mélange of Islamist rebel groups out of his country while consolidating his hold on power with an invasive, and often brutal, state security apparatus led by a clique of former Soviet KGB officers. In his wake, Karimov left a bloody trail of torture, extrajudicial killings, and the mass incarceration of thousands of Uzbeks — many of whose only crime was being a practicing Muslim.


Karimov also influenced by KGB?

what did they do, try to turn Uzbekistan into a terrorism factory?

well this book by Dagikhudo Dagiev says Juma was trained by the KGB:

claims happened 1989-1991, after the end of the Soviet-Afghan War


Dagiev seems more credible than Konstantin P., doesn't cite his source though

http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki%20/4013871

This cites Kostantin P.


wonder if this is true, or a rumor? seems like a long time to be trained? Zawahiri was only trained for 6 months iirc

seems legit

	By the way, Preobrazhensky has significantly expanded Litvinenko’s testimonies. He stated that, according to Litvinenko, in 1980’s and 1990’s FSB trained not only Zawahiri, but also the Uzbek Juma Namangoniy who was seen a Bin Laden’s right hand in the northern front of Afghanistan.


so is this only coming from Preobrazhensky? anyone else allege links between Juma and the KGB? Russians did shuttle him around everywhere

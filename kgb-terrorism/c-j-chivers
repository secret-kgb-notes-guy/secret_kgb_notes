	Ramzan A. Kadyrov, Chechnya's young prime minister, declared Shamil Basayev, Russia's most wanted man, "my personal enemy" and said Mr. Basayev would be held "responsible for my father's blood." Mr. Kadyrov's statements followed the posting of a videotape on Thursday in which Mr. Basayev said he had paid $50,000 to have Mr. Kadyrov's father, Akhmad, the Chechen president, killed by a bomb in 2004. In the video, Mr. Basayev said that he was prepared to pay $50,000 for Mr. Kadyrov's death but that he would prefer to pay only $25,000. Mr. Basayev has claimed responsibility for the worst terrorist acts in modern Russia, including the downing of two aircraft with bombs and the seizure of a public school in Beslan, both in 2004.

	A Giant U.S. Bomb Carries an Even Bigger Message

	By ERIC SCHMITT, HELENE COOPER and C. J. CHIVERS APRIL 14, 2017 


	WASHINGTON — The bomb that the United States dropped on an Islamic State cave complex in Afghanistan on Thursday was big — at 22,000 pounds, the most powerful conventional weapon in the American arsenal. Arguably, even bigger were the messages it sent, whether by design or not.

	To potential adversaries like Syria and North Korea, the bombing could signal deterrence. For the American public, it underscored the Pentagon’s more aggressive stance under President Trump than under his predecessor, whose administration never even debated using the weapon.


But Nicholson dropped the bomb, who Trump wanted to fire

	How Many Guns Did the U.S. Lose Track of in Iraq and Afghanistan? Hundreds of Thousands.

	By C. J. CHIVERS

	...An inkling of just how expansive these arms transfers were, and how stubbornly resistant they are to precise measurement, is apparent in a new attempt at weapons-tallying compiled in a project led by Iain Overton.

Overton sounds sketchy

	...And so no one knows where many of the weapons are, until they turn up on social media or announce themselves in combat or crime with the crack of incoming fire, a reminder of tens of billions of dollars gone into nations where violence and terrorism continue apace. What to do? If past is precedent, given enough time one of the United States’ solutions will be, once again, to ship in more guns.

	New Study Refines View of Sarin Attack in Syria

	By C. J. CHIVERSDEC. 28, 2013

	A new analysis of rockets linked to the nerve-agent attack on Damascus, Syria, in August has concluded that the rockets were most likely fired by multiple launchers and had a range of about three kilometers, according to the two authors of the analysis.

	The authors said that their findings could help pinpoint accountability for the most lethal chemical warfare attack in decades, but that they also raised questions about the American government’s claims about the locations of launching points, and the technical intelligence behind them.

	The new analysis could point to particular Syrian military units involved, or be used by defenders of the Syrian government and those suspicious of the United States’ claims to try to shift blame toward rebels.

	...Dr. Postol said those statements created a public impression that the rockets had been launched from areas at the center of government control.

	“It is clear that if the U.S. government’s claims that the allegedly observed launches came from ‘the heart’ of Syrian government controlled areas, there is a serious discrepancy between the meaning of this claim, the technical intelligence it relies on, and the technical properties of this munition,” he wrote.

	Using published data about characteristics of motors in various Grad rockets and derivatives, Dr. Postol and Mr. Lloyd calculated potential maximum ranges for the sarin-filled rockets, with an emphasis on a common Grad variant’s motor.

	Preface: We spoke for quite a while with Dr. Postol by phone, and find him to be an ethical, honest, patriotic American man. He's made some interesting discoveries debunking the Syrian chemical weapons propaganda, and so we're helping to spread his findings.

	...This is my third report assessing the White House intelligence Report of April 11, 2017.  My first report was titled A Quick Turnaround Assessment of the White House Intelligence Report Issued on April 11, 2017 about the Nerve Agent Attack in Khan Shaykhun, Syria and my second report was an Addendum to the first report.

	In the end of the conversation Alexander Litvinenko transferred us some documents for publication, marked with a signature stamp "top secret" and “of special importance”. The documents show the terrorist activity of the KGB of the USSR and are signed personally by Yury Andropov. At this A. Litvinenko added:

	“There is no doubt, that several years in the archives of Putin's special services we shall find out similar documents and we shall be convinced, that in July, 2005 secret agents of the FSB blew up innocent inhabitants of London in the underground and buses. And they blew them up executing the order of the person, who then at the summit of the G-8 was standing to the right of his "friend" Toni Blare and talking profusely about “double standards” in “the struggle against world terrorism”, demanding from him to give out for punishment his political opponents, who had found a refuge in the Great Britain”.

	The document №1: the 23 rd of April, 1974, № 1071-2/ОV “Top secret. Of Special Importance - the Special folder.

	To Comrade Brezhnev L.I.: Since 1969 the Committee of the State Security supports business secret contact to a member of the Political Bureau of the Front of the National Release of Palestine (FNRP), the head of the department of external operations of the FNRP Vaid Haddad. At the meeting with a resident of the KGB in Lebanon , taken place in April this year, Vaid Haddad in confidential conversation stated a perspective program of subversive and terrorist activity of the FNRP, which basically is reduced to the following. The main purpose of special actions of the FNRP is increase of efficiency of struggle of the Palestinian Resistance movement against Israel , Zionism and American imperialism. Proceeding from this, mainstreams of subversive and terrorist activity of the organization are:

	• Continuation of "the oil war” by the Arabian countries against the imperialistic forces supporting Israel with special means;

	• Realization of actions against the American and Israeli personnel in the third countries with the purpose of reception of trustworthy information about plans and intentions of the USA and Israel ;

	• Carrying out of subversive and terrorist activity in the territory of Israel ;

	For much of the Cold War, Soviet policy-makers believed they had an in-built advantage in the struggle with the Main Adversary and its allies for power and influence in the Middle East. If Latin America was the United States’ ‘backyard’, the Middle East was that of the Soviet Union. Israel’s special relationship with the United States made its Arab enemies, in Moscow’s view, the natural allies of the Soviet Union. Gromyko and Ponomarev jointly denounced Israel and international Zionism as ‘the main instrument of US imperialism’s assault on Arab countries’. 1 Hatred of Israel multiplied hostility to the United States in the rest of the Middle East. 2 The dramatic loss of America’s confidence in dealing with the Muslim world after the fall of its ally, the Shah of Iran, and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini was epitomized by the decision of the Carter administration not to send any congratulations to Muslim leaders to celebrate the 1,400th anniversary of Islam in 1979, for fear that it would somehow cause offence. The Soviet Union, by contrast, despite its official atheism, flooded Arab capitals with messages of congratulation.

	In 1972 Moscow put pressure on a somewhat reluctant Iraqi Communist Party to reach an accommodation with the Ba‘th regime. When thousands of Party members were imprisoned and many tortured at the end of the decade, however, Moscow stayed silent for fear of antagonizing Baghdad at a time when it was at the forefront of the Arab campaign to prevent the United States brokering a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. In Syria there was a growing breach between the long-serving Party leader and dogmatic neo-Stalinist, Khalid Bakdash, and the majority of the Party Politburo who resented both Bakdash’s autocratic leadership and Moscow’s support for the equally autocratic Asad.

on support of PLO, training them, fighting with Israel


	Far from relegating the Palestinian problem to the sidelines, as Israel had intended, the war focused international attention on the need to find a solution. 58

	Finding a solution, however, ranked low in the Soviet order of priorities.


hinting at a deliberate Palestine-Israel split by Moscow?

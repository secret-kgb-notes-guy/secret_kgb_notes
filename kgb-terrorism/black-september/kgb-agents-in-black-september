The precedent set by the KGB’s use of Sandinista 
guerrillas against US targets in Central and North 
America during the later 1960s- encouraged the Centre to 
consider the use of Palestinian terrorists as proxies in the 
Middle East and Europe. The man chiefly responsible for 
exporting Palestinian terrorism to Europe was Dr Wadi 
Haddad, deputy leader and head of foreign operations of 
the Marxist-Leninist Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (PEEP), codenamed KHUTOR,- headed by Dr 
George Habash.

Nasser? Habash?

Don't think there's any record of Habash working for KGB

PFLP generally Marxist

	Penetrating the inner circles of the mostly suspicious 
rulers of the Middle East was more difficult than 
penetrating their Moscow embassies and diplomatic 
ciphers. The KGB, none the less, had close links with the 
intelligence services of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Soviet 
Union’s first major Middle Eastern ally. His main 
intelligence adviser, Sami Sharaf, was profuse in his 
protestations of gratitude and friendship to ‘Comrade 
Brezhnev’, and claimed to be convinced that, as the 
disciple of ‘the great leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser, he 
occupies a special position in relation to his Soviet 
friends’. Probably the KGB’s longest-serving agent in 
Syria was the diplomat and lawyer Tarazi Salah al-Din 
(codenamed IZZAT), who had been recruited by the KGB 
in 1954, became Director-General of the Foreign Ministry 
in the early 1970s, and was a member of the International 
Tribunal in The Hague at the time of his accidental death 
in 1980. The KGB also claimed for a time to be able to 
influence President Asad’s youngest brother, Rifat, who 
commanded Asad’s elite ‘Defence Companies’, the best 
armed and trained units in the Syrian army, as well as the 
hit squads who operated against Syrian dissidents abroad. 
Despite, or perhaps partly because of, Saddam Hussein’s 
fascination with the career of Joseph Stalin, he seems to 
have made Baghdad a more difficult operating 
environment for the KGB than Cairo or Damascus.


"close links" with Nasser, "able to influence" Asad's brother Rifat


	All that remained thereafter was an alliance with Asad’s Syria, 
increasingly notorious as a state sponsor of terrorism as 
well as an increasing drain on the Soviet economy. No 
wonder that even the usually unsentimental Gromyko 
looked back nostalgically at the end of his long career on 
the special relationship with Nasser, arguing 
unconvincingly that, had he lived only ‘a few years 
longer’, the subsequent history of the Middle East might 
have been very different.


strongest alliance with "Asad's syria"

KGB agent or Russian official "Gromyko" lamented Nasser's death implying they could have done more in Middle East with him

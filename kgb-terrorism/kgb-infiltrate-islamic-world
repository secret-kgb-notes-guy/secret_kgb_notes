	Because SADUM was responsible for a majority of Soviet Muslims,
	its head was often referred to as the Grand Mufti. Both SADUM and the madrasahs which
	it administered in Tashkent and Bukhara were heavily penetrated by KGB agents. 9 Since
	only graduates of these madrasahs, which had a total enrolment limited to about eighty, 10
	were legally entitled to conduct religious services, the KGB thus had an informal right of
	veto over the admission of ‘undesirable’ Muslim clerics. Those identified as KGB agents
	in files noted by Mitrokhin include imams at mosques in such major Muslim centres as
	Tashkent, Dushanbe and Chimkent.

	SADUM was also used to provide cover for KGB agents travelling abroad.
	Between 1953 and 1970 (the only period for which Mitrokhin’s notes contain statistics),
	ten KGB officers and over fifty agents went on operational missions to Saudi Arabia on
	the pretext either of going on pilgrimage (Haj) to Mecca (a privilege allowed to very few
	Soviet Muslims) or of visiting Islamic theological schools. 17 In the 1970s at least one
	KGB agent, codenamed NASIB, was elected to a leading position in the World Islamic League.

	Abroad, the ambitious FCD programme to extend Soviet influence in the Islamic world rapidly degenerated into a damage limitation exercise designed to stifle as many Muslim protests against the war in Afghanistan as possible.

Russia and China might never care about nuclear non-proliferation. I think their leadership just has different priorities or culture from us, they distrust the U.S. Government's intentions, or they care more about trying to weaken the United States.

If they don't care about people like Assad and Kim Jong Un getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction and killing people, we can remind them that the public does. Actually, it looks like the U.S. might have already started doing something like this:

So long as they think of America as an enemy, America will have to treat them adversarially. Their weakness is that global public opinion does affect them and their propaganda efforts show they care about it deeply. But what they're doing will turn the public against them. They might not care about morality on their own, but the public does, and that means they have to care.

But President Trump makes this harder. He thinks making a deal with the Russians to team up and "dominate" other countries by getting them to give up their nukes "by whatever means necessary" is the solution to nuclear proliferation:

appears to be deliberately helping other countries obtain weapons of mass destruction. The significance of Trump being obsessed with this idea in 1987 and the Russians apparently using the "use WMDs to lure the U.S. into a war" tactic for decades is something you can ponder.

Another complicating factor is that the Russians have had success in manipulating U.S. leadership into making strategic errors and prolonging costly wars, and Trump trusts the Russians more than our intelligence agencies, who might be the only ones who can show him evidence of Russian attempts to manipulate him.

And I don't see any signs Trump's attitude has changed. He knows aligning with Putin is unpopular. He's lied about it before:

	“I never met Putin. This is not my best friend,” Trump reiterated

	In a newly resurfaced 2015 radio interview, Donald Trump claimed that he met Russian President Vladimir Putin and that they "got along great," contradicting his later campaign trail claims that he never met or spoke with Putin.

Now Trump is once again changing his story on Putin, but he's tried this "I'm a changed man" trick before too. Some people thought that Trump had finally "changed" or "learned" after his February address to Congress, but a few days later he started accusing Obama of wiretapping him on twitter.

Apparently, you need a small team of analysts and data visualization professionals to keep track of Trump's lies:

Other than this, it looks like Trump brought a cabal of Russian agents into the U.S. Government with him. Besides Russian agents trying to get their hands on raw intelligence in the NSC, consider the problems that Russian agents in the Justice Department can create, especially considering they are responsible for prosecuting anybody charged as a Russian agent. (This affects ongoing investigations too. How would you get any plea deals?)

In the short term, the solution to these problems is for Trump to resign.

In the long term,

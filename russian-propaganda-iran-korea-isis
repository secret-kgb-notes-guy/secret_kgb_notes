It's interesting to see how the attitude toward certain countries in Russia's propaganda changes over time.

Around the height of tensions between the U.S. and Iran surrounding their nuclear program, InfoWars took a pretty strong stance against war with Iran:

https://www.infowars.com/most-americans-and-europeans-support-impending-attack-on-iran/


But toward the end of the Obama presidency and into the Trump presidency, they take an increasingly negative stance on Iran, with less anti-war and more scaremongering and chest-thumping in their Iran coverage:

It's similar for other outlets. Breitbart barely covered Iran during the nuclear crisis under Obama:

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2010/10/31/cyber-warfare-and-the-future-of-post-castro-cuba/


But before and during Trump, they started pumping out articles about Iran funding terrorists or challenging the U.S.:

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/02/15/exclusive-iran-harassed-us-ships-three-times-year/


There's a similar pattern with Zerohedge, which is more anti-war. During the Iran crisis under Obama, they barely covered Iran besides a few conspiracy theories that the "deep state bankers" are in cahoots with Iran or something:

http://www.zerohedge.com/article/guest-post-irans-option-case-attack-its-nuclear-facilities


But under Trump, they have more than a few articles about Iran going rouge or being a threat, although they still occasionally put out articles against war with Iran (albeit while claiming war is inevitable):

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-03/coming-clash-iran



Iran isn't the only country where you can see this pattern. Brietbart's coverage of North Korea around their 2013 nuclear tests was sparse, and included a lot more light-hearted articles:

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2013/08/21/north-korean-ruler-having-trouble-finding-virgins-to-dance-for-him/


But into the Trump administration, their coverage increased in volume, especially the chest-thumping and scare-mongering kind:

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/03/29/north-korea-we-are-ready-for-pre-emptive-nuclear-strike-on-u-s/


And it's the same again for InfoWars and other outlets. During the 2013 nuclear tests they treat North Korea like a curiosity or a distraction:

But up to and during Trump's presidency they treat North Korea as a threat:

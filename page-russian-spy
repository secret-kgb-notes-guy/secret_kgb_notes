    The government’s application for the surveillance order targeting Page included a lengthy declaration that laid out investigators’ basis for believing that Page was an agent of the Russian government and knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow, officials said.

Here's one Trump advisor confirmed as a Russian spy.

They even got a FISA warrant for him. Anybody else want to whine and cry about "politically motivated  wiretapping" against the poor, innocent Trump camp?

On that note, you should call Nunes to testify in the hearings on Russia's activities.

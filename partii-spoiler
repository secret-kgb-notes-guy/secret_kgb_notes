Rubio helped Trump win the RNC primary:

	When he announced his campaign for President on Monday, Sen. Marco Rubio noted that not everyone in his party was thrilled about the idea. “I have heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn," the Florida Republican told supporters gathered at Miami's Freedom Tower.

	...Instead Republicans now seem destined for a contested primary and competitive general election that will force them to spend extravagantly to keep the seat.

	“They have no infrastructure,” said Scott Reed, who is unaffiliated with any campaign but serves as the chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “His campaign hasn’t been able to keep up with his candidacy. . . . They don’t have the operation in the states to help him get over the top. He should be a finalist going all the way to California, and he’s not.”

	One prominent Rubio supporter, who is an elected official and spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment candidly, said Sunday that he now doubts that Rubio can win and is privately preparing to support Cruz should the race narrow. He said Rubio’s recent decision to go hard in attacking Trump does not seem to have helped him.

	...There is disagreement among Rubio’s supporters over whether his decision to aggressively attack Trump — belittling his character, his appearance and even his manhood — has worked. Rubio’s advisers felt he had to mock Trump to gain national exposure amid the round-the-clock attention given to the front-runner. But others fret that the attacks have damaged Rubio’s image as a young, optimistic party leader.

	The biggest single factor was likely not Rubio’s tactics. Instead, it was the sheer number of Republican candidates vying for the non-Trump “establishment” Republican voters.

	...But Rubio’s poor performance in previous contests does not fully explain why he did so poorly in his home state, where he ended up losing every county except for Miami-Dade.


Jeanine Pirro looks like she's working for the Russians:

Interestingly, she helped Clinton keep her Senate seat in 2006:

	Sen. Clinton's GOP challenger quits race

	When Pirro launched the Senate bid against the Democrat, her announcement speech was marred by an embarrassing 30-second silence after she lost a page of her prepared remarks. Then her fundraising got off to a slow start, raising less than $500,000 in her first month.

	A majority of 62 Republican county chairs meeting last week in Albany announced their belief that Pirro should quit the Senate race but did not agree on a substitute candidate.


Like Pirro, K. T. McFarland looks like she's working for the Russians:

And she also helped Clinton keep her 2006 Senate seat:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/30/AR2006063000868.html
	NEW YORK -- The father of Republican Senate hopeful Kathleen Troia "KT" McFarland publicly denied allegations that he beat her during her childhood _ the latest twist in a series of dramatic disclosures about that have rocked the campaign of the woman hoping to unseat Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.

	... McFarland blamed violence at home for driving her younger brother Michael, who was gay, into a sexually reckless lifestyle that led to his death from AIDS in 1995. She acknowledged this week that she became estranged from her brother in the last few years of his life and would not permit her children to visit him.

	One of Sen. Hillary Clinton's Republican rivals suspended her campaign "until further notice" Monday following her teenage daughter's arrest on a shoplifting charge.

	...McFarland said Camilla is "a bright and wonderful child" who "has made a serious mistake."

	"No one is above the law," she added.

Messing with elections this way is apparently common for the Russians:

https://books.google.com/books?id=h3By77UU4nIC&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq="Divide+and+rule+is+one+obvious+ploy,+but+it+has+many+local+variants
	'Active measures' (aktivnye meropriiatia) against any opposition or would-be opposition are a key part of the new governing formula. Over and above the use of black PR and kompromat (see pages 70-1), or the cruder types of administrative resource (legal deregistration, etc.), active measures proper involve the deployment of virtual objects or events created or staged by political technologists to weaken the opposition. This chapter defines the various types of project that have been developed in the former USSR, and in the course of o doing introduces the reader to some particularly strange local terminology.

	Divide and rule is one obvious ploy, but it has many local variants -- as is indicated by the sheer number of specialist terms used in the post Soviet states. Sometimes the divisions are large, sometimes small. Parties may be split down the middle, or plagued by tiny rivals, evocatively named 'flies' (mukhi). Rival parties may appear from within, as 'off-cuts' (otkoly), or from without, the most common being artificial 'spoiler parties' (partii-spoiler), or candidates deliberately created to poach the electorates of potentially threatening oppositions. A special type of artificial rival is the 'double' (dvoinik, dubler8, or *dubl-obekt) or 'clone.' Potential splitters may lie dormant as 'cuckoos' (kukeshki), 'moles' (kroti), or as a 'Trojan Horse' (troianskii kon). Splits may be generated before an election or after, if an actual opposition proves too successful. The most ambitious projects produce total displacement or substitution of unwanted oppositions (pochkovanie, the germination of an alternative, followed by zamershchenie, substitution for the original): the artificial party surpasses its original rival, which is then left to wither on the vine. Finally, political technologists can seek to alter the entire dynamic of the political system to work against the opposition, most often via artificial polarisation or so-called 'strategies of tension'.


So what was Rubio doing? 


Rubio wasn't the only politician helping Trump in the RNC primary. It looks like some members of Clinton's campaign wanted Trump to win the RNC:

	The variety of candidates is a positive here, and many of the lesser known can serve as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right. In this scenario, we don’t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more “Pied Piper” candidates who actually represent the mainstream of the Republican Party. Pied Piper candidates include, but aren’t limited to:
  	• Ted Cruz
  	• Donald Trump
  	• Ben Carson
	We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to them seriously.

	Instead, she should take full responsibility for a mistake with no equivocation, and segue into the role of a populist prosecutor against a corrupted politics that Americans already detest.....and make a direct attack against the Donald Trump politics of daily insults and defamations and intolerance against whichever individuals and groups he tries to bully on a given day, and while defending some Republican candidates against his attacks, she should deplore their being intimidated by his insults and offering pastel versions of the intolerance he peddles.

	At this moment, listening to Hillary and reading the WSJ Saturday about Biden, both Hillary and Biden are praising Obama so effusively they become essentially champions of Obama's third term and champions of the status quo economically with lip service to change. By contrast Bernie, Trump, and the leading GOP candidates are all positioning themselves as the candidates of change which, politically, is the right place to be.

	Suggest WJC think very carefully about a strategy of literally ignoring Trump when he campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire. It will take more discipline than politicians usually have, but it might be the most powerful and effective strategy. Trump is very predictable. The media is very predictable, they will megaphone Trump taking cheap shots at WJC. My suggestion would be for WJC to have ready a litany of "responses" such as "Hillary and I spend a lot of time discussing how to create huge numbers of new jobs and get wages higher and lift up the poor to join the middle class..........."

	Right now I am petrified that Hillary is almost totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump....she has huge endemic political weaknesses that she would be wise to rectify.....even a clown like Ted Cruz would be an even money bet to beat and this scares the hell of out me.....


Budowsky keeps encouraging the Clintons to elevate Trump in the media, then says Clinton is "totally dependent on Republicans nominating Trump." It's weird that he does this after spreading a rumor that Trump is a "Clinton Plant." Interestingly, the "Trump is a Clinton plant" narrative appeared in Russia's propaganda for a little while:

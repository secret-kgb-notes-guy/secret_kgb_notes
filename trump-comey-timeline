So it's worth taking a guess at what exactly has been going on in Trump's head:

	2016 Nov 13

	...Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?

	Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't-- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --

	Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?

	Donald Trump: Well, there's been a lotta leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that.

	Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you're not sure.

	Donald Trump: Well, sure, I'm not sure. I'd wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.

	Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?

	Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I'm under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn't care because I won the election very easily. So they don't care. I never thought they did care.

	The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S.

	By ERIC LIPTON, DAVID E. SANGER and SCOTT SHANE DEC. 13, 2016 

	But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.

	Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America’s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. “Frankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,” he told reporters.

	...A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate “at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.”

	Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could “fundamentally alter the election,” he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.

	“Hope not,” Mr. Biden responded.

	Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has “got to be overt. It needs to be seen.”

	A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. “If you can’t see it, it’s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.”

	The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.

	CIA Former Deputy Director Called for Washington to Deliver a “Painful to Putin” Blow One Week Prior to Ambassador Assassination

	21 December 2016

	...Six days prior to the assassination, the hawkish former Deputy Director of the CIA (who also served as the Acting Director twice), Michael Morell, called for the US to respond to alleged Russian meddling in the US election by retaliating in a way that was both “overt” and “painful to Putin.” It should be noted that the whole narrative of Russia meddling or hacking is a faux one, as no proof has been presented

	"Highly damaging": Ex-CIA deputy director on report Trump revealed classified info

	..."This is highly damaging for two reasons," said former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell about the reported reveal, which the White House denies. "First, the Russians will undoubtedly try to figure out the source or the method of this information to make sure that it is not also collecting on their activities in Syria -- and in trying to do that they could well disrupt the source."


http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-mcmaster-statement
	The story that came out tonight as reported is false. The president of the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation. At no time, at no time, where intelligent sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. 


http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-reveals-classified-information-russians-oval-office-report-michael-morell/
	...Pelley asked Morell if he felt better that, according to National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster, no methods or sources were compromised.

	"Not a lot better… but not sharing that source or method does not make any better the problems I outlined earlier," he said.


http://theweek.com/speedreads/672826/former-cia-chief-suggests-that-intelligence-must-believe-parts-trump-russia-dossier
	Clapper also told Trump he does "not believe the leaks came from within" the U.S. intelligence community. On CNN on Wednesday, former acting CIA Director Michael Morell said that's likely true, noting that the dossier released by BuzzFeed was raw intelligence from a former British spy and not the two-page summary presented to Trump last Friday (also, U.S. intelligence agents would likely have been more careful redacting sensitive information).

	CNN's Christiane Amanpour asked what we can learn from this development. "I was a bit surprised that our intelligence community would take a private document and summarize it for the president and president-elect if they didn't know anything about the credibility of the information in it — that would be, quite frankly, unprecedented," Morell said.

	 Morell said he had learned that the former officer, Christopher Steele, paid his key Russian sources, and interviewed them through intermediaries.

	"On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire, at all," Morell said at an event sponsored by the Cipher Brief, an intelligence web site.

	"There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it."

	Morell pointed out that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Meet the Press on March 5 that he had seen no evidence of a conspiracy when he left office January 20.

	"That’s a pretty strong statement by General Clapper," Morell said.

	...Morell said Wednesday that he continues to believe that the Russian campaign of hacking, leaking and fake news, which the CIA says was designed to hurt Clinton and help Trump, was a hugely consequential action to which the U.S. has not sufficiently responded.

	Putin, he said, has suffered no consequence for his unprecedented interference in the U.S. election.

	"This has never happened before in American history on this scale, never not even close. And Putin did not pay any price for this — nothing, zero.")

	Most of the passengers on board were members of the famous Alexandrov Ensemble, better known internationally as the Red Army Choir, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

	Tom Arnold Says "Watergate Level Journalists" Are Looking Into Supposed Trump-'Apprentice' Tapes

	12:14 PM PST 12/26/2016 

	Earlier this month, actor Tom Arnold made claims to Dori Monson's Seattle-based radio show that he has unreleased recordings of president-elect Donald Trump making racist, lewd and inflammatory statements when he was host of The Apprentice. Arnold said the tapes allegedly feature Trump using "the N-word," "the C-word" and that he can be heard calling his son a "retard."

	...The actor, who had previously taken to Twitter to say that Trump's camp had contacted him about a defamation suit over the claims, laid out a litany of tweets regarding the tapes

	...I received tape via program Used in our biz 2 prevent piracy. Had a limited time password. When I received no one thought Trump would be Pres. When it became real People got scared. Can't blame them. Me & my fam get threatened by Alt Right nuts a lot plus only Billy Bush's career was hurt by "grab Her by the pussy" tape. Normally I don't think a persons private life should affect job. Didn't say anything about Natl Enquirer paying Off Trumps playmate girlfriends. Plus he'd always been nice to me but he became a bully. John McCain's POW heroism, Cruz's dad killing JFK Etc. Not the guy I knew & he was stoking racism. Lying. Basically saying anything to get elected contradicting himself.

	Then the Russian hack happened. That and him lying about releasing his taxes. I knew he'd spoken to Putin 2013 in Moscow during Miss Universe Contest from NBC guy that was with him. I shot a movie "produced" by one of his bus partners & Putin pal. Very chatty. This was 2015 so Of course he didn't think he was telling tales about what happened in 2013 to a US President. You have to see his taxes. These tapes Are disgusting but not illegal. I'm not going to out the little guy but I personally confronted 7 powerful Hollywood people who have Everything. They hate me now. Terrible career move but I believe if Russia has something they can blackmail our president with its worth The risk to me. Plus I'm a 57 year old father of 1 & 3 yr olds. I want to do all I can so there's a safe America for them. Call me & I Will give you the names of the 7 big shots and you can risk your livelihood and confront them too. All will be reviewed soon.

	The White House is preparing to announce retaliatory measures against Russia for its role in directing cyber attacks in the United States, two senior officials confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday. 

	... Earlier on Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham said Russia and Vladimir Putin should expect "bipartisan sanctions coming that will hit Russia hard, particularly Putin as an individual."

	In response to Graham's statements, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry promised retaliation in the event of new economic sanctions.

	"To be honest, we are tired of lie about the 'Russian hackers', which is being poured down in the United States from the very top," Russia Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

	She also called reports of possible new sanctions a "provocation directed by the White House".

	An update published in the Washington Post, citing a Trump official, said Flynn spoke to Kislyak by phone before the sanctions were announced, and the conversation did not cover the sanctions. The Trump official later told the Post that Flynn expressed condolences to Kislyak over the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey on Dec. 19 and then made a second call on Dec. 28 to express condolences for the crash of a Russian plane traveling to Syria and to set up the call with Putin.

	Today, President Obama authorized a number of actions in response to the Russian government’s aggressive harassment of U.S. officials and cyber operations aimed at the U.S. election in 2016.  Russia’s cyber activities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S. government.

	Obama Strikes Back at Russia for Election Hacking

	By DAVID E. SANGER
	DEC. 29, 2016 

	WASHINGTON — President Obama struck back at Russia on Thursday for its efforts to influence the 2016 election, ejecting 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the United States and imposing sanctions on Russia’s two leading intelligence services.

	The administration also penalized four top officers of one of those services, the powerful military intelligence unit known as the G.R.U.

	Intelligence agencies have concluded that the G.R.U. ordered the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations, with the approval of the Kremlin, and ultimately enabled the publication of the emails it harvested to benefit Donald J. Trump’s campaign.

	"Considering the current transition period in Washington, we still expect that we'll be able to get rid of such clumsy actions," Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, per RT, a Kremlin-funded media outlet.

	Peskov suggested that Putin might delay Russian payback over the sanctions until after Trump takes office, saying "there's no need to rush" the retaliation. "As it said before, we consider this decision and these sanctions unjustified and illegal under international law," Peskov said.

	Trump: It's time 'to move on' from claims of Russian interference in election

	The president-elect also pledges to meet with leaders of the intelligence community 'to be updated on the facts.'

	By Nolan D. McCaskill

	12/29/2016 06:14 PM EST

	Insisting it's time "to move on," President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday he will nonetheless meet next week with leaders of the intelligence community "to be updated on the facts" of alleged Russian cyberattacks.

	“It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” he said in a statement. “Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.”

	...Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer, specifically, had called on the intelligence community to offer proof of the Russian government’s interference.

	“If we’re gonna make such broad, sweeping claims about the involvement of anybody in the legitimacy of an election and the integrity of our election systems, then I think we need to have the intelligence community come forward publicly and on the record and make it clear exactly how this happened and who was responsible for it,” he told CNN.

	“Right now, we continue to get unsourced media accounts for what the activity is, and I think that’s not — that’s not acceptable,” he continued. “If truly there is someone to blame, then I think that we should have Congress notified, go through the appropriate congressional hearings, get the intelligence community — as they did in October — come out very publicly with the findings that they have.”

	“Kislyak was left with the impression that the sanctions would be revisited at a later time”

	...On Dec. 28, as word of the Obama sanctions spread, Kislyak sent a message to Flynn requesting a call. “Flynn took that call,” Spicer said, adding that it “centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and [Trump] after the election.”

	Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!
	11:41 AM - 30 Dec 2016 


Obama and Biden promise discrete retaliation for Russian election meddling, but former CIA director Mike Morell disagrees and calls for something overt. Russian propagandists later use this to blame the U.S. for the assassination of a Russian diplomat, and Russian propaganda outlets also hint at foul play in the crash of a Russian military jet that killed 60 members of a famous Russian military choir. It is unclear if the Obama Administration or Flynn understand Morell to be a Russian agent of influence, or if Trump or Flynn think the incidents constituted retaliation by the U.S. Regardless, Flynn is said to have referenced both incidents in his later calls with Kislyak.

Actor Tom Arnold claims on twitter that Russia can blackmail Trump. Arnold mostly talks about embarrassing tapes of Trump but also mentions his taxes. Most media outlets focus on the claims of tapes and generally don't take him seriously. Trump had previously denied there were any improper dealings with Russians were in his tax returns, saying he would release them when they are no longer under audit.

Trump learns that the Obama administration is planning to sanction Russia for the election meddling. When asked if the U.S. should sanction Russia, Trump says "I think we ought to get on with our lives" and casts doubt that Russia is to blame. That same day, Mike Flynn contacts Russian ambassador Kislyak to arrange a phone call between Trump and Putin.

The next day, the Obama administration officially sanctions Russia for "eroding faith in U.S. Institutions" and "sowing doubt about the integrity of our electoral process," sanctioning Russian intelligence officers and expelling 35 Russian diplomats. The FBI and DHS also release a report on how investigators linked the hacking to the Russian government. Putin makes public his warnings of retaliation and hopes the Trump administration will reverse the sanctions. Tom Arnold calls on hackers to find Trump's tax returns.

Flynn holds five calls with the Russian ambassador between the time the Russian embassy was notified of the sanctions and the time Putin decides against retaliation. Reportedly, Flynn urges Kislyak against retaliation and leaves an impression that the sanctions would be revisited by Trump. Trump tells reporters it's time "to move on" from claims of Russian interference, but promises to meet with the intelligence community to "be updated on the facts of this situation." Sean Spicer dismisses the claims of Russian interference as "unsourced media accounts." After Putin decides against retaliation, Trump praises him on twitter, saying "Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"

	Trump Promises a Revelation on Hacking

	By MAGGIE HABERMAN
	DEC. 31, 2016

	President-elect Donald J. Trump, expressing lingering skepticism about intelligence assessments of Russian interference in the election, said on Saturday evening that he knew “things that other people don’t know” about the hacking, and that the information would be revealed “on Tuesday or Wednesday.”

	Speaking to a handful of reporters outside his Palm Beach, Fla., club, Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump cast his declarations of doubt as an effort to seek the truth.

	“I just want them to be sure because it’s a pretty serious charge,” Mr. Trump said of the intelligence agencies. “If you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong,” he added, referring to intelligence cited by the George W. Bush administration to support its march to war in 2003. “So I want them to be sure,” the president-elect said. “I think it’s unfair if they don’t know.”

	He added: “And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.”

	When asked what he knew that others did not, Mr. Trump demurred, saying only, “You’ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.”

	Mr. Trump, who does not use email, also advised people to avoid computers when dealing with delicate material. “It’s very important, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way, because I’ll tell you what, no computer is safe,” Mr. Trump said.

	“I don’t care what they say, no computer is safe,” he added. “I have a boy who’s 10 years old; he can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier.”

	The comments on Saturday were a departure from a statement that Mr. Trump issued through transition officials last week, in which he said that it was time for people to “move on” from the hacking issue but that he would be briefed on the matter by intelligence officials early in the new year.

	...Mr. Trump, who has sought a warmer relationship with Mr. Putin, has repeatedly scoffed at the notion that Russia was behind the hacking, a stance at odds with members of his own party. At one point, Mr. Trump declared that the hacking may have been the work of “someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds.”

	Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign involving covert intelligence operations and overt propaganda to undermine faith in the U.S. election, disparage Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump’s election chances, the intelligence community concluded in a report released Friday afternoon. 

	...“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” the report said. 

	...“These activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations,” said the report, which was presented to President Obama Thursday and on which Mr. Trump was briefed Friday.

 	Investigation of Russian hacking is a ‘witch hunt,’ Trump says 

	By David Nakamura January 6

	As U.S. intelligence officials have raised increasing alarm this week over Russia’s meddling in the presidential election, Donald Trump has sought to recast the investigation as a matter of old-fashioned politics rather than national security.

	The president-elect has reacted to mounting pressure to take stronger steps against Russia not only by trying to discredit the intelligence community but also by suggesting that the intense Washington focus on the issue is being driven by political rivals still stung by his electoral victory.

	“This is a political witch hunt,” Trump said Friday in an interview with the New York Times ahead of a private briefing from U.S. officials on a classified 50-page report, ordered by President Obama, on Russia’s role in the election.

	Statement for the Record

	Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

	James B. Comey

	...January 6 Briefing

	I first met then- President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.

	The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified.

	...When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will “open an investigation” on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted.

	In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI’s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-Elect Trump’s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.

	Friday 6 January 2017 13.49 EST 

	Donald Trump struck a conciliatory tone with US intelligence officials after meeting with their leadership, but did not publicly support their conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential contest.

	In a statement issued ahead of the release of a declassified version of the intelligence assessment, Trump said he had “tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community”, describing his meeting with James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, and other senior intelligence officials, as “constructive”.

	His comments came after an extraordinary public feud between Trump and leaders of the intelligence apparatus he will soon control. However, Trump discussed the hack and leak of embarrassing Democratic National Committee data in generic terms, suggesting he had not moved away from his earlier statements casting attribution for the data breach as unknowable.

	“Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations,” Trump said in a Friday afternoon statement, and underlined “there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines”.

	...Trump and his deputies have treated discussion of potential foreign interference in a US election as an effort merely to delegitimize his presidency before it begins.

 	Secret CIA assessment says Russia was trying to help Trump win White House

	 By Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller December 9, 2016

	The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.

	Donald Trump is rejecting official assessments that Russia interfered with the U.S. election — reportedly to help him win the presidency — by comparing intelligence agencies' latest analyses to the past flawed claims that led to the Iraq war.

	"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction," the Trump transition team said in a statement late Friday.

	Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him

	By Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto and Jake Tapper and Carl Bernstein, CNN

	Updated 5:09 PM ET, Tue January 10, 2017

	Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.

	The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible.

	...One reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took the extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing documents was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington, multiple sources tell CNN.

	...One high level administration official told CNN, "I have a sense the outgoing administration and intelligence community is setting down the pieces so this must be investigated seriously and run down. I think [the] concern was to be sure that whatever information was out there is put into the system so it is evaluated as it should be and acted upon as necessary."

	U.S. Intelligence Chief James Clapper to Donald Trump: We Didn't Leak Russia Documents


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html
	JAN. 11, 2017

	QUESTION: But why did you spend weeks undermining U.S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement?

	TRUMP: Well, I think it’s pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it’s pretty sad. First of all, it’s illegal. You know, these are — these are classified and certified meetings and reports.

	I’ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody’s leaking it out. So, there’s — maybe it’s my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it’s them. And what I did is I said I won’t tell anybody. I’m going to have a meeting and I won’t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence.

	And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn’t know — I didn’t tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting.

	So, I don’t want that — I don’t want that. It’s very unfair to the country. It’s very unfair to our country; what’s happened. That report should have never — first of all, it shouldn’t have been printed because it’s not worth the paper it’s written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that.

	I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK.


Trump decides that U.S. intelligence agencies got the Russian hacking claims wrong, since he "knows a lot about hacking" and "hacking is a very hard thing to prove," before suggesting U.S. intelligence made the "so-called Russian hacking" story up. Chuck Schumer warns Trump that the USIC will get back at him. After USIC finally briefs Trump on Russian interference, Comey pulls Trump aside to brief him on the "dodgy dossier" and warn him he might be blackmailed. Comey also assures Trump he is not under investigation.

After the briefing, Trump declares the Russia investigation a "witch hunt," but takes a more conciliatory tone with the USIC. Three days later, the Washington post reports a "secret CIA assessment" that Russia actually intended to install Trump. Trump dismisses the entire Russian interference story and suggests intelligence agencies must be wrong since they were wrong about Iraq.

The next day, CNN reports that Trump was briefed on the dossier and suggests the USIC believes the dossier is credible. The dossier is leaked shortly afterward. Trump blames the leak on the USIC and compares them to Nazis. Trump appears to honestly think the USIC leaked the dossier.

Flynn repeatedly phoned the Russian ambassador to the U.S. on the very same day the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats over election hacking.

	Trump's offer to Russia: an end to sanctions for nuclear arms cut - London Times

	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will propose offering to end sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal with Moscow, he told The Times of London.

	Criticizing previous U.S. foreign policy in an interview published on Monday, he described the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 as possibly the gravest error in the history of the United States and akin to "throwing rocks into a beehive".

	But Trump, who will be inaugurated on Friday as the 45th U.S. president, raised the prospect of the first big nuclear arms control agreement with Moscow since the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

	"They have sanctions on Russia — let’s see if we can make some good deals with Russia," the Republican president-elect was quoted as saying by The Times.

	"For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that’s part of it. But Russia’s hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit."

	In a series of impromptu statements about nuclear weapons, Donald Trump is threatening to upend longstanding U.S. nonproliferation policy, even as his advisers contradict him and muddy his intentions.

	The president-elect had alarmed and perplexed some experts and others in Washington when he pronounced, without offering more details, via Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”

	He further escalated his call on Friday, telling the MSNBC program “Morning Joe” that he is fine with the country taking part in an “arms race” if it puts the U.S. in a stronger position against foreign adversaries.

	“Let it be an arms race … we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,” Trump said in an off-air conversation on Friday.

The IRS has said an audit does not prevents someone from releasing personal tax information.

	Putin Says Accusations in Trump Dossier Are ‘Clearly Fake’

	JAN. 17, 2017

	President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia declared on Tuesday that the political memo alleging that the Kremlin had sought for years to influence President-elect Donald J. Trump was “fake,” and he said that the effort to compile such a dossier was further evidence of the political decay of the West — one of the Russian leader’s favorite themes.

	Mr. Putin also accused the departing United States administration of trying to undermine President Obama’s successor, saying that Russian spies had better things to do than chase rich American businessmen and try to catch them in compromising situations.

	“These bogus stories are clearly fake,” Mr. Putin said at a news conference of allegations that included Mr. Trump cavorting with prostitutes while visiting Russia.

	“He is a grown man, somebody who for many years has been organizing beauty contests, interacted with the most beautiful women in the world,” he added. “You know, it is difficult for me to imagine that he ran to a hotel to meet with our young women with lowered social responsibility.”

	President Donald Trump will not release his tax returns -- even after the audit he's frequently cited is completed -- senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said Sunday.

	In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Conway was pressed on whether the White House will respond to more than 200,000 petition signatures calling on Trump to release his tax returns.

	"The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns," Conway said.

	"We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care," she said. "They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like. And you know full well that President Trump and his family are complying with all the ethical rules, everything they need to do to step away from his businesses and be a full-time president."

	WikiLeaks said it is planning to release President Donald Trump's tax returns. The controversial organization on Sunday requested anyone with access to President Trump's tax returns turn them over to the organization so it can make them public.

	...The organization has published secret documents and other leaked information about governments and organizations worldwide, on everything from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to secret information on Russian businesses and prominent individuals.

	...Over a series of months, WikiLeaks released communications between party officials and Podesta. The U.S. has since said that the documents came from accounts hacked by groups connected to the Russian government in an effort to impact the election.

	...Trump's unwillingness to release his returns has prompted WikiLeaks to turn its attention to his tax returns. It's unknown who might have access to Trump's returns and whether anyone would leak them to WikiLeaks. But if someone does, the organization seems ready to publish them once it gets them.


Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador are revealed in the press, and some speculate criminal wrongdoing. The White House denies involvement. Pence denies sanctions were discussed, citing his conversations with Flynn. Trump continues to fight with the USIC while unveiling his plan to lift Russian sanctions in exchange for a nuclear arms reduction deal. Trump had previously said he plans to "greatly expend" the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal.

Comey faces criticism for his handling of the email case and refusing to confirm if ties between Trump and Russia are under investigation, and officials and newspapers call on Comey to resign. Priebus tells journalists Trump has "confidence" in Comey, but Pence says "you'd have to ask him." Trump had previously told 60 minutes he wanted to meet with Comey before deciding to keep him on.

The Trump administration unveils a plan to "reform" the "politicized" intelligence community. The next day, the Washington Post and New York Times report that the Trump campaign is under investigation for ties and communications with Russia. Trump abruptly changes his tune, attempting gestures of goodwill toward the CIA, FBI, and Comey.

Wikileaks raises the spectre of Trump's tax returns.

	The setting: the Green Room, dinner for two. No witnesses but the Navy stewards shuttling in and out with food and drinks.

	...The conversation is strange from the start: Trump asks whether Comey wants to keep his job even though the FBI director had twice before told Trump he wanted to stay on.

	... Things get stranger from there, when Trump tells Comey: "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty."

	...Trump returns to the salacious allegations against him, calling them disgusting and saying he's considering ordering Comey to investigate and disprove them. Comey warns that such an investigation could "create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren't."

	Trump Is Said to Keep James Comey as F.B.I. Director

	By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and ADAM GOLDMAN JAN. 24, 2017 

	WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, told his top agents from around the country that he had been asked by President Trump to stay on the job running the federal government’s top law enforcement agency, according to people familiar with the matter.

	...When Mr. Comey and the president-elect met at Trump Tower for the first time this month for an intelligence briefing, Mr. Trump told the F.B.I. director that he hoped he would remain in his position, according to people briefed on the matter. And Mr. Trump’s aides have made it clear to Mr. Comey that the president does not plan to ask him to leave, these people said.

 	FBI Director James Comey to stay on in Trump administration

	By Matt Zapotosky, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller January 24 at 10:21 AM 

	...The news that Comey would stay in place became public Tuesday, some time after he began informing senior FBI officials around the country that he had been asked to continue.

	Under normal circumstances, the revelation might have been unsurprising: Comey is less than four years into a 10-year term, and it is extremely rare for a president to remove an FBI director. But President Trump had notably declined to say whether he would keep the FBI director, telling “60 Minutes” in an interview after his election that he wanted to meet with Comey first. 


https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
	...And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I'll, you know, consider. We'll see what happens.

	But we had a very nice dinner. And at that time, he told you are not under investigation...

	HOLT: That was...

	TRUMP: ...which I knew anyway.

	HOLT: That was one meeting. When was the -- when was the other two?

	TRUMP: First of all, when you're under investigation, you're giving all sorts of documents and everything. I knew I wasn't under. And I heard it was stated at the committee -- at some committee level that I wasn't, number one.

	HOLT: So, that didn't come directly from him.

	TRUMP: Then, during a phone call, he said it. And then, during another phone call he said it.

	So, he said it once at dinner and then he said it twice during phone calls.

	COMEY: I didn't modify the word investigation. It was, again, he was reacting strongly against the unverified material, saying I'm tempted to order you to investigate it. In the context of that, I said, sir, be careful about it. I might create a narrative we're investigating you personally.

	U.S. counterintelligence agents investigated national security adviser Michael Flynn’s communications with Russian officials, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday night.

	TRUMP: ...As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong.

	It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said "well I don't see" -- to me, he was doing the job.

	The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said "doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there."

The first meeting occurred on January 26, called Don McGahn first thing that morning and told him that I had a very sensitive matter that I needed to discuss with him, that I couldn't talk about it on the phone and that I needed to come see him. And he agreed to meet with me later that afternoon.

	...DURBIN: ...Ms. Yates, let me ask you about this meeting on January the 26th with White House Counsel Don McGahn. You shared the Justice Department's concern about his communications with Russia, his apparent dishonesty about those communications and his vulnerability to blackmail. Is that correct?

	YATES: That's right.

	...YATES: ...One of the -- one of the issues that Mr. McGahn raised with me in this second meeting that again was on the 27th, the day after the first meeting, was his concern because we had told him before that we were giving him this information so that they could take action.

	And he said that they were concerned that taking action might interfere with the FBI investigation. And we told him, both the senior career official and I, that he should not be concerned with it, that General Flynn had been interviewed, that their action would not interfere with any investigation and in fact, I remember specifically saying, you know it wouldn't really be fair of us to tell you this and then expect you to sit on your hands.

	What Do We Know About Investigations Into Trump Associates’ Ties to Russia?
	By Susan Hennessey, Jordan Brunner
	Wednesday, January 25, 2017

	On Sunday night, the Wall Street Journal broke a story that U.S. counterintelligence officials “had investigated” the communications of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn as part of a counterintelligence inquiry. This set off a storm of contradicting reports, with the Washington Post asserting that Flynn had been cleared and was not part of the broader investigation into Trump associates’ ties to Russia, and then still other outlets reporting that in fact the investigation was still ongoing.

	Counterintelligence agents have investigated communications by President Trump’s national security adviser, including phone calls to Russian ambassador in late December

	Michael Flynn is the first person inside the White House under Mr. Trump whose communications are known to have faced scrutiny as part of investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Treasury Department to determine the extent of Russian government contacts with people close to Mr. Trump.

	It isn’t clear when the counterintelligence inquiry began, whether it produced any incriminating evidence or if it is continuing. Mr. Flynn, a retired general who became national security adviser with Mr. Trump’s inauguration, plays a key role in setting U.S. policy toward Russia.

	The counterintelligence inquiry aimed to determine the nature of Mr. Flynn’s contact with Russian officials and whether such contacts may have violated laws, people familiar with the matter said.

 	FBI reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit 

	By Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller January 23

	The FBI in late December reviewed intercepts of communications between the Russian ambassador to the United States and retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn — national security adviser to then-President-elect Trump — but has not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government, U.S. officials said. 

	...Although Flynn’s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were listened to, Flynn himself is not the active target of an investigation, U.S. officials said. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that U.S. counterintelligence agents had investigated the communications between Flynn and Kislyak.

	TRUMP: 	...And I was a little surprised because I said "doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there."

As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.


http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/report-fbi-clears-flynn-of-wrongdoing-in-talk-with-russian-ambassador/article/2612774

	...Michael Flynn, was not the target of a counter-intelligence investigation of his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., contrary to reports on Sunday suggesting that he was, according to The Washington Post.


http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/01/25/fbi-nothing-illicit-flynns-calls-russian-ambassador/
	...The Post flatly states that “Flynn himself is not the active target of an investigation, U.S. officials said.”

	Other reports, such as a Sunday posting from the Wall Street Journal, have said it was unclear if any Flynn investigations were still in progress.

	Trump Revokes Washington Post’s Press Credentials

	by Andrew Rafferty and Alex Seitz-Wald

 	Unhappy with "incredibly inaccurate coverage," Donald Trump on Monday announced he would revoke the Washington Post's press credentials.

	“The Washington Post unfortunately covers Mr. Trump very inaccurately. Today's headline, 'Donald Trump Suggests President Obama Was Involved With Orlando Shooting' is a perfect example. We no longer feel compelled to work with a publication which has put its need for "clicks" above journalistic integrity,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement.

	US investigating Flynn calls with Russian diplomat

	Updated 7:50 PM ET, Mon January 23, 2017 

	US investigators are scrutinizing late December calls between Mike Flynn, President Donald Trump's national security adviser, and Russia's ambassador to the US as part of a broader counterintelligence investigation of Russian activities in the US, law enforcement and intelligence officials told CNN.

	The calls were captured by routine US eavesdropping targeting the Russian diplomats, according to the intelligence and law enforcement officials. But the officials said some of the content of the conversation raised enough potential concerns that investigators are still looking into the discussions, amid a broader concern about Russian intelligence-gathering activities in the United States.

	The officials all stressed that so far there has been no determination of any wrongdoing.

	...Among the communications being scrutinized are calls between Russia's ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and Flynn on December 29.

	...Michael Flynn is the first person inside the White House under Mr. Trump whose communications are known to have faced scrutiny as part of investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Treasury Department

	...A key issue in the investigation is a series of telephone calls Mr. Flynn made to Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., on Dec. 29. That day, the Obama administration announced sanctions and other measures against Russia in retaliation for its alleged use of cyberattacks to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election.

	...Officials also have examined earlier conversations between Mr. Flynn and Russian figures, the people familiar with the matter said.

	...Earlier this month, Sean Spicer, then spokesman for the Trump transition team and now White House press secretary, said the contacts between Messrs. Flynn and Kislyak dealt with the logistics of arranging a conversation between Mr. Trump and Russia’s leader.

	“That was it,” Mr. Spicer said, “plain and simple.”

	U.S. officials have collected information showing repeated contacts between Messrs. Flynn and Kislyak, these people said. It is common for American officials’ conversations with foreign officials to surface in NSA intercepts, because the U.S. conducts wide-ranging surveillance on foreign officials. American names also may surface in descriptions of conversations shared among officials of foreign governments.

	Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 | 9:17 PM ET

	 U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign several executive orders on Wednesday restricting immigration from Syria and six other Middle Eastern or African countries, according to several congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the matter.

	In addition to Syria, Trump's orders are expected to temporarily restrict access to the United States for most refugees. Another order will block visas from being issued to those from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, said the aides and experts, who asked not to be identified.

	The restrictions on refugees are likely to include a multi-month ban on admissions from all countries until the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security can make the vetting process more rigorous.

	Lavrov spoke in the lower house of parliament Thursday, referring to Donald Trump’s speech at his presidential inauguration last week, when he declared his prime policy would be “America first.” While Putin and Trump have voiced a willingness to improve their countries’ relationship, they are yet to settle on a date for a meeting.

	Trump and Putin to Speak by Phone This Weekend

 	President Donald Trump will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone this weekend, an administration official familiar with the planning said.

	The planned phone call appears to be the first conversation between the two leaders since Trump was inaugurated as the nation’s 45th president last Friday. 


http://www.newsweek.com/russias-lavrov-warns-master-deal-trump-putin-can-negotiate-too-548513
	...Whenever that meeting does occur though, Lavrov told parliamentarians, Putin was unlikely to be outmaneuvered, Russian state news agency Itar-Tass reports.

	“We have no illusions that there will be a new reset with the United States,” Lavrov cautioned. “We do not bear any naive expectations.”

	However, after explaining that both sides must work on improving relations, he told Russian politicians not to expect Putin to back down from Russia’s interests either.

	“We know that Trump considers himself a master in the (art of the) deal, but Vladimir Putin also knows how to negotiate, and does it always in the interest of Russia,” Lavrov added.

	January 27 Dinner

	The President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night

	...The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away.

	My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI’s traditionally independent status in the executive branch.

	I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not “reliable” in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody’s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President.

	A few moments later, the President said, “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner.

	...During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.

	...At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because “problems” come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work.

	Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, “I need loyalty.” I replied, “You will always get honesty from me.” He paused and then said, “That’s what I want, honest loyalty.” I paused, and then said, “You will get that from me.” As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase “honest loyalty” differently, but I decided it wouldn’t be productive to push it further. The term – honest loyalty – had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect.

	SEN. RON WYDEN: ...In talking to senator Warner about this dinner that you had with the president, I believe January 27th, all in one dinner, the president raised your job prospects, he asked for your loyalty and denied allegations against him. All took place over one supper. Now, you told senator Warner that the president was looking to, quote, get something. Looking back, did that dinner suggest that your job might be contingent on how you handled the investigation?

	COMEY: I don't know that I'd go that far. I got the sense my job would be contingent upon how he felt I — excuse me — how he felt I conducted myself and whether I demonstrated loyalty. But I don't know whether I'd go so far as to connect it to the investigation.


http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/27/politics/trump-putin-call-russia-sanctions/index.html
	Trump says he might not like Putin once he gets to know him

	Updated 9:10 PM ET, Fri January 27, 2017

	President Donald Trump said Friday it was "too early" to start discussing lifting sanctions on Russia, whose leader he will speak with Saturday, though he indicated his interest in warmer ties.

	Earlier Friday, though, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News that lifting US sanctions on Russia would be up for discussion when the two countries' leaders talk.

	"All of that is under consideration," Conway said when asked specifically whether lifting sanctions approved by the Obama administration would be considered.

	Friday night, however, a senior administration official said the current plan was not to lift the Russian sanctions.

	Saturday's phone call will be the first phone conversation between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin since the inauguration. Vice President Mike Pence also will join the call.

	"I hear a call was set up and we will see what happens," Trump said regarding sanctions during a White House news conference.

	"We're looking to have a great relationship with all countries," Trump added. "If we can have a great relationship with Russia and China and all countries, I'm all for that."

	He added, "How the relationship works out, I won't be able to tell you that (until) later. I've had many times where I thought I'd get along with people and I don't like them at all."

	Trump also said there was "no guarantee" on a path forward.

	The President said he hopes to have a good rapport with Putin but that it was possible they would be adversaries.

	"I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens," he said. 

	Obama imposed sanctions on Russia throughout his eight years as president and earlier this month expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the United States for alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.



On Jan 22nd, the Wall Street Journal reports that Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador are under legal scrutiny. On Jan 23rd, the Washington Post reports that the FBI reviewed Flynn's communications and found no wrongdoing, launching a flurry of contradicting reports. The next day, Flynn is interviewed by the FBI at the White House. Flynn does not have a lawyer present during the interview. That morning, the same authors at the Washington Post report that Trump intends to keep James Comey as FBI director. However, both Comey and Trump will later say that they discussed whether or not Comey should stay as FBI director at the Jan 27th dinner, three days later.

Later the day of Jan 24th, Trump announces plans for his travel ban. The text of the executive order is leaked the next day to widespread protest. Putin threatens Trump about something the following morning.

On the 26th, Yates warns the White House that Flynn has been compromised, vulnerable to blackmail for lying to the Vice President about discussing sanctions with the Russians. Yates tells the White House that Pence repeating this lie to the media further amplifies the potential for blackmail. It is unclear why Trump himself does not correct Pence. Yates also tells the White House that Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador are problematic in and of themselves, and that Flynn has been interviewed by the FBI. It is unclear if Trump learned that Flynn was interviewed without a lawyer, although he might have been able to infer such by examining White House visitor logs.

The next day, the 27th, Trump schedules a phone call with Putin, apparently at Putin's request. This appears to be the phone call Flynn had promised to the Russian ambassador on December 28th. The agenda for the call is said to include U.S. sanctions on Russia. Trump also schedules his dinner meeting with Comey around the same time. That afternoon, McGahn returns to meet Yates with questions about the applicability of certain criminal statues and whether or not the DOJ would pursue a criminal case. McGahn also requests to schedule a meeting to see the underlying evidence of Flynn's conduct. If the White House ever reviews the evidence, it is not before Yates is fired later on the 31st.

Later the evening of the 27th, Trump and Comey meet in a one-on-one setting. According to Comey's testimony, Trump begins by asking Comey if he wants to stay on as FBI director, and offers him the opportunity to leave. Comey tells Trump he wants to stay, but warns that he is not "reliable" or "on anybody's side" in the political sense. In response to this, Trump tells comey "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty." Comey doesn't say anything in response.

During the dinner, Trump asks Comey if he's under investigation, and Comey tells Trump he's not under investigation. Comey had previously assured trump he was not under investigation on the 6th. Trump will go on to say the dinner was the first time he learned he was not under investigation.

Trump also tells Comey he's considering ordering him to investigate the salacious allegations in the dossier. Comey tells Trump to think carefully, as that could make it look like the FBI were investigating Trump. Trump says he would think about it and asks Comey to think about it.

At some point during the dinner, Comey explains to Trump that it is important for the FBI and DOJ to be independent of the White House. Comey says that some Presidents try to encroach on the independence of the DOJ when "problems" come from Justice, but this makes the problems worse.

At the end of the dinner, Trump tells Comey he's glad he wants to stay on, and once again tells him "I need loyalty." Comey tells him "You will always get honesty from me." Trump says "That's what I want, honest loyalty." Comey replies "You will get that from me."

 	For first call between President Trump and Putin, Moscow hopes ‘everything will be positive’ 
	By David Filipov January 28

	...Trump has also vehemently denied allegations that his positive view of Moscow resulted from business ties or blackmail by Russian intelligence, and he has sought to portray his upbeat words about Putin as a positive.

	He has consistently argued that Russia can be a strong ally instead of a strategic ally, saying the two countries could cooperate on counterterrorism in general and rolling back the Islamic State in particular, as well as countering nuclear weapon proliferation. Trump has suggested that Washington can work with Moscow on the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine and that he might be ready to negotiate down NATO’s strong defensive posture on Russia’s western border.

	January 29, 2017 —Officials say the thorny matter of U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russia didn't come up during President Donald Trump's first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which suggests that the more difficult obstacles to warmer relations between their nations can wait.

	...The White House official who spoke after the statement was issued said Putin brought up several times that Islamic terrorism was a "common foe" for the U.S. and Russia. The official was not authorized to disclose details of the call by name and insisted on anonymity.

	Addressing topics not mentioned in the White House statement, the Kremlin said that the two leaders discussed the importance of "restoring mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between business circles of the two countries."

	Trump to Prioritize Persecuted Christians as Refugees

	By Anugrah Kumar , Christian Post Contributor
	Jan 28, 2017 

	President Donald Trump signed new orders to "keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America" and pledged to give priority to persecuted Christians as refugees.

	"We are going to help them (persecuted Christians). They've been horribly treated," Trump told CBN News Friday, the day he signed new orders to tighten America's refugee and visa policies.

	"Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair," Trump continued in the interview with The Brody File, which will be aired Sunday.

	...The newswire says President Trump also plans to suspend issuing visas for people from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 30 days.

	...some Christian groups have expressed dismay at Trump's plans to curb refugee resettlement.


http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/trump-travel-ban-q-and-a/
	This is the "extreme vetting" Trump promised during the campaign, but it still seems to have caught folks by surprise.

	Team Trump apparently never ran the order by officials at the Justice Department. Homeland Security officials weren't given much guidance about how the order would be implemented or enforced. Thus the confusion and chaos.

	The ban snared green card holders and people with valid visas alike. Some travelers who were in the air when Trump signed the order weren't able to enter the country when they landed. Some were detained. Others were sent back to where they flew in from. Lawsuits began to fly and by Saturday night a federal judge had temporarily and partially blocked Trump's order.

	How big is the backlash?

	It's global. Hundreds showed up at airports across the country -- from New York to Atlanta to Dallas to Seattle -- to protest. Vocal crowds against the order gathered outside the White House. 

	...There's panic in some US colleges and universities that have a large number of foreign students. Some students and faculty members fear they'll have to decide between careers or families. Some raced back to the United States as the executive order loomed, so they would be able to complete a degree. Now they're left to wonder when they'll get to see their families again if they remain in the United States.

	...There's hardship for those who planned to come to the States as well. Mahmoud Hassan, an 18-year-old Syrian in Damascus, accepted an offer to attend MIT earlier this year, but because of the ban, he said his "dreams are basically ruined."

	Giuliani: Trump asked me how to do a Muslim ban 'legally'

	By Rebecca Savransky - 01/29/17 08:48 AM EST

	Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) said in an interview on Saturday that President Trump had previously asked him about legally implementing a "Muslim ban."

	But Giuliani then disputed the notion that the president's sweeping executive order barring refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim nations amounts to a ban on Muslims.

	"I’ll tell you the whole history of it: When he first announced it, he said ‘Muslim ban,'" Giuliani said on Fox News.

	"He called me up, he said, ‘Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.’"

	Giuliani said he then put together a commission that included lawmakers and expert lawyers.

	"And what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger," Giuliani said.

	"The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible."

	The leaks coming out of the Trump White House right now are totally bananas
	By Chris Cillizza February 2

	Here are a few leaks that have come out of the Trump administration in just the last 24 hours:

	* President Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after condemning a refugee deal with the country and telling Turnbull "this was the worst call by far" he has had with a world leader.

	* Trump threatened — his administration insisted it was "light-hearted" — Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto with sending American troops into his country.

	* The White House asked Judge Thomas Hardiman to drive toward D.C. to amp up the drama in advance of Trump's Supreme Court pick on Tuesday night. (Hardiman was passed over in favor of Colorado federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch.)

	...What's truly remarkable is that the leaking appears to be growing even more frequent and even more deleterious to President Trump's image within just the last few days.

	Trump White House besieged by leaks

	By Niall Stanage - 02/09/17 

	Donald Trump’s White House has sprung a remarkable number of leaks since his inauguration.

	The question is where they’re coming from.

	Barely a day goes by without some unusual tale emerging from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Recent examples in a single New York Times story included the assertion that White House aides have held meetings in the dark because they can’t figure out how the lights work and that the president is fond of watching television alone in his bathrobe.

	Trump took to Twitter to assert that the Times “writes total fiction” about him, while White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that the president does not even own a bathrobe.

	More serious matters have been leaked as well, such as descriptions of Trump’s call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Trump apparently said a U.S.-Australia deal on refugees, agreed to by President Obama, was “the worst deal ever,” and told Turnbull their conversation was “the worst call by far” among several he had held with world leaders that day.

	The leakiness of the Trump White House has been a boon to the press corps, who find themselves feasting on the juicy insider details that were hard to come by during the “No Drama Obama” years.

	But to those rooting for a successful Trump presidency, the picture looks very different.

	“There have been a ton of leaks. It seems that everyone has their own leaking apparatus,” lamented one Trump ally who works outside the White House.

	...The speculation about who’s up and who’s down among Trump’s cadre of advisors won’t subside anytime soon, however.

	In part, that’s because any leak that emerges is immediately parsed for clues as to the source — and whom they might be intending to harm.

 	National security adviser Flynn discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador, despite denials, officials say 

	By Greg Miller, Adam Entous and Ellen Nakashima February 9

	National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former U.S. officials said.

	Flynn’s communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were interpreted by some senior U.S. officials as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.

	Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Asked in an interview whether he had ever done so, he twice said, “No.”

	Flynn Is Said to Have Talked to Russians About Sanctions Before Trump Took Office

	By MATTHEW ROSENBERG and MATT APUZZO
	FEB. 9, 2017

	Weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, discussed American sanctions against Russia, as well as areas of possible cooperation, with that country’s ambassador to the United States, according to current and former American officials.

	Throughout the discussions, the message Mr. Flynn conveyed to the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak — that the Obama administration was Moscow’s adversary and that relations with Russia would change under Mr. Trump — was unambiguous and highly inappropriate, the officials said.

	Without fanfare, Trump reverses Obama order on Justice Department succession
	USA TODAY 3:46 p.m. ET Feb. 10, 2017

	President Trump has quietly signed an executive order changing the order of succession in the Department of Justice, reversing an executive order by President Obama signed just last month.

	The order appears to be the first that Trump has not signed in a public ceremony. It's dated Thursday — the same day Attorney General Jeff Sessions was sworn in — but was not posted to the White House website until Friday morning. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.

	The executive order spells out who will act as the nation's highest law enforcement officer if the attorney general dies, resigns or becomes incapacitated. Such orders have been routine since the 2001 terrorist attacks, but Trump's is notable becomes it comes two weeks after he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order banning travelers from seven predominately Muslim countries.

	That time, Trump went outside the official order of succession — as he has the right to do — to elevate Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to acting attorney general.

	February 14 Oval Office Meeting

	On February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counter-terrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the semi-circle of chairs.

	...The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me.

	...the President began by saying, “I want to talk about Mike Flynn.” Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.

	The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information – a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks...

	...The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, “He is a good guy and has been through a lot.” He repeated that Flynn hadn’t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” I replied only that “he is a good guy.” (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would “let this go.”

	The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President.

	I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn’s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency.

	Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence

	By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT, MARK MAZZETTI and MATT APUZZO
	FEB. 14, 2017

	WASHINGTON — Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials.

	American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said. The intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election.

	The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation.

	But the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.

	...The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed.

	The F.B.I. has closely examined at least three other people close to Mr. Trump, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative; and Mr. Flynn.

	The Political Assassination of Michael Flynn
	The national security adviser was the appetizer. Trump is the main course.
	by Eli Lake

	February 14, 2017, 3:09 PM GMT

	If we are to believe the Trump White House, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn just resigned because he lied about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the vice president. As White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway told NBC's "Today Show" on Tuesday: "Misleading the vice president really was the key here."

	...A better explanation here is that Flynn was just thrown under the bus.

	...Flynn was a fat target for the national security state. He has cultivated a reputation as a reformer and a fierce critic of the intelligence community leaders he once served with when he was the director the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama. Flynn was working to reform the intelligence-industrial complex, something that threatened the bureaucratic prerogatives of his rivals.

	He was also a fat target for Democrats. Remember Flynn's breakout national moment last summer was when he joined the crowd at the Republican National Convention from the dais calling for Hillary Clinton to be jailed.

	...In the end, it was Trump's decision to cut Flynn loose. In doing this he caved in to his political and bureaucratic opposition. Nunes told me Monday night that this will not end well. "First it's Flynn, next it will be Kellyanne Conway, then it will be Steve Bannon, then it will be Reince Priebus," he said.

	Flynn Was Brought Down by Illegal Leaks to News Media, Trump Says
	FEB. 15, 2017

	President Trump lashed out at the nation’s intelligence agencies again on Wednesday, saying that his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, was brought down by illegal leaks to the news media, on a day of new disclosures about the Trump camp’s dealings with Russia during and after the presidential campaign.

	“From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,” Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. “It’s a criminal action, criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time before me, but now it’s really going on. And people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.”

	With his statement and a burst of early-morning posts he made on Twitter, Mr. Trump tried to shift attention from damaging questions about contacts with Russia by Mr. Flynn and others close to the president, arguing that the outrage is not those contacts, but the leaks about them.

	White House Plans to Have Trump Ally Review Intelligence Agencies

	By JAMES RISEN and MATTHEW ROSENBERGFEB. 15, 2017 

	WASHINGTON — President Trump plans to assign a New York billionaire to lead a broad review of American intelligence agencies, according to administration officials, an effort that members of the intelligence community fear could curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president’s worldview.

	The possible role for Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management, has met fierce resistance among intelligence officials already on edge because of the criticism the intelligence community has received from Mr. Trump during the campaign and since he became president. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump blamed leaks from the intelligence community for the departure of Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, whose resignation he requested.

	FEBRUARY 16, 2017, 2:55 PM

	Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.

	As you know, Mike Pompeo has -- has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.

	...QUESTION: Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?

	TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.

	...QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador --

	TRUMP: No, I didn't.

	QUESTION: -- prior to your --

	TRUMP: No, I didn't.

	QUESTION: -- inauguration.

	TRUMP: No, I didn't.

	QUESTION: And then fired him --

	TRUMP: Excuse me.

	QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

	TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.

	...QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?

	TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been.

	QUESTION: During the election?

	TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody...

	QUESTION: So you're not aware of any contact during the course..

	TRUMP: Look, look, look...

	QUESTION: ... of the election?

	TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question?

	QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no?

	TRUMP: Russia is a ruse.

	I know you have to get up and ask a question. It's so important.

	Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia.

	...TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.

	He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw.

	Flynn in FBI interview denied discussing sanctions with Russian ambassador 

	By Sari Horwitz and Adam Entous February 16 at 4:37 PM

	Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn denied to FBI agents in an interview last month that he had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States before President Trump took office, contradicting the contents of intercepted communications collected by intelligence agencies, current and former U.S. officials said.

	The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy, as lying to the FBI is a felony


Trump takes makes his widely anticipated/dreaded call with Putin, denying that he is being blackmailed. 
According to the Kremlin's readout of the call, Trump and Putin discussed "restoring beneficial trade and economic ties" and plans to organize a personal meeting between Trump and Putin in July. Pence was present for the call. The discussion of "economic ties" and plans for the meeting do not appear in the White House readout.

Meanwhile, Trump's travel ban is causing world-wide chaos. The ban caught the Justice Department and other U.S. officials by surprise, greatly adding to the confusion. Trump and his surrogates make public statements establishing the travel ban as religiously motivated, which is unconstitutional. Yates refuses to defend the ban, and Trump fires her for "betraying the Justice Department." Trump stresses that Yates is an Obama Administration appointee.

In the next few days, the White House is besieged by leaks showing, among other things, that Trump is incompetent and attempts to bully and threaten other leaders. The White House investigates the leaks, which Trump takes "very seriously." Trump blames the leaks on "Obama people." 

The leaks take-on new form on February 9th, when it is revealed that Flynn discussed the U.S. sanctions to deter election meddling with the Russian ambassador and made it unambiguous they would be revisited after Trump takes office. Meanwhile, Flynn is still vulnerable to blackmail, and Trump has not informed Pence that he was mislead. Flynn attempts to install an aide who's security clearance is denied by the CIA. Trump denies knowledge of reports that Flynn discussed sanctions.

It is around this time that Jeff Sessions is sworn in as Attorney General. Trump quietly signs an executive order changing the order of succession for the Attorney General, making Dana Boente next in line. Trump had previously picked Boente to replace acting AG Yates.

Trump keeps Flynn on for four more days. On the 13th, it is reported that Yates warned that White House Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail for lying to Pence. Trump fires Flynn a few hours later. Trump complains on twitter that the "real story" is the "illegal leaks coming out of Washington." Trump later charges that Flynn was brought down by "criminal leaks" from "intelligence." Wikileaks agrees.

The next day, Russia deploys a new nuclear missile, violating international law. Trump doesn't respond. House Republicans block Congress from obtaining Trump's tax returns.

In an oval office meeting that day, Trump singles out Comey to talk to him about Flynn and rant at him about leaks. Trump tells Comey Flynn "didn't do anything wrong" in talking to the Russians, but he had to fire him because he "misled the Vice President." Trump asks Comey "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go," although Comey doesn't make clear what exactly Trump wants Comey to "let go." Comey interprets it as Trump asking him to drop any investigation connected with Flynn's statements to the Russians.

Shortly after the meeting, it is reported that Trump's campaign was in repeated contact with Russian intelligence. Trump continues to publicly rant about leaks from the Intelligence Community and blame them on Obama-appointees. Trump claims the leaks will stop once he "gets his people in place," and his administration threatens to "review" U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump gives a press conference, threatening intelligence agencies, asserting he has nothing to do with Russia, and stressing that "Flynn did nothing wrong." A few hours later, the Washington post reports that Flynn lied to the FBI, and may by charged with a felony.

	Rep. Schiff: ‘Circumstantial Evidence of Collusion’ Between Trump Campaign, Russia

	Despite denials from some top intelligence officials that there was any evidence of collusion between associates of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russian operatives while Moscow tried to interfere with the 2016 election, Rep. Adam Schiff on Sunday defended the House Intelligence Committee continuing to look into the matter.

	Two weeks ago on "Meet The Press," James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence under President Obama, denied that any evidence of such collusion existed while he oversaw the work of U.S. intelligence agencies. The Trump administration has also reiterated those denials. 

	But this Sunday on "Meet The Press," Schiff, D-Calif., told host Chuck Todd, "I was surprised to see Director Clapper say that because I don’t think you can make that claim categorically as he did. I would characterize it this way at the outset of the investigation: There is circumstantial evidence of collusion."

	20 March 2017

	FBI director James Comey has confirmed for the first time that the FBI is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.

	However, Mr Comey said his agency had seen no evidence to back up President Trump's claim that his phones had been tapped by the Obama administration.

	He was giving evidence to the congressional intelligence committee.

	The Trump administration said nothing had changed and there was "no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion".

	Analysis: FBI bombshell creates 'a big gray cloud' over Trump's White House

	Published 3:48 p.m. ET March 20, 2017

	WASHINGTON — Not since Watergate.

	FBI Director James Comey delivered more than one bombshell at a rare public hearing of the House Intelligence Committee Monday. He said there was no evidence to back up President Trump's accusation that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, joining congressional leaders and intelligence officials in discounting Trump's unsubstantiated claims.

	What was more explosive, though, was Comey's matter-of-fact confirmation that the FBI is investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Russia in the effort by one of the United States' leading global adversaries to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential campaign.

	...The allegations “are more serious than anything we’ve seen in recent decades,” says political historian Matthew Dallek, a professor at George Washington University and author of Defenseless Under the Night: The Roosevelt Years and the Origins of Homeland Security. “That is far from a lone instance of an illegal leak or a president fudging the truth under oath about sex with a White House intern.”  While we obviously don’t know what evidence the FBI has assembled and whether anybody will ever be charged with a crime, the scope of the investigation appears to encompass at least several of Trump’s chief advisers and perhaps Trump himself."

	...it would not only be a serious crime,” California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said in his opening statement. “It would also represent one of the most shocking betrayals of our democracy in history.”

	After more than five hours of testimony, Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., closed the hearing with an almost anguished plea to Comey to finish the investigation as soon as possible. “The longer this hangs out here, the bigger the cloud is,” he said. “There is a big gray cloud that you have now put over people who have very important work to do to lead this country.”

	The White House dismissed the whole idea as preposterous.

	“James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia,” Trump declared in the first of a string of early-morning tweets Monday on his personal Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump. “This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!”

	...There were signs that Trump was watching — and no signs that he was ready to temper his rhetoric.

	While Comey was testifying, there was a tweet on the official @POTUS Twitter account. “FBI Director Comey refuses to deny he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia,” it said — suggesting that the former president himself was behind the leak. Another tweet declared, “The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.”

	That wasn’t quite what they said, Comey and Rogers told the panel when the tweet was read to them, in what amounted to an awkward fact-checking exchange in real time with their boss. They said they hadn’t drawn conclusions on the impact of Moscow’s efforts.

	Comey did predict that Russia’s efforts to disrupt American elections weren’t over.

	“They’ll be back in 2020,” he warned. “They may be back in 2018. And one of the conclusions they may draw ... is they were successful.”

	If true, this CNN report about Russia could destroy Trump’s presidency.

	“There is more than circumstantial evidence now” that the Trump campaign colluded with Russians, Schiff told MSNBC. 

	...It suggests that evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials may exist, something that Trump lackeys have been denying for months. And collusion is serious enough that it could bring down this administration.

	...At the very least, it’s hard not to see this leak as being retaliation for Nunes’s weird and unethical freelancing earlier in the day. Russia is, as Nunes put it, “a big gray cloud” over the administration. This report only makes that cloud bigger and grayer.

	Biden on Trump, Russia relationship: 'What in the hell are we doing?'

	03/22/17

	Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday knocked the Trump administration for its relationship with Russia, criticizing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's decision to visit Russia before a NATO meeting.

	"The notion that there's still this romance with Putin ... I'm told [Tillerson] has decided he's going to go visit Putin before he goes to the NATO conference? What in the hell are we doing?" Biden told reporters at the Capitol.

	On Monday, it was announced that Tillerson would not attend an April 5-6 meeting of NATO foreign ministers. He is instead staying in the U.S. for a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tillerson will then travel to Russia for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

	Grassley relents on Rosenstein nomination

	03/24/2017 

	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is finally letting the nomination of a top Justice Department official advance, after refusing to schedule a vote because he had not received sufficient information on the ongoing Russia probe.

	The committee announced Friday that it will take up the nomination of Rod Rosenstein for deputy attorney general at its business meeting on Monday. Grassley had complained the administration was stonewalling his requests for more information, and earlier this month said he would not schedule a vote for Rosenstein until he was briefed by the FBI.

	Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is requesting information about the relationship between the FBI and the opposition research firm behind an unsubstantiated dossier whose contents included salacious allegations against President Donald Trump and his campaign aides.

	Grassley has sent a letter to the firm, Fusion GPS, asking for the firm to disclose who funded the dossier, which was compiled by a former British intelligence agent, and whether the company was in touch with the FBI or Justice Department about it.

	“When political opposition research becomes the basis for law enforcement or intelligence efforts, it raises substantial questions about the independence of law enforcement and intelligence from politics,” Grassley wrote in the letter.

	...The Washington Post reported that the FBI reached an agreement with the former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, to continue his research — though the deal reportedly never came to fruition.

	There's a Russian storm over Trump's struggling presidency

	By Stephen Collinson, CNN

	Tue March 28, 2017

	Washington (CNN)The darkening storm over Russia is now looming over President Donald Trump's innermost circle.

	The intrigue now threatening to swamp Washington politics deepened on Monday when Trump's son-in-law and trusted adviser, Jared Kushner, offered to testify to senators about meetings with senior Kremlin officials -- including the head of a bank closely linked to President Vladimir Putin's government.

	And more revelations about a secret trip to the White House complex by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes spurred claims by Democrats that he was in league with the President's aides to subvert his own panel's investigation into Moscow's alleged election meddling and ties to the Trump campaign.

	It was all too much for the President. Perhaps prompted by rising speculation about Russia, Trump launched a Twitter barrage Monday night, possibly to distract attention from stories damaging to his White House by attacking a familiar target.

	"Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech....money to Bill, the Hillary Russian 'reset,' praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!" Trump wrote in a pair of tweets.

	...But the storm isn't likely to break soon: There will be new Russia-related headlines on Thursday, when an intelligence committee hearing offers senators their first chance to go on the record addressing the widening controversy embroiling Trump and Russia.

	...Political troubles

	...One Gallup tracking poll Monday put his approval ratings as low as 36% -- far lower than most presidents go across the span of the entire terms.

	..."It is just astonishing how little support there is for anything the President wants to do," said a senior Democratic official. "No matter what the President tries to do next, the public is going to be opposed to it."

	March 30 Phone Call

	On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to “lift the cloud.” I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn’t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him.

	Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week – at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, “We need to get that fact out.” (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)

	The President went on to say that if there were some “satellite” associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn’t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren’t investigating him.

	In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn’t brought up “the McCabe thing” because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe’s wife) campaign money. Although I didn’t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.

	He finished by stressing “the cloud” that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn’t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.

	Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later.

	The U.S. intelligence official who “unmasked,” or exposed, the names of multiple private citizens affiliated with the Trump team is someone “very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world,” a source told Fox News on Friday. 

	Intelligence and House sources with direct knowledge of the disclosure of classified names told Fox News that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., now knows who is responsible -- and that person is not in the FBI.

	...“The main issue in this case, is not only the unmasking of these names of private citizens, but the spreading of these names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security or an investigation into Russia’s interference in the U.S. election,” a congressional source close to the investigation told Fox News.

	10:02 AM - 1 Apr 2017


Comey reveals that Trump's associates are under a counterintelligence investigation for ties to Russia while Trump rants about it on twitter. That and subsequent revelations are said to put a "big gray cloud" over the Trump administration. Trump continues to insist Obama spied on him. Meanwhile, Trump's associates are stiffing NATO and blocking Sally Yate's testimony on Flynn. Biden wonders "what the hell are we doing." Schiff insists there is evidence of cover-ups and collusion and Grassley raises a stink about FBI connections with the "dirty dossier."

The Washington Post reports that Trump tried to block Sally Yates from testifying, adding another "big gray cloud" to the "storm" of Russian collusion over Trump's presidency. Trump complains the media is treating him unfairly. Republicans vote to block Congress from obtaining Trump's tax returns, and the next day Lavrov mentions that it's "still possible" for Trump "renew cooperation" in fighting terrorism in Syria, saying "We will be sharing this approach, I am sure." Trump doubles down on allowing Assad to stay put.

Meanwhile, Comey mentions that he "knows when he's going to cause a storm" but he "doesn't care." On the morning of March 30th, Flynn offers to testify for the Russia probe in exchange for immunity. That same morning, Trump calls Comey.

Trump says he has nothing to do with Russia, and "the cloud" of the Russia investigation is impairing his dealmaking abilities. He asks Comey what they could do to "lift the cloud." Trump and Comey agree that the FBI should do the investigation well, but Trump reemphasizes that "the cloud" is causing him problems.

Reading between the lines of Comey's statement, it looks like Trump asks Comey why he publicly confirmed the counterintelligence investigation into his associates, and Comey tells him that Congress wanted it. 
This call is said to be the third time Comey tells Trump he is not under investigation. Trump repeatedly tells Comey "we need get it out" that he is not under investigation, and says it would be good to clear the names of his associates if they haven't done anything wrong. 

In an apparent attempt to bargain, Trump points out to Comey that he hadn't mentioned "the McCabe thing" (that McCabe had the appearance of a conflict of interest regarding donations from Clinton associates) since Comey said McMabe is "honorable." Comey repeats that McCabe is "honorable" and Trump reiterates that the "cloud" is hurting his dealmaking and he wants the public to know he's not under investigation. Comey tells him "I'll see what we can do."

After the meeting, a journalist claims to have found Comey's twitter account, which is following several high-profile journalists who have been reporting on the Russia story in the Washington Post and New York Times. Trump tweets that Flynn should ask for immunity but maintains that the Russia investigation is a "witch hunt" and an "excuse" by the media and Democrats.

Trump continues to tweet that the Russia investigation is made up and that Obama intelligence officials are out to get him.

	Statement by President Trump on Syria

	April 06, 2017

	THE PRESIDENT:  My fellow Americans:  On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians.  Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women, and children.  It was a slow and brutal death for so many.  Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack.  No child of God should ever suffer such horror.

	Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.  It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.  There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council.  

	Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically.  As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies.  

	Tonight, I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types.  We ask for God's wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world.  We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed.  And we hope that as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will, in the end, prevail.  

	Goodnight.  And God bless America and the entire world.  Thank you.

	- Haley on CNN: “Regime change is something that we think is going to happen because all of the parties are going to see that Assad is not the leader that needs to be taking place for Syria.”

	- Tillerson on CBS: “[W]e believe that the first priority is the defeat of ISIS, that, by defeating ISIS and removing their caliphate from their control, we have now eliminated at least or minimized a particular threat, not just the United States, but to the whole stability in the region. And once the ISIS threat has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria."

	- National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on FOX: “[W]hat Ambassador Haley pointed out is it's very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime. Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to affect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves, what are we doing here?”

	The way Ross describes it, on April 6, in the middle of President Trump's summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, "just as dessert was being served, the president explained to Mr. Xi he had something he wanted to tell him, which was the launching of 59 missiles into Syria. It was in lieu of after-dinner entertainment."

	Trump, Xi talked Syria strike over 'beautiful' chocolate cake

	President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox Business, said he informed Chinese President Xi Jinping about the air strikes he authorized in Syria over the "most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen" at his ocean-side club and that the communist leader was "enjoying it."

	"I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner. We're now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen and President Xi was enjoying it," Trump said, before telling interviewer Maria Bartiromo he was told the strike was ready to go.

	Trump added that he told Xi that the United States had "just fired 59 missiles ... heading to Iraq," incorrectly identifying the country he was striking when relaying the story to Bartiromo.

	Of Xi, Trump said, "And he was eating his cake. And he was silent."

	But in a Monday evening statement, a senior administration official disputed that report.

	Kremlin: Putin won’t meet with Tillerson Wednesday
	By Mark Hensch - 04/10/17 04:12 PM EDT

	The Kremlin says Russian President Vladimir Putin does not plan on meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he visits Moscow on Wednesday.

	...The decision to not receive Tillerson could raise tensions between the U.S. and Russia following the American airstike on Syria. The Trump administration launched a missile strike last week in response to a chemical attack officials attributed to Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces.

	Russia has been a staunch backer of Assad during the country's civil war, and Peskov said Monday that it would not abandon that support.

	"Returning to pseudo-attempts to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out,” Peskov said.

But one voice has not been heard from: that of Mr. Trump himself.

	April 11 Phone Call

	On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I “get out” that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that “the cloud” was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.

	He said he would do that and added, “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.” I did not reply or ask him what he meant by “that thing.” I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.

	That was the last time I spoke with President Trump.

	FBI obtained FISA warrant to monitor former Trump adviser Carter Page
	By Ellen Nakashima, Devlin Barrett and Adam Entous

	The FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of an adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump, part of an investigation into possible links between Russia and the campaign, law enforcement and other U.S. officials said.

	The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page’s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials. 

	...Applications for FISA warrants, Comey said, are often thicker than his wrists, and that thickness represents all the work Justice Department attorneys and FBI agents have to do to convince a judge that such surveillance is appropriate in an investigation.

	Asked if he thought Russia knew of the sarin nerve gas attack that the U.S. and its allies have pinned on Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose government has been facing armed opposition in a yearslong civil war, Trump hedged.

	“I think it's certainly possible. I think it's probably unlikely,” he said. “I would like to think that they didn't know, but certainly they could have.”

	...Trump has been signaling a more aggressive and antagonistic approach to Syria and Russia, Assad’s primary backer, since the chemical attack — moving away from his campaign promises to forge better ties with Moscow and to avoid U.S. military interventions in the Middle East.

	Putin says U.S.-Russia ties worse since Trump took office

	Levels of trust between Moscow and Washington have deteriorated since U.S. President Donald Trump took office, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.

	Asked about relations since Trump became president, Putin said, according to a transcript of the interview released by the Kremlin: "One could say that the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved, but rather has deteriorated."

	Asked about accusations that Syria's government launched a chemical weapons attack in Idlib province, Putin said that Damascus had given up its chemical weapons stocks.

	Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!
	6:16 AM - 13 Apr 2017 


The cloud of Russian collusion over Trump's presidency lingers. Assad attacks his own people in one of the worst chemical attacks in years. Russian involvement is suspected. Putin posits that 95% of the worlds terrorist attacks are orchestrated by the CIA.

Putin signals less than enthusiastic support for Assad. Trump orders a cruise missile strike on a Syrian airfield over dinner with Chinese President Xi. Trump seems to think this makes him very cool. The strike is largely symbolic, although Mattis will later claim it destroyed "40% of Syria's air force."

Russia warns of "serious consequences" for the missile strike. Protestors around the country demand Trump to release his tax returns, and larger protests are planned for next week. Trump's administration can't make up its mind on whether or not it supports Assad.

U.S. intelligence finds Russian foreknowledge of the chemical strike and evidence of a cover up. The Trump administration disputes this. Trump remains silent on his Syria policy. Putin refuses to meet Tillerson at his next visit to Moscow.

The next day, Trump calls up Comey again to ask him his request to "get it out" that he is not under investigation. Comey tells Trump he forwarded his request to Boente but hasn't heard back. Trump tells Comey that "the cloud" was getting in the way of his ability to do his job, and says he might have "his people" reach out to Boente. Comey says this is what Trump should do. Trump says he will, and adds "Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know." Trump ends the call saying he will reach out to Boente. That was the last time Comey spoke to Trump.

The next day, the Washington post leaks that Trump advisor Carter Page is under investigation for acting as an agent of Russian intelligence. Trump posits that maybe it's possible that Russia had foreknowledge of the Syria attack. Putin charges that U.S. relations have gotten worse under Trump. Trump tweets that "things will work out fine between the U.S.A and Russia."

	Trump says he "never spoke" to Treasury secretary about releasing tax returns

	WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said he never spoke to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin about releasing his tax returns, after Mnuchin said last week that Mr. Trump has "no intention" of releasing them.

	"Well, I never spoke to him about it. Honestly, he's never asked me about it," Mr. Trump said from the White House in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS News' "Face the Nation."

	"I said, number one, I'm under audit," the president continued. "Right now, I'm under audit. After the audit is complete. It's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return. You've seen the pictures. My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor. When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big. My tax return is this high."

	By Jordain Carney - 05/01/17 

	Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is pushing FBI Director James Comey to clarify "inconsistencies" in information about a controversial opposition research dossier on President Trump. 

	Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Comey saying there are discrepancies between information he gave during a March briefing and Justice Department documents made available after the closed-door meeting. 
 
	"There appear to be material inconsistencies between the description of the FBI’s relationship with Mr. Steele that you did provide in your briefing and information contained in Justice Department documents made available to the Committee only after the briefing," Grassley wrote in the letter dated April 28. 
 
	The GOP senator warned that "whether those inconsistencies were honest mistakes or an attempt to downplay the actual extent of the FBI's relationship" with Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent who wrote the dossier, the bureau needs to respond to Grassley's previous request for information.

	Trump’s discussion with Putin is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. that afternoon in the Oval Office, it said Monday.

	...Russia is under intense congressional and media scrutiny following FBI Director James Comey’s announcement in March about his bureau’s activities.

	Comey said that the FBI is probing Moscow’s interference in the 2016 presidential race, including collusion between Russian officials and members of Trump’s campaign.

	The House Intelligence Committee has invited Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to appear before the panel Tuesday as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling.

	The Senate Intelligence Committee, which has its own investigation of Moscow’s intrusions, reportedly brought on two additional staffers last week.

	Trump repeatedly praised Putin during his election campaign, adding his administration would improve relations with Russia.

	Putin's Disappointing Phone Call With Trump

	Reports of a planned meeting were less than met the eye.

	Julia Ioffe May 2, 2017 

	On Tuesday afternoon, after President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had their third phone call in about as many months, news emerged that the two leaders would finally meet this summer. For those tracking the Trump-Putin dance, it might seem just another date in a long love affair.

	The reality, however, looks far bleaker for Putin.

	Consider this: After three phone calls and an infinite amount of hope for a Trump-Putin detente dashed against the rocks of American politics, all that Trump and Putin could agree on, according to the readouts provided from each side, was that the war in Syria is bad and that maybe a personal meeting this summer would be good. But even that part about the meeting, it turned out, was just in the Kremlin’s account of the presidential phone call. The White House made no mention of any agreement to meet...

	Trump, Putin signal new effort to cooperate on Syria
	May 2, 2017 — 4:35pm

	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled improving prospects for cooperation in Syria Tuesday in what the White House called a "very good" phone discussion that included a focus on setting up safe zones in the war-torn nation.

	The Kremlin said the leaders also agreed to try to set up their first in-person meeting in July, on the sidelines of an international summit in Germany. The White House later confirmed that information.

	Tuesday's call marked the first time Trump and Putin have spoken since the U.S. launched missiles against an air base in Syria, an attack that outraged Russia, one of the Syrian government's strongest backers. The U.S. military action sparked new tensions between Washington and Moscow, with top U.S. officials sharply condemning Putin's continued support for embattled Syrian leader Bashar Assad.

	But the leaders appeared to again be edging toward closer cooperation following Tuesday's call.

	On May 2, eight days before Lavrov showed up at the White House, Russian President Vladimir Putin was on the phone with Trump and made a request. ­Putin had “new ideas” about stopping the civil war carnage in Syria, according to a senior U.S. official, and noted that his top diplomat, Lavrov, would soon be visiting the United States for a previously scheduled meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

	“Will you see him?” Putin asked Trump, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private talks.

	“Yes,” Trump replied.

	Comey forcefully defends ‘painful’ decision on Clinton probe
	The FBI director says idea that agency could have swayed election makes him 'mildly nauseous.'
	05/03/2017 10:52 AM

	Comey's testimony was the most expansive and detailed insight the FBI chief has offered into his thinking during the days before the election, but it seemed to do little to quiet Democratic senators' concerns that he applied a double standard that resulted in Clinton being kneecapped in advance of the vote even though the FBI was also — without public notice —conducting a politically explosive investigation into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russia.

 	...Comey said his instincts as an ex-prosecutor were not to do anything that might affect an election, but he concluded that worrying about electing Trump would be wrong to even consider. "Not for a second," he said he replied to the junior FBI attorney asking whether that should be factored in. "Down that path lies the death of the FBI."

	As it turned out, the newly discovered emails were not momentous.

	...The FBI chief also disclosed that his investigators turned out to be wrong about something else: how long it would take to pore through the messages. He said they initially told him there was no chance they could finish before the election, but a computer program the FBI compiled ultimately culled out duplicate messages and had the task completed in just a week.

	"We'd seen them all before," Comey said of the messages.

	The timing issue is pivotal because had Comey known that the work could be done in advance of the election, he might have waited to notify Congress once the content of the messages was clear. Instead, he sounded what many Democrats regard as a false alarm that deflated Clinton's campaign.

 	...At the outset of the hearing, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) suggested that there's little substance to the story that has dominated Washington in recent months — allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. 

	...Under questioning from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Comey confirmed he discussed the issue with Yates, who is set to testify about the issue next week before a Senate subcommittee chaired by Graham.

	Yates is expected to tell senators she delivered a strong and unusual warning to the White House in January that Flynn had lied about his contacts with Russia and was vulnerable to being compromised. Flynn was ousted by Trump less than a month later after it became public that he had misled his colleagues about his phone conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

	KERRY PICKET
	2:13 PM 05/06/2017 

	WASHINGTON–Republican political operative Roger Stone says he still communicates with President Donald Trump and the last conversation he had was relatively recent.

	Stone noted he has not spoken to the president about Congress’s investigation into Russia’s influence peddling in the 2016 election and that lawmakers wish to talk to Stone.

	“I think the president and I understand that any conversation we had in October was monitored and I imagine my conversations these days are monitored, so we keep it pretty general. And by and large it is my policy not to discuss what I have had to discuss with the President,” Stone said on The David Webb Show on SiriusXM Patriot Ch. 125 Friday night.

	“You guys both know I’m a writer and I’m a memo writer. I’m a prolific writer. I’m happy to tell you my opinion any time you want to know, so I do write to the president from time to time just political thoughts and so on.”

	When asked when he last spoke with Trump, Stone replied, “In a little while now I would say I don’t want to characterize it, but less than a week ago.”

	He added, “He’s easier to find on the weekends. He’s got more time on his hands.”

	WHITEHOUSE: You could perhaps have waited until you actually had seen the agents 302 from the interview of General Flynn. Why go ahead of that? Why not wait?

	YATES: Well, because this was a matter of some urgency, we...

	WHITEHOUSE: Describe.

	YATES: In making the determination about notification here, we had to balance a variety of interest. For the reasons that I just described a few minutes ago, we felt like it was critical that we get this information to the White House, because in part because the vice president was unknowingly making false statements to the public and because we believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians.

	...YATES: ...And, in fact, Mr. McGahn responded back to me to let me know that anything that General Flynn would've said would have been based -- excuse me -- anything that Vice President Pence would have said would have been based on what General Flynn had told him.

	YATES: ...one of the questions that Mr. McGahn asked me when I went back over the second day was essentially, why does it matter to DOJ if one White House official lies to another White House official?

	And so we explained to him, it was a whole lot more than that and went back over the same concerns that we had raised with them the prior day, that the concern first about the underlying conduct itself, that he had lied to the vice president and others, the American public had been misled.

	YATES ...and in fact, I remember specifically saying, you know it wouldn't really be fair of us to tell you this and then expect you to sit on your hands.

	...KLOBUCHAR: ...And one of the White House officials has described the notification that you provided warning them of this as a heads up. How would you describe a heads-up?

	YATES: Well at the risk of trying to characterize. I mean we were there to tell the White House about something we were very concerned about and emphasized to them repeatedly. It was so they could take action.

	...DURBIN: On February 14th, after General Flynn resigned, Sean Spicer said, and I quote, "There was nothing in what General Flynn did in terms of conducting himself that was an issue." Do you have any idea what he meant by those words?

	YATES: No. I'm not -- all I can say is he didn't reach that conclusion from his conversation with us. I can't speak to how he arrived at that.

	...KLOBUCHAR: And during that meeting did they mention -- anyone mention that this refugee order was about to come out?

	YATES: No.

	KLOBUCHAR: Did the acting Attorney General of the United States?

	YATES: No and that was one thing that was of concern to us, is that not only was department leadership not consulted here and beyond department leadership, really the subject matter experts, the national security experts, not only was the department not consulted, we weren't even told about it. I learned about this from media reports.

	KLOBUCHAR: So you learned about it after the meeting at the White house Council from the media.

	YATES: Right.

	KLOBUCHAR: And then it's true that during your hearing, then Senator Sessions, now the Attorney General actually asked you if the views the President wants to execute are unlawful, should the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General say no? And what did you say?

	YATES: And I said yes, the Attorney General should.

	...YATES: Well, certainly, in the course of the meetings, both on the 26th and 27th, Mr. McGahn certainly demonstrated that he understood that this was serious. So he did seem to be taking it seriously.

	I -- you know, I don't have any way of knowing what, if anything, they did. If nothing was done, then certainly, that would be concerning.

	...Had I remained at the Department of Justice, and if I were under the impression that nothing had been done, then, yes, I would have raised it again with the White House.

	...WHITEHOUSE: And that was the end of this episode, nobody came over to look at the material?

	YATES: I don't know what happened after that because that was my last day with DOJ.

	...YATES: I think they're coming back, and we have to do a whole lot more, both to harden our election systems, our state election systems, to ensure that folks out there know when they're looking at news feeds, that it may not be real news that they're reading.

	I think that we have to do more to deter the Russians, and it wouldn't hurt to prosecute a few folks...

	GRAHAM: Without objection. General Clapper, on March 5, 2017, you said the following to a question. Here's the question.

	Does intelligence exist that can definitely answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials? You said we did not include any evidence in our report.

	And I say our, that's the NSA, the FBI, the CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything — that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.

	Chuck Todd (ph) then asked, I understand that, but does it exist? You say no, not to my knowledge. Is that still accurate?

	CLAPPER: It is.

	GRAHAM: Ms. Yates, do you have any evidence — are you aware of any evidence that would suggest that in the 2016 campaign anybody in the Trump campaign colluded — colluded with the Russian government intelligence services in improper fashion?

	YATES: And Senator, my answer to that question would require me to reveal classified information. And so, I — I can't answer that.

	GRAHAM: Well, I don't get that because he just said he issued the report. And he said he doesn't know of any. So, what would you know that's not in the report? ...

	YATES: Well, I think that Director Clapper also said that he was unaware of the FBI counter intelligence investigations.

	GRAHAM: Would it be fair to say that the counter-intelligence investigation was not mature enough to come to his — to get in the report. Is that fair, Mr. — Mr. Clapper?

	CLAPPER: I — that's an — that's a possibility.

	...FEINSTEIN: The Guardian has reported that Britain's intelligence service first became aware in late 2015 of suspicious interactions between Trump advisers and Russian intelligence agents. This information was passed on to U.S. intelligence agencies.

	Over the spring of 2016, multiple European allies passed on additional information to the United States about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians. Is this accurate?

	YATES: I -- I can't answer that.

	FEINSTEIN: General Clapper, is that accurate?

	CLAPPER: Yes, it is and it's also quite sensitive.

	FEINSTEIN: OK. Let me ask you this.

	Senators: Rosenstein knew Comey would be fired before writing memo

	Rod Rosenstein already knew James Comey was going to be fired as FBI director when he wrote the three-page memo that the White House would later assert had sealed Comey’s fate, multiple senators said Thursday as they left a highly-anticipated briefing with the deputy attorney general.

	Rosenstein learned Comey was being ousted on May 8, according to Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), but the memo is dated May 9 — the day the firing took place.

	MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

	FROM: ROD J. ROSENSTEIN

	DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

	SUBJECT: RESTORING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI

	...As you and I have discussed, however, I cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.

	The director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution.

	...There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. On July 5, however, the Director announced his own conclusions about the nation's most sensitive criminal investigation, without the authorization of duly appointed Justice Department leaders.

	Compounding the error, the Director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation. Derogatory information sometimes is disclosed in the course of criminal investigations and prosecutions, but we never release it gratuitously. The Director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial. It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.

	...Concerning his letter to the Congress on October 28, 2016, the Director cast his decision as a choice between whether he would "speak" about the decision to investigate the newly-discovered email messages or "conceal" it. "Conceal" is a loaded term that misstates the issue. When federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation, we are not concealing anything; we are simply following the longstanding policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public information. In that context, silence is not concealment.

	...Although the President has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former Department officials. The way the Director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.

	Dear Director Comey:

	I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.

	While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgement of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.

	It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.

	I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

	Donald J. Trump

	Readout of President Donald J. Trump’s Meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia

	President Donald J. Trump met today with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia, following on the visit of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Moscow last month. President Trump emphasized the need to work together to end the conflict in Syria, in particular, underscoring the need for Russia to rein in the Assad regime, Iran, and Iranian proxies. The President raised Ukraine, and expressed his Administration’s commitment to remain engaged in resolving the conflict and stressed Russia’s responsibility to fully implement the Minsk agreements.  He also raised the possibility of broader cooperation on resolving conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere. The President further emphasized his desire to build a better relationship between the United States and Russia.

	Trump Describes Meeting With Russia’s Foreign Minister, Ambassador as ‘Very, Very Good’

	Posted 10:52 AM, May 10, 2017

	President Donald Trump hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak at the White House Wednesday amid the swirling investigation of Russian contacts with Trump campaign and transition officials in 2016 and Tuesday’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was handling the probe.

	...The Russian Embassy tweeted a photo of Trump shaking the hand of Russia’s ambassador in what appears to be the Oval Office. Current and former US intelligence officials have accused Kislyak of being a top spy and recruiter of spies, a notion that Russian officials have dismissed.

	A White House statement after the meeting omitted any mention of Kislyak’s presence, instead focusing on Trump’s conversation with Lavrov, which the President described as “very, very good.”

	...According to the statement, Trump emphasized the need for the US and Russia to work together to end violence in Syria and Ukraine, floated the prospect of US-Russia cooperation on resolving Middle East conflicts and returned to a campaign theme by emphasizing his desire for better relations with Moscow.

	Lavrov denies election meddling

	Lavrov, who started off a news conference at the Russian Embassy by remarking that “relations between our countries … are not in the best condition,” also fielded several questions about Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 race to obvious irritation. “There is not a single fact (or) compelling evidence regarding Russia’s intervention,” he said.

	At another point, he mocked the idea, saying it must be “humiliating for the American people to realize the Russian Federation is controlling the situation in the United States.”

	...Alleged ties to Russia

	Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said Monday that she alerted the White House earlier this year that then-Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn could be “essentially blackmailed by the Russians.”

	Her testimony pushed the story of the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia back into the headlines.

	In an interview last week, Trump once again refused to blame Russia for attempting to influence the 2016 election through hacking and other means, despite an overwhelming consensus by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

	Trump and Putin also spoke by phone last week about the war in Syria for the first time since Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian government air base last month after an alleged chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime.

	The US missile strike angered Moscow and led Lavrov to declare that “it’s sad how damaging this is to the already bad relations between US and Russia.”

	...In 2009, under then-President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton famously presented Lavrov with a “reset” button to symbolically restart US-Russia relations. Unfortunately, instead of “reset” the Russian word on the button read “overcharged.”

	Diplomatically, Lavrov said he would keep the button on his desk. The attempt at a reset didn’t work

	Kremlin outfoxes White House over photos of Trump meeting with Russians

	...The widespread distribution of the Russian photos was a public relations coup for the Russians, who have been trying for several years to secure an Oval Office meeting for its foreign minister as a counterpoint to the strained relations between the two countries. Normally, such White House meetings are reserved for heads of state.

	Because of strained relations, it was Lavrov's first visit to the White House since 2013, despite lobbying efforts by the Russians, according to Politico, which reported that Trump agreed to receive him in the Oval Office at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

	The issue is particularly sensitive because of the presence at the meeting of Kislyak, who has been at the center of several controversies involving administration officials, including now fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Russian embassy even tweeted a photograph of Trump smiling broadly as he put his arm around the diplomat while shaking his hand in the Oval Office.

	The same day President Donald Trump was meeting with Russia’s foreign minister at the White House — and less than a day after firing former FBI director James Comey — the press pool captured Trump posing in the Oval Office with Henry Kissinger.

	According to the pool report, journalists had expected to find Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the president’s side, but instead was invited to an unannounced meeting with Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under Richard Nixon.

	Trump said he had met with Kissinger to talk “about Russia and various other matters.”

	...Trump added that Kissinger has “been a friend of mine for a long time.” Shortly after winning the 2016 presidential election, Trump met Kissinger in New York to discuss “events and issues around the world.”

	The press had not been permitted to witness the meeting with Lavrov, which was documented in handout photos provided by the Russian government.

	A CBS reporter caught Russian President Vladimir Putin at a hockey game in Sochi to ask for his reaction and whether Tuesday’s firing would affect the relationship between the two countries.

	“There will be no effect,” Putin said, with a translator at his side. “Your question looks very funny for me. Don’t be angry with me. We have nothing to do with that.”

	“President Trump is acting in accordance with his competence, in accordance with his law and Constitution,” he added.

	I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'
	5:29 AM - 11 Jun 2017 



The hunt for Donald Trump's tax returns continues. Grassley reveals that Comey is under scrutiny for the alleged FBI involvement with the "dirty dossier." Trump schedules a call with Putin.

Russian spy Julia Ioffe says the call is no big deal and "bleak" for Putin. During the call, Trump and Putin discuss Putin's "new ideas" for deeper cooperation in Syria and schedule a meeting for July. Putin asks Trump to meet Lavrov during his visit next week. Trump relies "yes."

Trump blasts Comey on twitter. At a hearing the next day, Comey struggles to find an excuse for his actions during the 2016 election. Spicer maintains that Trump has "confidence" in Comey, writing off Trump's tweets. Roger Stone gives a mysterious interview claiming communications with Trump and suggesting those communications were monitored.

Yates is scheduled to testify on her warnings about Flynn. Before the hearing, Trump points out on twitter that Obama also hired Flynn, and implies Yates is a leaker.

Trump downplays Yate's testimony, which reveals Yates believed Flynn was compromised and her warnings to the White House were urgent. Yates says that "if nothing was done" after the warnings it would be "concerning."

Clapper confirms that foreign allies passed the U.S. intelligence describing "suspicious contacts" between Trump advisors and Russian intelligence agents. Trump asserts that Clapper testified there is "no evidence" of collusion between Russia and Trump.

Yates testimony also reveals that Flynn was interviewed on White House grounds without a lawyer, that the White House knew Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI, that the White House asked DOJ about potential criminal proceedings and that the White House failed to notify the DOJ and other officials of Trump's travel ban, and strongly implies that the calls with the Russian ambassador were problematic and that Trump himself hid these from Pence, among other things (as previously mentioned).

The day of Yate's and Clapper's hearing, Rosenstein learns that Comey is to be fired. The next day, Rosenstein publishes a memo recommending Comey be fired for reasons that tend to criticize Comey for being too hard on Clinton. Trump had criticized Comey for going too easy on Clinton 6 days earlier. Trump cites the memo as the reason he fired Comey, saying he believes Rosenstein wrote it because of Comey's "poor performance before Congress." When asked later if he asked Rosenstein for a recommendation to fire Comey, Trump doesn't answer but says he was going to fire Comey anyway.

In Comey's termination letter, Trump stresses that Comey informed him "on three separate occasions" that he is not under investigation. Trump's lawyers assert there are no connections to Russia in the last 10 years of Trump's tax returns, except for some exceptions.

In an apparent attempt to intimidate him, Trump warns Comey that he "better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press." Trump continues to rant about leakers, accusing Comey of being a leaker and charging that he had long ago asked Comey to "find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community."

The day after firing Comey, Trump meets with Russian ambassadors Kislyak and Lavrov in the Oval Office. Apparently, Trump hoped to make deals for closer cooperation and warmer relations between the United States and Russia and, reportedly, Trump told Lavrov firing Comey had relieved "great pressure." Trump described the meeting as "very, very good."

However, following the meeting, Trump is besieged by a series of dramatic leaks, alleging his incompetence and deep, sordid ties to Russia. Trump wonders "when does it end?" 

Trump posits that Comey will leak more than anybody could possibly imagine, in such a way as to be potentially "totally illegal" but definitely "very cowardly."


Trump told Comey he wanted his "loyalty," expressed his hopes that Comey could "see his way to letting Flynn go," asked Comey to "lift the cloud" of the Russia investigation over his dealmaking before firing him. For the question of "what was Trump's intent?" behind these actions, Comey and Trump give very different interpretations.

Why did Trump fire Comey?

On Trump asking about Flynn:

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	BURR: Director, when the president requested that you, and I quote "Let Flynn go," General Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians, which is an offense, and if press accounts are right, there might have been discrepancies between facts and his FBI testimony. In your estimation, was general Flynn at that time in serious legal jeopardy, and in addition to that, do you sense that the president was trying to obstruct justice or just seek for a way for Mike Flynn to save face, given that he had already been fired?

	COMEY: General Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy. There was an open FBI criminal investigation of his statements in connection with the Russian contacts, and the contacts themselves, and so that was my assessment at the time. I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that's a conclusion I'm sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that's an offense. 


So Flynn in legal jeopardy, Trump at least should know, says "I hope you can let this go."

	CHAFFETZ: You did not look at testimony that Hillary Clinton gave in the United State Congress, both the House and the Senate.

	...Did you review and look at those transcripts as to the intent of your recommendation.

	COMEY: I’m sure my folks did. I did not.


	...DESJARLAIS: OK. Do you know if she asked her whether she stands by the fact she that said she just used one device and that was for her convenience?

	COMEY: I don’t know. I know they established, in talking to her, she used many devices during her four years. So I don’t know whether they asked her specifically about that statement. That’s easy to check, though.

	DESJARLAIS: OK. I guess my point is, you’re trying to get inside the head of Hillary Clinton in this investigation and know whether there was intent. And so we all know what she told the people. That has been well-documented.

	She said that she did not do those things, that she did not send or receive classified e-mails, that she used one server and one device for her convenience.

	And since then, I think even in your statement, you recognize that those were not correct. Is that fair?

	COMEY: I really don’t want to get in the business of trying to parse and judge her public statements. And so I think I’ve tried to avoid doing that sitting here.

	DESJARLAIS: Why do you feel that’s important?

	COMEY: Because what matters to me is what did she say to the FBI.

	SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, I just want you to know that I have great respect for you. Senator Cornyn and I sit on the judiciary committee and we have the occasion to have you before us. You're a man of strength and I regret the situations we all find ourselves in. I just want to say that. Let me begin with one overarching question. Why do you believe you were fired?

	COMEY: I guess I don't know for sure. I believe — I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didn't know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe he's saying something that's not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 








http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	COMEY: ...ignorance of the law is no excuse, but here’s the distinction. You have to have general criminal intent. You don’t need to know what particular statute you’re violating, but you must be aware of the generally wrongful nature of your conduct…


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	COMEY: In our system of law, there’s a thing called mens rea. It’s important to know what you did and when you did it. This Latin phrase “mens rea” means, “What were you thinking?”

	We don’t want to put people in jail unless we prove that they knew they were doing something they shouldn’t do.

	...At the time Congress passed that statute in 1917, there was a lot of concern in the House and Senate about whether that was going to violate the American tradition of requiring that before you go and lock somebody up, you proved they knew they were doing something wrong. So there was a lot of concern about it.


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: Now, here's the question, you're big. You're strong. I know the oval office, and I know what happens to people when they walk in. There is a certain amount of intimidation. But why didn't you stop and say, Mr. President, this is wrong. I cannot discuss this with you.

	COMEY: It's a great question. Maybe if I were stronger, I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took in. The only thing I could think to say, because I was playing in my mind -- because I could remember every word he said -- I was playing in my mind, what should my response be? That's why I carefully chose the words. Look, I've seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes. I remember saying, “I agree he is a good guy,” as a way of saying, I'm not agreeing with what you asked me to do. Again, maybe other people would be stronger in that circumstance. That's how Ed myself. I hope I'll never have another opportunity. Maybe if I did it again, I'd do it better. 

	...FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

	COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general. 

	...RUBIO: At the time, did you say something to the president about, that is not an appropriate request, or did you tell the white house counsel, it's not an appropriate request? Someone needs to tell the president he can't do these things.

	COMEY: I didn't, no.

	RUBIO: Why?

	COMEY: I don't know. I think -- as I said earlier, I think the circumstances were such that it was -- I was a bit stunned and didn't have the presence of mind. I don't know. I don't want to make you sound like I'm captain courageous. I don't know if I would have said to the president with the presence of mind, sir, that's wrong. In the moment, it didn't come to my mind. What came to my mind is be careful what you say. I said, I agree Flynn is a good guy. 




	...COLLINS: I'd like to now turn to the conversations with the president about Michael Flynn, which had been discussed at great length.

	First, let me make very clear that the president never should have cleared the room and he never should have asked you, as you reported, to let it go, to let the investigation go. But I remain puzzled by your response. Michael Flynn is a good guy. You could have said, Mr. President, this meeting is inappropriate. This response could compromise the investigation. You should not be making such a request. It's fundamental to the operation of our government, the FBI be insulated from this kind of political pressure. You talked a bit today about that you were stunned by the president making the request. But my question to you is later on, upon reflection, did you go to anyone at the department of justice and ask them to call the white house counsel's office and explain that the president had to have a far better understanding and appreciation of his role vis-à-vis the FBI?

	COMEY: In general, I did. I spoke to the attorney general and spoke to the new deputy attorney general, Mr. Rosenstein, when he took office and explained my serious concern about the way in which the president is interacting, especially with the FBI. As I said in my testimony, I told the attorney general, it can't happen that you get kicked out of the room and the president talks to me. Why didn't we raise the specific? It was of investigative interest to figure out, what just happened with the president's request? I wouldn't want to alert the white house it had happened until we figured out what we were going to do with it investigatively.

	COLLINS: Your testimony was that you went to attorney general sessions and said, don't ever leave me alone with him again. Are you saying that you also told him that he had made a request that you let it go with regard to part of the investigation of Michael Flynn?

	COMEY: No. I specifically did not. I did not. 


	...FEINSTEIN: You have the president of the United States asking you to stop an investigation that is an important investigation. What was the response of your colleagues?

	COMEY: I think they were as shocked and troubled by it as I was. Some said things that led me to believe that. I don't remember exactly. But the reaction was similar to mine. They're all experienced people who never experienced such a thing, so they were very concerned. Then the conversation turned to about, so what should we do with this information? That was a struggle for us. Because we are the leaders of the FBI, so it's been reported to us, and I heard it and now shared it with the leaders of the FBI, our conversation was, should we share this with any senior officials at the justice department? Our primary concern was, we can't infect the investigative team. We don't want the agents and analysts working on this to know the president of the united States has asked, and when it comes from the president, I took it as a direction, to get rid of this investigation because we're not going to follow that request. So we decided, we have to keep it away from our troops.

	Is there anyone else we ought to tell at the justice department? We considered whether to tell -- the attorney general said we believe rightly he was shortly going to recuse. There was no other senate confirmed leaders in the justice department at that point. The deputy attorney general was Mr. Boente, acting shortly in the seat. We decided the best move would be to hold it, keep it in a box, document it, as we'd already done, and this investigation is going to do on. Figure out what to do with it down the road. Is there a way to corroborate it? It was our word against the president's. No way to corroborate this. My view of this changed when the prospect of tapes was raised. That's how we thought about it then.

	Republicans are also more likely than Democrats to say Clinton's email use is a major problem, 85 percent to 22 percent. But 49 percent of Democrats say it's a minor problem, while just 29 percent don't think it's a problem at all.

...

probably: discredit/politicize USIC
ruin USIC capabilities
politicize/cast doubt on Russian methods


I guess it does make sense to:

politicize CIA/narrative of Russian intervention as much as possible so that Repulicans, who typically like CIA/hate Russia, are reversed

utterly destroy the narrative and USIC by reveailing Russia narrative to be fake (dossier, intel leak thing, maybe hacking, others?) and USIC top levels to be corrupt and scheming

Republicans continue to hate CIA distrust Russia narratives

liberals confused, defeated, maybe feel betrayed by USIC 

key is that Republicans tend to be more bullheaded, so this wouldn't work as well the other way around

would likely rely, in their view, on liberals soul searching and tears to finish off themselves

fuck I'm cold

this has gotten to my head lol

but best case scenario for them is both Republicans and Democrats end up distrusting USIC


Politicizing any idea, event, institution, person, thing, etc. makes it easier for propagandists to control public perception around said thing.

Trump asking Comey to stay:

Trump might know Comey is known to threaten to quit? And that this causes problems...

Trump also says his advisors told him good things about Comey iirc?

And Trump got a "favor" from Comey, at least in his view

Comey wants people to think Trump is dirty:



http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	WARNER: ...Now you've had extensive experience at the department of justice and at the FBI. You've worked under presidents of both parties. What was about that meeting that led you to determine that you needed to start putting down a written record?

	COMEY: A combination of things. I think the circumstances, the subject matter, and the person I was interacting with. Circumstances, first, I was alone with the president of the United States, or the president-elect, soon to be president. The subject matter I was talking about matters that touch on the FBI's core responsibility, and that relate to the president, president-elect personally, and then the nature of the person. I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I thought it important to document. 




	WARNER: ...you should be prepared to assure then President-elect Trump that the FBI was not investigating him personally. Now, I understand that your leadership team, agreed with that but was that a unanimous decision? Was there any debate about that?

	COMEY: Wasn't unanimous. One of the members of the leadership team had a view you that although it was technically true we did not have a counter-intelligence file case open on then President-elect Trump. His concern was because we're looking at the potential, again, that's the subject of the investigation, coordination between the campaign and Russia, because it was President Trump, President-elect Trump's campaign, this person's view was inevitably his behavior, his conduct will fall within the scope of that work. And so he was reluctant to make the statement. I disagreed. I thought it was fair to say what was literally true. There was not a counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump, and I decided in the moment to say it, given the nature of our conversation.

	WARNER: At that moment in time, did you ever revisit that as in the subsequent sessions?

	COMEY: With the FBI leadership team? Sure. And the leader had that view that didn't change. His view was still that it was probably although literally true, his concern was it could be misleading, because the nature of the investigation was such that it might well touch, obviously it would touch, the campaign, and the person that headed the campaign would be the candidate, and so that was his view throughout. 



	WARNER: ...What was your impression, and what did you mean by this notion of a patronage relationship?

	COMEY: Well, my impression, and again it's my impression, I could always be wrong but my common sense told me what was going on is, either he had concluded or someone had told him that you didn't, you've already asked Comey to stay, and you didn't get anything for it.

	And that the dinner was an effort to build a relationship, in fact, he asked specifically, of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay. As I said, what was odd about that is we'd already talked twice about it by that point and he said I very much hope you'll stay. In fact, I just remembered sitting a third, when you've seen the. IC tour of me walking across the blue room, and what the president whispered in my ear was "I really look forward to working with you." So after those encounters -- 

	WARNER: That was a few days before your firing.

	COMEY: On the Sunday after the inauguration. The next Friday I have dinner and the president begins by wanting to talk about my job and so I'm sitting there thinking wait a minute three times we've already, you've already asked me to stay or talked about me staying. My common sense, again I could be wrong but my common sense told me what's going on here is, he's looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job.

Comey interprets Trump saying he was fired because of the Russia investigation:

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, I just want you to know that I have great respect for you. Senator Cornyn and I sit on the judiciary committee and we have the occasion to have you before us. You're a man of strength and I regret the situations we all find ourselves in. I just want to say that. Let me begin with one overarching question. Why do you believe you were fired?

	COMEY: I guess I don't know for sure. I believe — I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didn't know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe he's saying something that's not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 

	...FEINSTEIN: Do you believe the Russia investigation played a role?

	COMEY: In why I was fired?

	FEINSTEIN: Yes.

	COMEY: Yes. I've seen the president say so. 



	WYDEN: How would you characterize Attorney General Sessions's adherence to his recusal? In particular, with regard to his involvement in your firing, which the president has acknowledged was because of the Russian investigation.

	COMEY: That's a question I can't answer. I think it is a reasonable question. If, as the president said, I was fired because of the Russia investigation, why was the attorney general involved in that chain? I don't know. So I don't have an answer for the question. 



	HEINRICH: Fair enough. Told the reporter he never did that. You've testified that the president asked for your loyalty in that dinner. White house denies that. A lot of this comes down to who should we believe. Do you want to say anything as to why we should believe you?

	COMEY: My mother raised me not to say things like this about myself so I'm not going to. I think people should look at the whole body of my testimony. As I used to say to juries, when I talked about a witness, you can't cherry pick it. You can't say, I like these things he said but on this, he's a ten liar. You have to take it together.

Comey interprets Trump's comments as asking him to fire Flynn:



http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: Let's go to the Flynn issue. The senator outlined, “I hope you could see your way to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” But you also said in your written remarks, and I quote, that you “had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December,”. Please go into that with more detail.

	COMEY: Well, the context and the president's word are what led me to that conclusion. As I said in my statement, I could be wrong, but Flynn had been forced to resign the day before. And the controversy around general Flynn at that point in time was centered on whether he lied to the vice president about his nature of conversations with the Russians, whether he had been candid with others in the course of that. So that happens on the day before. On the 1, the president makes reference to that. I understood what he wanted me to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynn's account of his conversations with the Russians. 


	RUBIO: And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia investigation, he was asking specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself?

	COMEY: That's how I understood it. Yes, sir. 

	RUBIO: As you perceived it, while he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given the setting, the position and some of the circumstances?

	COMEY: Yes. 



	RUBIO: The president's wishes were known to them, certainly by the next day when he had a press conference with the prime minister. Going back, the three requests were, number one, be loyal. Number two, let the Mike Flynn thing go. He is a good guy, been treated unfairly. Number three, can you please tell the American people what these leaders in congress already know, which you already know and what you told me three times, that I'm not under personally under investigation.

	COMEY: That's right. 



	WYDEN: Your testimony was that the president's request about Flynn could infect investigation. Had the president got what he wanted and what he asked of you, what would have been the effect on the investigation?

	COMEY: We would have closed any investigation of general Flynn in connection with his statements and encounters -- statements about encounters with Russians in the late part of December. We would have dropped an open criminal investigation.

Comey excuses for not correcting Trump:


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: Now, here's the question, you're big. You're strong. I know the oval office, and I know what happens to people when they walk in. There is a certain amount of intimidation. But why didn't you stop and say, Mr. President, this is wrong. I cannot discuss this with you.

	COMEY: It's a great question. Maybe if I were stronger, I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took in. The only thing I could think to say, because I was playing in my mind -- because I could remember every word he said -- I was playing in my mind, what should my response be? That's why I carefully chose the words. Look, I've seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes. I remember saying, “I agree he is a good guy,” as a way of saying, I'm not agreeing with what you asked me to do. Again, maybe other people would be stronger in that circumstance. That's how Ed myself. I hope I'll never have another opportunity. Maybe if I did it again, I'd do it better. 




	FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

	COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general. 


Or Comey could tell him that's innapropriate...


	RUBIO: At the time, did you say something to the president about, that is not an appropriate request, or did you tell the white house counsel, it's not an appropriate request? Someone needs to tell the president he can't do these things.

	COMEY: I didn't, no.

	RUBIO: Why?

	COMEY: I don't know. I think -- as I said earlier, I think the circumstances were such that it was -- I was a bit stunned and didn't have the presence of mind. I don't know. I don't want to make you sound like I'm captain courageous. I don't know if I would have said to the president with the presence of mind, sir, that's wrong. In the moment, it didn't come to my mind. What came to my mind is be careful what you say. I said, I agree Flynn is a good guy. 



	COLLINS: I'd like to now turn to the conversations with the president about Michael Flynn, which had been discussed at great length.

	First, let me make very clear that the president never should have cleared the room and he never should have asked you, as you reported, to let it go, to let the investigation go. But I remain puzzled by your response. Michael Flynn is a good guy. You could have said, Mr. President, this meeting is inappropriate. This response could compromise the investigation. You should not be making such a request. It's fundamental to the operation of our government, the FBI be insulated from this kind of political pressure. You talked a bit today about that you were stunned by the president making the request. But my question to you is later on, upon reflection, did you go to anyone at the department of justice and ask them to call the white house counsel's office and explain that the president had to have a far better understanding and appreciation of his role vis-à-vis the FBI?

	COMEY: In general, I did. I spoke to the attorney general and spoke to the new deputy attorney general, Mr. Rosenstein, when he took office and explained my serious concern about the way in which the president is interacting, especially with the FBI. As I said in my testimony, I told the attorney general, it can't happen that you get kicked out of the room and the president talks to me. Why didn't we raise the specific? It was of investigative interest to figure out, what just happened with the president's request? I wouldn't want to alert the white house it had happened until we figured out what we were going to do with it investigatively.

	COLLINS: Your testimony was that you went to attorney general sessions and said, don't ever leave me alone with him again. Are you saying that you also told him that he had made a request that you let it go with regard to part of the investigation of Michael Flynn?

	COMEY: No. I specifically did not. I did not.

what is cloud



FEINSTEIN: You describe two phone calls that you received from president trump. One on March 30th and one on April 11. He, quote, described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability, end quote, as president, and asked you, quote, to lift the cloud, end quote. How did you interpret that? What did you believe he wanted you to do?

COMEY: I interpreted that as he was frustrated that the Russia investigation was taking up so much time and energy. I think he meant of the executive branch, but in the public square in general. It was making it difficult for him to focus on other priorities of his. But what he asked me was actually narrowing than that. I think what he meant by the cloud — and, again, I could be wrong — but the entire investigation is taking up oxygen and making it hard for me to focus on what I want to focus on. The ask was to get it out that I, the president, am not personally under investigation.

FEINSTEIN: After April 11th, did he ask you more ever about the Russia investigation? Did he ask you any questions?

COMEY: We never spoke again after April 11th.

FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general.

FEINSTEIN: So I want to go into that. Who did you talk with about that, lifting the cloud, stop the investigation back at the FBI, and what was their response?

COMEY: The FBI, during one of the two conversations — I'm not remembering exactly — I think the first, my chief of staff was sitting in front of me and heard my end of the conversation because the president's call was a surprise. I discussed the lifting the cloud and the request with the senior leadership team who, typically, and I think in all the circumstances, was the deputy director, my chief of staff, the general counsel, the deputy director's chief counsel and, I think in a number of circumstances, the number three in the FBI and a few of the conversations included the head of the national security branch. The group of us that lead the FBI when it comes to national security.

FEINSTEIN: You have the president of the United States asking you to stop an investigation that is an important investigation. What was the response of your colleagues?

COMEY: I think they were as shocked and troubled by it as I was. Some said things that led me to believe that. I don't remember exactly. But the reaction was similar to mine. They're all experienced people who never experienced such a thing, so they were very concerned. Then the conversation turned to about, so what should we do with this information? That was a struggle for us. Because we are the leaders of the FBI, so it's been reported to us, and I heard it and now shared it with the leaders of the FBI, our conversation was, should we share this with any senior officials at the justice department? Our primary concern was, we can't infect the investigative team. We don't want the agents and analysts working on this to know the president of the united States has asked, and when it comes from the president, I took it as a direction, to get rid of this investigation because we're not going to follow that request. So we decided, we have to keep it away from our troops.

Is there anyone else we ought to tell at the justice department? We considered whether to tell -- the attorney general said we believe rightly he was shortly going to recuse. There was no other senate confirmed leaders in the justice department at that point. The deputy attorney general was Mr. Boente, acting shortly in the seat. We decided the best move would be to hold it, keep it in a box, document it, as we'd already done, and this investigation is going to do on. Figure out what to do with it down the road. Is there a way to corroborate it? It was our word against the president's. No way to corroborate this. My view of this changed when the prospect of tapes was raised. That's how we thought about it then.

FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


So did Comey interpret the request as asking to get out that he was not under investigation? or "chill" the invetigation? or to "get it out there" and clear the air?



http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295

	RUBIO: Are those the only two instances in which that back and forth happened, where the president was basically saying, and I'm paraphrasing here, it's okay. Do the Russia investigation. I hope it all comes out. I have nothing to do with anything Russia. It'd be great if it all came out, people around me were doing things that were wrong?

	COMEY: Yes. As I recorded it accurately there. That was the sentiment he was expressing. Yes, sir.

fucking over the president


http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
	The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.

	The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI’s counter-intelligence responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect. Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBI’s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct. 




http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	COLLINS: Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence invest -- investigations, or were you talking about any FBI investigation?

	COMEY: I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true. My reading of it was it was important for me to assure him we were not person investigating him. So the context then was actually narrower, focused on what I just talked to him about. It was very important because it was, first, true, and second, I was worried very much about being in kind of a Jay Hoover type situation. I didn't want him thinking I was briefing him on this to sort of hang it over him in some way. I was briefing him on it because, because we had been told by the media it was about to launch. We didn't want to be keeping that from him. He needed to know this was being said. I was very keen not to leave him with an impression that the bureau was trying to do something to him. So that's the context in which I said, sir, we're not personally investigating you. 





	RUBIO: What he was asking you to do, would you have done here today?

	COMEY: Correct. Yes, sir. 



	COLLINS: Then on the January 27th dinner, you told the president that he should be careful about asking you to investigate because, “you might create a narrative that we are investigating him personally, which we weren't.” Again, were you limiting that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or more broadly, such as a criminal investigation?

	COMEY: I didn't modify the word investigation. It was, again, he was reacting strongly against the unverified material, saying I'm tempted to order you to investigate it. In the context of that, I said, sir, be careful about it. I might create a narrative we're investigating you personally. 



So Comey created perception that Trump was under investigation, says he would clear him, says "careful if we do anything about it we will create a narrative we're investigating you," then never bothers to actually do it, or really just shoot down the stupid dossier which is what he should have done all along anyway




So Comey is saying he needed to brief Trump on this because it was about to leak and he should know, and that he might be compromised.

But why conclude that? the dossier is sketchy

Comey docs mayb inadmissible:


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	BLUNT: So you didn't consider your memo or your sense of that conversation to be a government document. You considered it to be, somehow, your own personal document that you could share to the media as you wanted through a friend?

	COMEY: Correct. I understood this to be my recollection recorded of my conversation with the president. As a private citizen, I thought it important to get it out.

	BLUNT: Were all your memos that you recorded on classified or other ds memos that might be yours as a private citizen?

	COMEY: I'm not following the question.

	BLUNT: You said you used classified --

	COMEY: Not the classified documents. Unclassified. I don't have any of them anymore. I gave them to the special counsel. My view was that the content of those unclassified, memorialization of those conversations was my recollection recorded. 


	KING: With regard to your memos, isn't it true that in a court case when you're weighing evidence, contemporaneous memos and contemporaneous statements to third parties are considered probative in terms of the validity of testimony?

	COMEY: Yes.

	KING: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

	COMEY: I don't want to say.

	KING: ...I think it was on January 6, when yourself, Admiral Rogers, Director Brennan, and General Clapper went to Trump tower to meet with President Trump. The media reports are that at the end of that meeting, Director Comey, you presented president-elect Trump with a copy of the now infamous or famous dossier. And I don't know how many people were in the room, but within hours, that was leaked to the media and that gave the media the excuse or the rationale to publish almost the entire dossier.

	Do you -- does that violate any law? I mean you were at a classified briefing with the president-elect of the United States and it had to be a very, very small universe of people who knew that you handed them that dossier and it was leaked out within hours. Are you making any effort to find out who leaked it and do you believe that constitute a criminal violation?

	Over the summer, as Trump prepared to accept the Republican presidential nomination, Millian traveled to Russia. He posted pictures on his Facebook page showing that he attended a ­Russian government-sponsored summit in St. Petersburg in June. One photograph shows him with Russia’s minister for energy. Another shows him chatting with Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, who is close to Putin. A spokeswoman for Deripaska declined to comment. A spokesman for the Russian Embassy did not respond to questions about Millian.

	Later in the summer, Millian continued boasting of his Trump connections.

	He told ABC News that he had been the “official broker” for the Trump-branded condo building and described Trump’s affinity for working with Russians. He pointed to “hundreds of millions of dollars that [Trump] received from interactions with Russian businessmen.”

	Millian added that Trump “likes Russia because he likes beautiful Russian ladies — talking to them, of course. And he likes to be able to make lots of money with Russians.”

	Millian told ABC that he was “absolutely not” involved with Russian intelligence. But when asked whether he had heard rumors to that effect, Millian replied, “Yes, of course.”

	HARRIS: Has anything you’ve learned in the months since your February 14th meeting changed your understanding of the president’s request? I guess it would be what he has said in public documents or public interviews?

	COMEY: Correct.

Several potentially relevant events lead up to the puzzling January 27th dinner between Trump and Comey:

- Trump has blamed the leak of the dossier on the IC, and appears to think U.S. intelligence agencies are leaking information on the Russia investigation out of hostility toward him.

- The Trump administration denied coordinating Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador and claimed they were innocuous, but the circumstances surrounding the calls hint at criminality or wrongdoing by Trump.

- Comey assured Trump he was not under investigation and refused to confirm the Russia investigation, and Trump has acted friendly toward Comey after others called for his resignation.

- According to Comey, Trump had asked Comey to stay on during the January 6th briefing, before the calls for Comey to resign. Comey also assured Trump he was not under investigation during this briefing, but this was before the "secret CIA assessment" and media reports on potential misconducted surrounding Flynn's contacts with the Russians.

- Meanwhile, Trump has been briefed that Wikileaks is affiliated with Russian intelligence, and Wikileaks has threatened to release Trump's tax returns.

In this context, Trump learns the following in the week leading up to the dinner:

- Carol Lee, Devlin Barrett, and Shane Harris of The Wall Street Journal report on Jan 22 that multiple U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador.

- Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller of The Washington Post report on Jan 23 that the FBI found no wronging and Flynn is not under investigation.

- Matt Zapotosky, Ellen Nakashima, and Greg Miller of The Washington Post and Adam Goldman of the NY Times report on Jan 24 that Trump intends to keep Comey as FBI Director.

Speaking later of the Jan 27th dinner, Trump tells Lester Holt that Comey had "wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on," contradicting these reports. But Comey later testified that he never asked Trump to meet for dinner.

Trump will also claim he was "surprised" by Yates warnings about Flynn, as he "read various articles" saying Flynn "was just doing his job," indicating an awareness of the Jan 23 Washington Post report (the source for the "Flynn cleared of wrongdoing" story). Trump is also aware of the Jan 22 Wall Street Journal report--the WaPo report references it and the White House had commented on it. It is unclear if Trump was aware of the Jan 23rd CNN report independently corroborating the Jan 22 WSJ report.

Did Trump honestly believe the WaPo report over the WSJ report that Flynn "did nothing wrong?" It is hard to believe--Trump has said the Wall Street Journal and "financial media" are "much better, much more honest" than "the political media," and the Trump campaign had previously revoked The Washington Post's press credentials for "incredibly inaccurate coverage." On top of this, Flynn was interviewed by the FBI at the White House on the 24th  (and so adding FBI agents to the WH visitor logs) and on the 26th, Yates told the White House that Flynn was under investigation and the DOJ had evidence of misconduct.

After learning about FLynn's conduct, it looks like Trump was worried about a criminal investigation: on the 27th, McGahn came back to the DOJ with requests to see the underlying evidence and to discuss "the applicability of certain criminal statues" and "the likelihood that the Department of Justice would pursue a criminal case." In particular, it looks like Trump was worried about a criminal investigation of himself: 



at their Jan 26th meeting, Yates tells White House counsel Don McGahn that Flynn was interviewed by the FBI, and McGahn asks "how'd he do?" Yates doesn't answer, but McGahn comes back the afternoon of the 27th 




Trump will echo this claim that Flynn did nothing wrong, despite Yate's warning to the White House, Flynn being interviewed by the FBI on White House grounds , and the Wall Street Journal and other outlets reporting that Flynn is under investigation.




It's Trump truly believed the Washington Post report of the Wall Street Joural


It's interesting that Trump claims to believe the Washington Post over the Wall Street Journal--Actually,

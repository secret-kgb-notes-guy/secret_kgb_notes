	“No, it’s not the Muslim ban,” the president told ABC's David Muir during an interview that aired Wednesday night, while reiterating the need to restrict access into the U.S. in some form.

	“You’re looking at people that come in in many cases with evil intentions. I don’t want that. They’re ISIS. They’re coming in under false pretense. I don’t want that," he added.

	YATES: We told him ... the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others, because in the media accounts, it was clear from the vice president and others that they were repeating what General Flynn had told them, and that this was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information.

	And that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.

	...we were there to tell the White House about something we were very concerned about and emphasized to them repeatedly. It was so they could take action.

	"I’ll tell you the whole history of it: When he first announced it, he said ‘Muslim ban,'" Giuliani said on Fox News.

	"He called me up, he said, ‘Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.’"

	Giuliani said he then put together a commission that included lawmakers and expert lawyers.

	"And what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger," Giuliani said.

	"The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible."

	Giuliani reiterated that the ban is "not based on religion."

	"It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country," he said.

	Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or its surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order's purpose.

	...I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.

	YATES: ...we would have to argue that the executive order had nothing to do with religion, that it was not done with an intent to discriminate against Muslims. And based on a variety of factors...

	KENNEDY: And you were looking at intent?

	YATES: Yes, and I believe that that's the appropriate analysis. And in fact, that's been borne out in several court decisions since that time, that that's the appropriate analysis when you're doing a constitutional analysis is to look to see what are you trying to accomplish here?

	LEAHY: The White House claimed that you betrayed the Department of Justice? Do you feel you betrayed the Department of Justice?

	YATES: No, Senator, I feel to have done anything else would have been a betrayal of my solemn obligation to represent the people and to uphold the law and the Constitution.

	A federal judge in Detroit ordered the Trump administration to turn over the memo by May 19, according to reports. The ACLU said Saturday that Trump did not meet the deadline on Friday.



We need to know if Trump or his associates intended to create an excuse to fire acting AG Yates. What are they trying to hide?

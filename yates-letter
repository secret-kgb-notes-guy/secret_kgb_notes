Yates warned the White House that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail. The Jusitce Department tried to block Yates from testifying about this, backed-off when they realized they didn't have an argument, and referred Yates to the White House just in time for Nunes to cancel her hearing.

The National Security Advisor gave a Russian spy enough blackmail on him to end his career, then lied to the FBI about it. This could be a disaster for national security, and the White House knew it. Why is the Trump Administration trying to cover this up? The Government is supposed to protect us, not cover for foreign agents.

Racism against Mexican immigrants:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/

    When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

    My Mexican girlfriend just broke up with me for supporting Trump.

    Been slowly trying to red pill her lately. She's been reluctant to look too far into evidence for fear of any of it being true. Tonight it reached a breaking point and she started crying. Her father is an illegal immigrant so it's a touchy subject. She said she couldn't be with someone who didn't understand why Trump is so scary.

    My fellow centipedes, as a former Bernie supporter it's been a long journey to realize the truth. We need to MAGA and #DrainTheSwamp for the sake of our country, children around the world, and my relationship.

http://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2017/01/10/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-mark-kramer

    In later years, the KGB tried to stir up racial tensions in New York City by sending inflammatory forged publications to black activist groups and by setting off a bomb in a “Negro section of New York” and blaming it on the militant Jewish Defense League. Service A resorted to similar provocations throughout the 1970s and well into the 1980s, viewing race relations as the issue most likely to destabilize the U.S. political system.

    1. Cover with ridicule all of the valid traditions in your opponent's country.

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5rjx37/showerthought_the_left_will_immediately_disregard/

    Showerthought: The left will immediately disregard the Constitution as archaic and irrelevant when discussing the second amendment...But when the topic is a temporary ban on refugees from terror hotspots, America's founding principles suddenly become sacred again.

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5qu3ae/give_me_your_tired_your_poor_your_huddled_masses/

    Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Allahu Akbar. I kill you infidel dogs in the street. Ban these cucks.

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5jkyy0/has_anyone_else_noticed_liberals_love_to_quote/

    Has anyone else noticed liberals love to quote that line "Give me your tired, your poor" when trying to justify bringing in a bunch of 3rd world muslims?

    They always seem to leave out the rest of the quote about yearning to be free, since shariah is the fucking opposite of that.

    Obama: Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Muslims

 

    2. Implicate their leaders in criminal affairs and turn them over to the scorn of their populace at the right time;

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u2jkz/til_this_was_the_top_post_on_rpizzagate_when_the/ddxazrp/

    So I suspect something like that is going on with pizza-gate. Pure bullshit designed to amplify and drag more people into a real sex scandal that Russia can use as blackmail.

http://time.com/4425876/julian-assange-dnc-email-democratic-convention/

    WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange foreshadowed the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails more than a month before the archive of emails was published ahead of the Democratic National Convention.

    Assange's comments in a June 12 interview with ITV made it clear that he intended to harm Hillary Clinton's chance of winning the presidency, and timed the release of the emails to coincide with the start of the convention, an interview first highlighted by the New York Times.

 

    3. Disrupt the work of their government by every means;

http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/02/02/ask-neil-gorsuch-about-merrick-garland/hB1lMt89367mAGjDIgJ7sM/story.html

    President Trump’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch gives Senate Democrats an opportunity to put a difficult question to the nominee: Does he believe that Senate Republicans acted constitutionally and properly in preventing President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, from receiving a hearing or an up and down vote? Gorsuch will try desperately to avoid answering that embarrassing question. ...Asking and re-asking that embarrassing question during Gorsuch’s confirmation hearings would make good theater.

    Hostile propaganda against the EU and its member states seeks to distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyse the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens, says the text.

 

    4. Do not shun the aid of the lowest and most despicable individuals of your enemy's country.

    5. Spread disunity and dispute among the citizens.

    An Initial Set of Sites That Reliably Echo Russian Propaganda

    ...amren.com ... countercurrents.org ...

https://www.amren.com/features/2017/01/russia-deals-immigrants/

    Americans have something to learn.

    White people in the former Warsaw Pact countries still cherish their racial and cultural identities, and their politicians and citizens are trying to keep immigrants out. Even if we in America and Western Europe become extensions of the Third World, the countries behind the Iron Curtain will still be European.

http://www.countercurrents.org/

    A majority of last week’s raids were conducted near or around homes, in the early hours of the morning. Immigrant advocacy groups report ICE agents posing as other branches of law enforcement and arresting immigrants heading out to work.

http://www.countercurrents.org/2017/01/30/trump-defies-mass-protests-against-anti-immigrant-measures/

    The enactment of Trump’s measures lays the basis for police state conditions of rule in the United States. The prospect of mass internment centers for processing hundreds of thousands or millions of immigrants is not a distant possibility, but an imminent threat.

 

    6. Turn the young against the old.

http://www.countercurrents.org/mickeyz040315.htm

    The men that devised and carried out the abhorrent attack described above are widely considered to be part of this country’s “greatest generation.” By any rational definition, these men are terrorists.

    Never forget, comrades: This is what we're up against

http://www.countercurrents.org/eriqat060908.htm

    What these vitriolic comments reveal is a “gimme” mentality, especially among baby boomers who have enjoyed a comfortable and coddled existence. They want convenient cradle-to-grave care from the government: subsidized housing and transportation, low-cost education and gold-plated health care, the consequences be damned, as long as the costs are dumped on somebody else. Is it any great surprise, now that the baby boomers are facing retirement and more frequent health issues, that they are so universally in favor of these rich entitlements?

 

    7. Be generous with promises and rewards to collaborators and accomplices.

https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-15/washington-insiders-reap-windfall-peddling-influence-for-kremlin

    The Kremlin and Big Oil are stuffing more money into Washington’s influence machine as Europe and the U.S. renew their commitment to Russian sanctions.

    While Russia may be angry about international sanctions over the Ukraine conflict, Beltway lawyers are mopping up and big names in lobbying are piling in.

    ...the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott raked in $300,000 from Kremlin-controlled OAO Gazprombank, which was a target of sanctions. The Gazprombank billings for Lott’s firm are about double what Lott made in annual salary during any of his 18 years in the Senate.

    ...What’s driving this is no mystery. While the West expresses displeasure at President Vladimir Putin’s deadly Ukraine adventuring and the human toll it is taking, other things are at stake -- notably billions of dollars of investments on both sides of the Atlantic in Russia’s energy and finance sectors.

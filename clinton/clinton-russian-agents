	 "Several were getting close to high-ranking officials," he said. One had gone to work for a confidant of a U.S. Cabinet member, he added, declining to offer details.

	One of the Russians, who identified herself as Cynthia Murphy of Montclair, N.J., provided financial planning for Alan Patricof, a New York venture capitalist and top Democratic donor who was finance chairman of Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, according to news reports.

	Clinton friend was spy's target

	A leading Democratic fundraiser and close political ally of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was been a target of the alleged ring of Russian spies arrested yesterday by federal authorities.

	The president of the high-end tax accounting and financial advising firm Morea Financial Services confirmed earlier today that the alleged spy "Cynthia Murphy" was a longtime employee and a vice president at the company, which is located on lower Broadway in Manhattan. Federal and state campaign finance filings suggest that the little-known company manages the finances of one of New York's top Democratic financiers: Alan Patricof, a venture capital figure and the finance chairman of Clinton's Senate campaign, as well as a top presidential campaign fundraiser.

	According to the federal complaint, Murphy had "several work-related personal meetings" with a person it describes as "a prominent New York-based financier," and says she and her husband and alleged co-conspirator accurately reported back to Moscow that the financier was "prominent in politics" and "an active fundraiser for" a major political party, as well as "a personal friend" of a current Cabinet secretary, and in a position to provide information about foreign policy.

	Murphy, the complaint says, was assigned this person's account.

	Several Democrats said Wednesday that they hoped any bitter feelings about the rivalry could be put aside, and the party could move forward.

	“It just settles an issue that, while it was outstanding and ambiguous, created a cloud of uncertainty,” said Alan Patricof, a venture capitalist who is a donor to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “I think now that it is clarified, it makes everything that much more clear.”

	The former President Clinton did not give a speech and stayed largely in the background at the breakfast event, hosted by New York venture capitalist Alan Patricof and his wife, Susan, both longtime Clinton friends. But Samantha Ettus, a Los Angeles-based author and radio host who attended the fundraiser with her husband and children, said donors and their kids had remarkable access to the Clintons, unlike at other events “where you spot a celebrity or politician” but never get to talk to them.

	HILL’S SOUR GRAPES
	By Maggie Haberman

	 “I think the two of them together would beat John McCain,” said one Clinton insider, adding that with Biden: “In a week, we’re not going to be talking about his pick, he’s going to be right back where he was (in the polls).”

	“I can’t give you an answer, I don’t think anybody else can,” said longtime Clinton friend and donor Alan Patricof.

	“I frankly can’t understand why, and I assume he must have some reasons that are unknown to me, but he’s thought all the issues out and weighed all the factors … and decided (someone else) is the best.”

	Hillary Clinton donor back in the fundraising mix

	(CNN) - After Hillary Clinton lost the 2008 primary to President Barack Obama, Alan Patricof, a wealthy financier who had helped raise sizable donations to the Clinton campaign, took a step back from politics.

	...Attendees to the Tuesday night fundraiser paid the maximum allowable campaign donation for an individual under current campaign laws: $32,400 per person.

	...Patricof has been a longtime supporter of Clinton. In 2008, he was part of a loyal group of fundraisers – called the "Hillraisers" – who donated and bundled millions of dollars for the then-senator's White House bid.

	When asked by CNN earlier this year if he would look to bundle and fundraise for Clinton in 2016 – should she run – he said, "Yes, I can say that with certainty."

	"I remain a Clinton supporter," Patricof said. "I definitely am very supportive of Hillary should she decide to go forward."

	In the invitation to the Obama fundraiser, Patricof acknowledged his "various efforts to convince Hillary to run in 2016 and to demonstrate financial, as well as moral support, if she decides to go forward."


"convinced Hillary to run?"


hmmm

	Longtime Hillary Clinton friend and fundraiser Alan Patricof says that major Democratic donors are "tripping over themselves" to donate to the former secretary of State.

	Appearing on "Bloomberg Surveillance" on Friday, Patricof was asked if "all of the deep Democratic pockets" are still behind Clinton. 

	"Based on the number of calls I get on a daily basis, I’d say people are tripping over themselves. That’s why you have the formation of this organization called Ready for Hillary," Patricof said.

	As U.S. Vice President Joe Biden considers jumping into the 2016 White House race, the Democratic donor class appears relatively united in its support of front-runner Hillary Clinton.

	"I like Joe Biden very much, but it's time to line up for Hillary and we are lining up," said Karin Birkeland, a top Democratic bundler for President Barack Obama in 2012 who recently committed to Clinton. "She has by far the best resume, she's ready, she's younger and she's a woman."

	Another Democratic bundler who raised $500,000 for Obama in 2012 and who recently decided on Clinton, was blunter. "Joe Biden's ship has passed," said the donor, who asked not be named due to his respect for the vice president. 


	...But while all of those interviewed by Reuters expressed respect for Biden, and said they felt deeply empathetic about the recent loss of his son Beau, 46, to brain cancer, none indicated that a Biden run would cause them to switch allegiances. What's more, Biden has never been a politician known for his fundraising prowess - and many experts predicted he would struggle at this late stage to build, virtually from scratch, a fundraising machine, especially since Clinton has had so much of the money locked up since last winter.

	In ways both subtle and blunt, Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign is sending a message to Vice President Joe Biden about his potential presidential campaign: This won't be easy.

	...Donors who have publicly expressed support for a Biden run have later been contacted by the Clinton team, according to fundraisers and Democratic strategists who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private conversations. Even Clinton herself has made a few calls, they said, to express her disappointment in the defector.

	We were becoming very concerned they were getting close enough to a sitting U.S. cabinet member that we thought we could no longer allow this to continue,” FBI counter-intelligence head Frank Figliuzzi told the BBC in an interview.

	Department of Justice officials told ABC News one of the arrested Russian agents that Figliuzzi referred to was Cynthia Murphy.

	According to court documents about the spies’ arrest, Murphy was in contact with a fundraiser and “personal friend” of Hillary Clinton. The fundraiser, Alan Patricof, said in a 2010 statement that he had kept Murphy’s financial services firm more than two years prior and had met with her several times, as well as communicated with her on the phone on a frequent basis. Patricof insisted they “never” spoke about politics, the government or world events.


Patricof himself a spy? and if so since when?

did emigrate from Russia I think?

	A spokesperson for Clinton told ABC News in 2010 that at the time there was “no reason to think the Secretary was a target of this spy ring.”

	One of Washington's most powerful lobbying firms did not disclose the wide extent of its lucrative political work for a Ukrainian group tied to both onetime Trump adviser Paul Manafort and to pro-Russian politicians, new records show.

	The firm, the Podesta Group, said nothing in a 2012 lobbying report to Congress about at least 32 meetings, emails and other communications it had with the State Department, at a time when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was scrutinizing Ukraine's upcoming election, records show.

	...The Podesta Group was representing a Ukrainian nonprofit, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, as it sought to counter the Obama administration's critical stance toward Ukraine's pro-Russia government and Congress' growing annoyance with Ukraine's leaders.

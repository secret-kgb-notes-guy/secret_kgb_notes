	Clinton Praises Indonesian Democracy

	“Indonesia has experienced a great transformation in the last 10 years,” she said, referring to the Asian financial crisis of 1998, which led to the ouster of Suharto, its autocratic president, and set Indonesia on the path to becoming a robust democracy.

	“If you want to know if Islam, democracy, modernity and women’s rights can coexist, go to Indonesia,” she said at a dinner of academics, journalists, environmentalists and women’s rights advocates.

	Clinton Connections Paid Off for Indonesian Tobacco Tycoon’s Group

	An Indonesian tobacco magnate secured U.S. government assistance for his foundation after donating to Hillary Clinton’s and hiring lobbyists, themselves Clinton Foundation donors, who worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign.

	The Putera Sampoerna Foundation, founded by the Indonesian tobacco heir Putera Sampoerna, got the U.S. government to underwrite millions in loans offered by the foundation and secured high-profile support for its activities from Sec. Clinton and other senior federal officials.

	Loose regulations have also allowed the tobacco industry to target children, resulting in 20.3 per cent of teenagers aged 13 to 15 becoming smokers.

	In 2011, Philip Morris subsidiary Sampoerna erected a billboard in Jakarta depicting a young man reaching out to catch up with friends on a bus, with the slogan: “Dying is better than leaving a friend. Sampoerna is a cool friend.”

	A new online business training program for women entrepreneurs across America was featured today by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative America (CGI) meeting in Chicago.

	Clinton helped companies that donated to foundation profit off Africa

	...At the time, Lundin owned a 24.75 percent stake in the mine and another company, Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold, owned 57.5 percent, leaving the Congolese government in control of 17.5 percent of the mine.

	Freeport is also a major Clinton Foundation donor, giving between $250,000 and $500,000, according to donor records.

	The Congolese government saw its stake in the mine climb by just 2.5 percent in 2010 after talks that were thought to have been conducted by the State Department "in support of Freeport," the Financial Times reported that year.

	Is a U.S. Mining Company Funding a Violent Crackdown in Indonesia?

	...The strikers have a reason to be wary for their safety: Freeport is paying millions of dollars directly to the police officers who guard its mine, although Indonesia's police force has a history of brutality and corruption.

	...Rights organizations fear the security payments are tainting police neutrality in the region

	...In October, police officers opened fire on striking Freeport workers who were trying to board Freeport buses from the nearby town of Timika to demonstrate by the mine's gate. One striker died from gunshot wounds

	...Freeport has given $79.1 million to police and military forces in the past 10 years, according to a group called Indonesian Corruption Watch.  Most of that funding has been through in-kind contributions such as food, housing, fuel, and travel costs, but officers have also received direct payments.

	Democrats’ Tactic of Accusing Critics of Kremlin Allegiance Has Long, Ugly History in U.S.
	Glenn Greenwald

	A frequent weapon for Democrats in the 2016 election is to publicly malign those they regard as critics and adversaries as Russia sympathizers, Putin stooges, or outright agents of the Kremlin. To put it mildly, this is not a new tactic in U.S. political discourse, and it’s worth placing it in historical context. That’s particularly true given how many people have now been targeted with this attack.

	Strongly insinuating that the GOP nominee, Donald Trump, has nefarious, possibly treasonous allegiances to Moscow has migrated from Clinton-loyal pundits into the principal theme of the Clinton campaign itself. “The depth of Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin is revealing itself by the day,” her website announced yesterday

	...But this smear tactic extends far beyond Trump. It is now used to vilify anyone perceived to be an impediment to Clinton’s victory.

	At least 6 more women have accused the Fox News CEO of harassment

	...One, Kellie Boyle, alleges that Ailes propositioned her in 1989 after learning she was to sign a contract with the National Republican Congressional Committee. After she refused him, she was passed over for the job. 

	...Another woman, Marsha Callahan, was a model when she met Ailes in the 60s. She auditioned for The Mike Douglas Show, which he was producing at the time. She says he specifically requested that she wear a garter belt to the interview and that he asked her to lift her skirt up several times during their conversation. Callahan says that he told her that she needed to sleep with him to get the job, and that he said, “Oh, pretty girls like you are a dime a dozen.”

 	Russian President Vladimir Putin has formally divorced his wife Lyudmila after more than 30 years of marriage, Kremlin spokesman said on Wednesday, following a surprise breakup announcement last year.

	"The divorce has taken place," Dmitry Peskov said, without giving any further details. 

	...In 2008, Putin said there was no truth to a newspaper report that he was preparing to marry Olympic rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabayeva, who was born in 1983, the same year he married Lyudmila.

	Putin told journalists to keep their "snotty noses" out of his private affairs and the newspaper, Moskovsky Korrespondent, folded shortly afterwards.

	 The documents from the archive of the BND, Germany's spy agency, paint a dark picture of the Russian prime minister, who plans to return to the presidency next year.

	Gathering information through the work of an agent posing as an interpreter for Ludmilla Putina, Mr Putin's wife, the BND heard that the then youthful 33-year-old spy chief was a "wife beater and a philanderer" during his stint in the German city from 1985 to 1990.

	One of Hillary Clinton’s biggest weapons is the fact that she is a woman.

	In 2016, there are few tools greater than this one, which goes to show just how far feminism has drifted from its original purpose. Instead of promoting the equality of women, the modern feminist movement exists solely to silence men who happen to disagree with leftists on any subject

	U//FOUO) The FBI investigation determined some Clinton aides and senior-level State employees were aware Clinton used a personal e-mail address for State business during her tenure. Clinton told the FBI it was common knowledge at State that she had a private e-mail address because it was displayed to anyone with whom she exchanged e-mails.175 However, some State employees interviewed by the FBI explained that e-mails from Clinton only contained the letter "H" in the sender field and did not display her e-mail address.176•177•178 The majority of the State employees interviewed by the FBI who were in e-mail contact with Clinton indicated they had no knowledge of the private server in her Chappaqua 'd 179 180 181 182 183 184 Cl' I • d' 'd . 1 d M'll Ab d' J b res1 ence. · · · · · mton s 1mme 1ate a1 es, to me u  e     1 s, e m, aco Sullivan, aa an~ ltold the FBI they were unaware of the existence of the private server until after Clinton's tenure at State or when it became public knowledge.

	However, State employees were cautioned about security and records retention concerns regarding the use of personal e-mail. In 2011, a notice to all State employees was sent on Clinton's behalf, which recommended employees avoid conducting State business from personal e-mail accounts due to information security concerns. 203 Clinton stated she did not recall this specific notice, and she did not recall receiving any guidance from State regarding e-mail policies outlined in the State F AM. 204 Interviews with two State employees determined that State issued guidance which required employees who used personal e-mail accounts for State business to forward those work-related e-mails to their official State account for record-keeping purposes. 


Clinton advised personal email insecure

following: rejected using SMART system for recordkeeping

	FBI investigation and the State OIG report determined that State issued regular notices to staff during Clinton's tenure highlighting cybersecurity threats and advising that mobile devices must be configured to State security guidelines. 270'271 Clinton and her immediate staff were notified of foreign travel risks and were warned that digital threats began immediately upon landing in a foreign country, since connection of a mobile device to a local network provides opportunities for foreign adversaries to intercept voice and e-mail transmissions. 

warned about sending email from other countries

...approximately [REDACTED] e-mails wer sent or recieved by Clinton on her personal e-mail accounts while she was traveling outside ... OCONUS on official State business.

	Clinton told the FBI that, after her staff completed her e-mail production to State in December 2014, she was asked what she wanted to do with her remaining personal e-mails, Clinton instructed her staff she no longer needed the e-mails. 356 Clinton stated she never deleted, nor did she instruct anyone to delete, her e-mails to avoid complying with FOIA, State or FBI requests for information.

	The FBI identified three e-mail chains, encompassing eight individual e-mail exchanges to or from Clinton's personal e-mail accounts, which contained at least one paragraph marked "(C)," a marking ostensibly indicating the presence of information classified at the CONFIDENTIAL level. 


interesting, 3 chains with (C), 8 emails. Comey says 3 "documents"


	...When asked of her knowledge regarding TOP SECRET,  SECRET, and CONFIDENTIAL classification levels of USG information, Clinton responded that she did not pay attention to the "level" of classification and took all classified information seriously. 


------
pg 20-21

	Twelve of the e-mail chains, classified by State as SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL, were not among the approximately 30,000 e-mails provided to State and the FBI by Williams & Connolly.

	The Public Affairs officials primarily relied upon reporting from country desk officers to generate talking points and believed the country desk officers were experienced in protecting sensitive information within their reporting. 410 The Public Affairs officials were also responsible for notifying State leadership of impending reports by the news media regarding sensitive or controversial topics. 411 Furthermore, a former DOD official explained that he sent an e-mail, since deemed to contain classified information, in order to quickly coordinate public affairs responses by State and DOD with respect to a specific incident referenced in the e-mail. 4


so the DoD guy used unclass email for classified to coordinate something quickly, but Clinton didn't apparently during Benghazi

also maybe the PAO stuff has something to do with Clinton disucssing class info "in press reports"

	A majority of the USIC executives interviewed expressed concerns with how State handled [REDACTED]. According to a USIC executive who had been stationed overseas State employees were aware of the sensitivities [REDACTED].

Bluenthal secret srouces for his 172 classified emails (KGB so they can use clinton as an excuse for why they have the info in the first place? idk)

	There were no-emails provided by WIlliams & Connolly to State or the FBI dated from January 21, 2009 to March 18, 2009. FBI investigation identified an additional 18 days were Clinton did not provide State any responsive e-mail. FBI investigations determined 14 of the 18 days where Clinton did not provide State any responsive e-mail correspond with e-mail outages affecting Clinton's perosnal server systems as a result of both Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy. FBI investigation indicated other explanations for gaps in Clinton's e-mail production could include user deletion prior to PRN's transfer of Clinton's e-mails for review, or flaws in the archiving and sorting process used to generate the responsive production to State.


That initial gap was something she was asked about iirc? or indirectly?

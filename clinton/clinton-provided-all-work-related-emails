	CLINTON: Yes?

	QUESTION: Did you or any of your aides delete any government- related e-mails from your personal account? And what lengths are you willing to go to to prove that you didn't?

	Some people, including supporters of yours, have suggested having an independent arbiter look at your server, for instance.

	CLINTON: We did not. In fact, my direction to conduct the thorough investigation was to err on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related.

	That doesn't mean they will be by the State Department once the State Department goes through them, but out of an abundance of caution and care, you know, we wanted to send that message unequivocally.

	That is the responsibility of the individual and I have fulfilled that responsibility, and I have no doubt that we have done exactly what we should have done. When the search was conducted, we were asking that any email be identified and preserved that could potentially be federal records, and that's exactly what we did.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/22/transcript-clinton-testifies-before-house-committee-on-benghazi/
	JORDAN: We -- we know the National Archive has -- Secretary Clinton, we know the National Archive has said 1,250 were clearly personal. No way we should have -- no way you should have sent them to the State Department.

	And then we also know that 15, you missed, because we got those from Mr. Blumenthal when he came in -- was -- was -- for his deposition.

	CLINTON: Thank you.

	JORDAN: So if you -- you missed 15 you should have given us, and you gave us 1,250 that -- not we say, but the national archivist says -- you never should have turned over. You erred on both sides. So again, that's why we want to know the terms. Because if you've made a mistake both ways, you may to made -- might have made more mistakes. We don't know.

	CLINTON: Well, first of all, you had nine hours with one of my attorneys. And since I think the Democrats just finally released the transcript, I haven't had a chance...

	JORDAN: And I -- and I specifically asked Ms. Mills. I did.

	CLINTON: ...well...

	JORDAN: I did. I asked her about this and she gave me the -- basically the same kind of answer you're giving me.

	CLINTON: Well, she'll be happy to supplement the record if (inaudible).

	JORDAN: But she's not on the witness stand today. You are, and I'm asking you.

	CLINTON: Well, but I -- I asked my attorneys to do it. I thought that was the appropriate way to proceed.

	...GOWDY: You think our first request, there were only eight emails responsive to our first request?

	CLINTON: I can't speak to it. I believe your first request was for Benghazi. And I believe that the State Department did a diligent search. Then I believe you expanded it to Libya and weapons and maybe a few other terms. And I believe they conducted a diligent...

	GOWDY: Well, our jurisdiction hasn't grown, Madam Secretary. Our jurisdiction is the same thing it was.

	Let me ask you this. You say that you turned over everything. I don't get a chance to watch you a lot on television, but when I see you are interviewed, you make a point of saying, I turned over everything.

	CLINTON: All my work related emails, yes.

	GOWDY: How do you know that?

	CLINTON: I know that because there was an exhaustive search done under the supervision of my attorneys, and that is exactly the outcome. We turned over every work related email, in fact, as somebody referred to earlier, we turned over too many.

	The State Department and the National Archives said there are 1,246 out of the 30,000-plus that they have already determined did not need to be turned over.

	GOWDY: And you have a really...

	SANCHEZ: Regular order, Mr. Chairman.

	GOWDY: ... good group of attorneys, which makes me wonder...

	SANCHEZ: Chairman, regular order.

	GOWDY: ... how they missed 15 of them.

	CLINTON: Well if you are talking about Mr. Blumenthal, which I assume you are, he had some that I didn't have, and I had some that he didn't have. And he -- I was under no obligation to make any of his emails available unless I decided they were work related.

	And the ones that I decided that were work related I forwarded to the state.gov accounts of the people with whom I worked.

	I, Hillary Rodham Clinton, declare under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct:

	1) While I do not know what information may be "responsive" for purposes of this law suit, I have directed that all my e-mails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or potentially were federal records be provided to the Department of State, and on information and belief, this has been done.

	2) As a result of my directive, approximately 55,000 pages of these e-mails were produced to the Department on December 5, 2014

	3) Cheryl Mills did not have an account on clintonemail.com. Huma Abedin did have such an account which was used at times for government business.

	The instant communication documents an analysis conducted by the author regarding the Department of State (DoS) tenure e-mail correspondence between the personal accounts of HILLARY CLINTON (hdr22@clintonemail.com) and HUMA ABEDIN (huma@clintonemail.com). The author analyzed e-mail correspondence across the various datasets acquired by the FBI during the course of its investigation. Ultimately, the author identified approximately 1,539 direct e-mails between hdr22@clinconemail.com and huma@clintonemail.com (i.e., no other email address was party to the e-mail communication) which were not provided to DOS by Clinton in December in 2014, but were assessed by the FBI to be work-related.

	Key Findings

	- Analysis of two datasets in the FBI's possession revealed approximately 1,539 unique work-related e-emails involving only two parties: hdr22@clintonemail.com and huma@clintonemail.com (hereafter, referred to as "CA party e-mails"). Hillary Clinton's legal team only turned over 32 CA party emails to the State Department on December 2014.

	- When conducing their review of the ~60,000 emails, Hillary Clinton's legal team possibly failed to assess the entirety of huma@clintonemail.com (hereafter, "Huma CE") e-mail correspondence with Clinton determine which were work-related. All Huma CE e-mails in the 30,524 e-mail dataset contained another search term used in the legal team review process (e.g., names and emails of key individuals, "Libya," "Benghazi"), indicating Huma CE and Abedin's name were possibly not used as their own search terms to identify those emails for production.

	GOWDY: Secretary Clinton said neither she nor anyone else deleted work related e-mails from her personal account. Was that true?

	QUESTION: Madam Secretary?

	CLINTON: Hi.

	QUESTION: How could the public be assured that when you deleted emails that were personal in nature, that you didn't also delete emails that were professional, but possibly unflattering?

	And what do you think about this Republican idea of having an independent third party come in an examine your emails?

	CLINTON: Well first of all, you have to ask that question to every single federal employee, because the way the system works, the federal employee, the individual, whether they have one device, two devices, three devices, how many addresses, they make the decision.

	So, even if you have a work-related device with a work-related .gov account, you choose what goes on that. That is the way our system works. And so we trust and count on the judgment of thousands, maybe millions of people to make those decisions.

	And I feel that I did that and even more, that I went above and beyond what I was requested to do. And again, those will be out in the public domain, and people will be able to judge for themselves.

	The FBI's report on Clinton's email use includes information about Powell's warning to Clinton that using a government email meant her messages would become public.

	In the email exchange Powell wrote "there is a real danger."

	"Government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law," he said.

	He added: "Be very careful ... I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data."

	1. The ‘oh shit’ moment

	After Clinton’s staff members completed their response to the State Department for her email records in December 2014, Clinton said she told staff that she did not need them anymore.

	“In or around this same timeframe the retention policy for her email was changed as part of her move to a new personal office account,” the FBI stated in notes from Clinton’s interview.

	Former chief of staff Cheryl Mills said that Clinton in December 2014 decided she did not need access to any of her emails older than 60 days. But, according to a redacted source, another redacted entity did not modify the retention policy on Clinton’s clintonemail.com account until March 2015.

	“In his interviews with the FBI, [redacted] indicated that sometime between March 25-31, 2015, he realized” that he did not make the changes requested by Mills the previous December, and in a Feb. 18, 2016, interview with the FBI, [redacted] indicated that he did not “recall conducting deletions based upon this realization.”

	Speaking to the FBI on May 3, 2016, “[redacted] indicated he believed he had an ‘oh shit’ moment and sometime between March 25-31, 2015 deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the PRN server and used BleachBit to delete the exported .PST files he had created on the server system containing Clinton’s e-mails.”

	[REDACTED] was asked to delete approximately two emails related to the public release of Secretary CLINTON's emails. The request was in relation to cleaning unclassified State systems, however, due to an FBI preservation request, [REDACTED] had not deleted any communications. He recalled one of the emails being from an Ambassador and began with a phrase similar to "My classnet is down, so I'll start here..."


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	Now, that seems to me to provide some context to what took place here. Did Secretary Clinton’s legal team — excuse me, let me ask it this way. Did Secretary Clinton know her legal team deleted those e- mails that they kept from us?

	COMEY: I don’t believe so.

	JORDAN: Did Secretary Clinton approve those e-mails being deleted?

	COMEY: I don’t think there was any specific instruction or conversation between the Secretary and her lawyers about that.

	A State Department official offered a "quid pro quo" deal if the FBI would change the classification of a Hillary Clinton email, FBI documents indicate.

	In exchange, an FBI agent said, Mr Kennedy offered to accept an FBI request for extra agents at foreign diplomatic posts.

	QUESTION: Can you explain how you decided which of the personal e-mails to get rid of, how you got rid of them and when? And how you'll respond to questions about you being the arbiter of what you release? 

	CLINTON: ...In going through the e-mails, there were over 60,000 in total, sent and received. About half were work-related and went to the State Department and about half were personal that were not in any way related to my work. I had no reason to save them, but that was my decision because the federal guidelines are clear and the State Department request was clear.

	For any government employee, it is that government employee's responsibility to determine what's personal and what's work-related. I am very confident of the process that we conducted and the e-mails that were produced.

	JORDAN: So you don't know? You don't know what terms they used to determine which ones were your e-mails and which ones the State Department got, and therefore we might get?

Because there were — let me go back to this, yes or no, were there or were there not classified e-mails that her — that Hillary Clinton’s attorneys read?

	COMEY: I don’t know whether they read them at the time.

	CHAFFETZ: They — did Hillary Clinton give non-cleared people access to classified information?

	COMEY: Yes. Yes.

	CHAFFETZ: What do you think her intent was?

	COMEY: I think then was to get good legal representation and to make the production to the State Department. That can be a very tall order, in that circumstance (ph) I don’t see the evidence there to make a case that she was acting with criminal intent in her engagement with her lawyers.

	Those 55,000 pages, there were 62,00 e-mails -- total e-mails, on your system. You have stated that you used a multi-step process to determine which ones were private, which ones were public, which ones belonged to you and your family, which ones belonged to the taxpayer.

	Who oversaw this multi-step process in making that determination which ones we might get and which ones that were personal?

	CLINTON: That was overseen by my attorneys and they conducted a rigorous review of my e-mails and...

	JORDAN: These are the folks sitting behind you there, Mr. Kendall, Ms. Mills...

	CLINTON: Yes, that's right.

	JORDAN: ...Ms. Danielsen (ph)? All right.

	And you said rigorous. What does that mean?

	CLINTON: It means that they were asked to provide anything that could be possibly construed as work related. In fact, in my opinion -- and that's been confirmed by both the State Department...

	JORDAN: But I'm asking how -- I'm asking how it was done. Was -- did someone physically look at the 62,000 e-mails, or did you use search terms, date parameters? I want to know the specifics.

	CLINTON: They did all of that, and I did not look over their shoulders, because I thought it would be appropriate for them to conduct that search, and they did.

	Home video footage from 2000, shot at a fundraiser by a donor, Peter Paul, showed then-Sen. Clinton talking about how she had chosen to avoid email for fear of leaving a paper trail.

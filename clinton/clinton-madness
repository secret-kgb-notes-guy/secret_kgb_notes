	Timid Liberals Blew the Election by Flinching at Hillary Clinton’s Email Server

	Kevin Drum

	So here’s what we’ve got. Clinton used a private server for her unclassified emails. However, that doesn’t provide any reason to think she was any more careless about discussing classified information than any other secretary of state. Nevertheless, Republicans used the excuse of the Benghazi investigation to demand an inspector general’s audit of her emails. The intelligence community, naturally, concluded that Clinton’s archives contained thousands of discussions of classified programs. They would most likely conclude the same thing if they audited the email account of any ranking State Department official. It’s just a fact of life that State and CIA disagree about this stuff.

	The Squalid Case Against Hillary and Her Emails
	By John Dean 

	Endless efforts by congressional Republicans to foil or foul up Hillary Clinton’s run for the presidency have hit a new low.

	The members of Congress involved cannot be sued for defamation, since they are protected by the “Speech and Debate Clause” of the Constitution. But the fact that they are not merely smearing the former secretary of state but are trying to send her to jail on phony charges of perjury and lying to Congress is beyond the pale of dirty politics.

	National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster's denial didn't really hit all the points of what Monday's Washington Post story alleged, Dean noted, sparking speculation from critics that it was essentially a non-denial denial.

	"It is conspicuous," he said. "It's very obvious they are not banging away at the story itself. They are playing around it. I don't know if they think this will get confused in translation or what's going to happen. It's not a very strong defense even."

	Hillary Clinton’s Emails: Republicans Revel in Another Fake Scandal
	By Neil H. Buchanan

	...Comey has already gone outside of his portfolio and given Republicans some talking points that they will surely enjoy repeating. Even though the bottom line of his comments is, "There are a bunch of things here that bother me, but this was not a close call," Comey did give Republicans some political sustenance.  

	For Republicans, however, that is never enough.  They will overplay this, as they always do.

	 Time for Careful Lying by Team Trump
	by Neil H. Buchanan

	...after The Washington Post's blockbuster May 15 scoop that Trump had revealed highly classified information to two top officials of the Russian government, the Administration sent out Trump's national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, to do some careful lying.

	The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is a national security risk, and half of the country doesn't care, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said on Tuesday.

	Democrats Suddenly Very Concerned About Email Hacking

	After spending a year downplaying the risk of Hillary Clinton’s highly vulnerable email server getting hacked — and exposing the classified documents it wasn’t supposed to contain — to foreign intelligence services, Democrats are suddenly very concerned about email hacking. That’s because they desperately need to discredit the devastating leak of DNC emails as a Russian dirty trick to rig the U.S. election.

	Poll: Clinton, Trump most unfavorable candidates ever

	Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in more than 30 years of ABC News/Washington Post polling.

	Poll: 6 in 10 dislike or hate Trump and Clinton


https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/11/trump-election-foreign-policy/505934/
	Thomas Wright: Firstly, I’m not saying that Trump is equivalent to Nazis in Germany—to their rise. But since those elections, I think there’s never been an election where so much is riding on how a major power would behave in the world. What’s unique about this election is that Trump has a very, very different notion of American foreign policy and [America’s] global role, and would dramatically change U.S. foreign policy if he was elected. Since the world is essentially organized around American power and American intentions, that would have an enormously disruptive effect...

	...To some degree it’s about his views on authoritarianism. But also his first view reinforces his third view: He’s already of the view that the U.S. shouldn’t really be in NATO or in Europe, helping Europe defend itself from Russia. 

	...We underestimate just how much he’s committed to this. He’s been voluntarily speaking about this for three decades. Everyone accuses him of not studying, and that is true. But in this very narrow way, when he says he listens to himself [for foreign-policy advice]...

	Friedman: Do you think the president of the United States has the power to undo that order single-handedly? ...

	Wright: I think the answer, unfortunately, is yes

	...what would probably happen is that the world would become much more dangerous in terms of other countries coming close to conflict with each other

	...I [also] think the global economy would take a huge dive. There would probably be a very severe recession because the U.S. would not be guaranteeing the openness of the global economy. Trump’s position basically is: For the U.S. economy to do well, other countries must do worse.

	Welcome to the next, most negative presidential election of our lives

	Hillary Clinton is the first female nominee of a major American political party, and she would love for you to vote for the first female president.

	But she's okay if you just want to vote against Donald Trump.


https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/magazine/hillary-clinton-campaign-final-weeks.html
	Clinton told me. “I’m trying to run a campaign that presents an alternative case.” It’s telling that a candidate with the name recognition, résumé and baggage of Hillary Clinton is nonetheless left to present her campaign as an “alternative case.”

	...As I was leaving our interview, she smiled, looked me in the eyes and left me with a casual reminder. “As I’ve told people,” she said, “I’m the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse.”

	13 Percent of People Would Rather Have a Meteor Hit Earth Than Elect Trump or Clinton

	How much do some people hate the idea of a President Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?

	Apparently enough that they'd rather die in an apocalyptic event than see it become a reality.

	According to the latest survey by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling, 13 percent of people would rather have a giant meteor hit Earth than elect Clinton or Trump.

	The exact question: "If the choices for President were Democrat Hillary Clinton, Republican Donald Trump, and a Giant Meteor hitting the earth which would you choose?"

	About 43 percent opted for Clinton, 38 percent for Trump, 13 percent for the giant meteor, and 7 percent were unsure.

	In one poll, the lowest ever. And when voters were asked, "What is the first word that comes to mind when you think of Hillary Clinton?" Words like liar, dishonest, untrustworthy were at the top of the list. Does this tell you that your original explanation about the private server, that you did it to carry one phone out of convenience, that this didn't sit well with the American people?

	HILLARY CLINTON: Well, David, obviously, I don't like hearing that...

	DAVID MUIR: ...Americans have watched you as First Lady, they watched you run for Senate, they watched you run for president the first time. You served as Secretary of State. And now you're running for president a second time. And I, I wanna know in your most private of moments, is there ever an instance when you ask yourself, "Why am I doing this again?"

	Some 39 percent said they would prefer that U.S. President Barack Obama declare himself president for life than hand over power to Clinton or Trump, with 26 percent saying the nation would do better to select its next leader in a random lottery.

	Some 23 percent, nearly one in four, preferred the giant meteor outcome to either Trump or Clinton.

	Using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both republicans and democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps arti-factually) founded in policy attitudes. The more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns;

	...presidential campaigns have since become more antagonistic and harder to ignore.

	...our analyses suggest that greater levels of negativity in advertising campaigns and general exposure to political campaigns both contribute to higher levels of affective polarization. Campaigns reinforce voters’ sense of partisan identity and confirm stereotypical beliefs about supporters and opponents

	Populists vs. Elitists

	...Meanwhile, under Hillary Clinton, the Democrats are now the elitist establishment party.

	...For their part, the Democrats haven’t changed much.  The big change is that they are trying to hide their true selves, and they are using big money to help them do the hiding.

	However, if we take a close look, we can see that the Democratic Party is as devoted to its pet causes as ever, including quotas of all kinds and fawning treatment for street radicalism.

	...So the Democrats, being bought and paid for, can’t help but appear smug and oblivious.

	As Republicans and Democrats begin gathering this week for their national conventions, the partisan divide between both parties is the widest it’s been in at least a quarter century.

	...But voters aren’t just frustrated with members of the opposing side. They’re also fearful of them. More than half of Democrats say the GOP makes them “afraid,” while 49 percent of Republicans say the same about Democrats. Nearly half of all Republicans say Democrats make them feel angry, and vice versa.

	In many cases, the study notes, “negative feelings about the opposing party are as powerful — and in many cases more powerful — as are positive feelings about one’s own party.”

	...APA offers the following tips to help people manage their stress related to the election:

	- If the 24-hour news cycle of claims and counterclaims from the candidates is causing you stress, limit your media consumption. Read just enough to stay informed. Turn off the newsfeed or take a digital break. Take some time for yourself, go for a walk, or spend time with friends and family doing things that you enjoy.

	- Avoid getting into discussions about the election if you think they have the potential to escalate to conflict. Be cognizant of the frequency with which you’re discussing the election with friends, family members or coworkers.

	Dozens of passengers fled a plane and police removed their United Airlines pilot after she gave a long, bizarre speech before takeoff on Saturday.

	...The pilot touched on recent politics.


http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/02/11/emotional-pilot-removed-from-sfo-bound-flight-after-bizarre-rant/
	“She started off by saying that she had not voted for either Trump or Clinton because they’re a bunch of liars,” said passenger Noel Portugal. “That’s an odd way to start of the welcome to your flight. It really sort of went downhill from there and didn’t make a lot of sense to any of us.”


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/02/12/a-united-pilot-ranted-about-trump-clinton-and-divorce-her-passengers-fled/
	“She’s like ‘I don’t care if you voted for Trump or Clinton. They’re both [expletive],” Reiss wrote.

	When she changed the subject to the plane’s imminent takeoff, Reiss began to shake, and another passenger began videotaping the drama.

	“So I’ll stop, and we’ll fly the airplane,” the pilot said in the video, which has since been removed from YouTube. “Don’t worry. I’m going to let my co-pilot fly it. He’s a man.”

	...He heard one flier yell “Stop!” at the pilot. Others were crying as they streamed back to the terminal.

	...“People were pleading … ‘Please call security,'”

	...Before he re-boarded, Reiss said, he watched police walk the pilot back through the airport.

	The pilot apologized and hugged him before they parted, he said.

	She offered to write a book with him.

	It looked to him as if she’d been crying, too.

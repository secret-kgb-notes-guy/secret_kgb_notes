In the course of the 2016 election, Secretary Clinton might have been overzealous in her courting of the media:

http://thehill.com/media/303552-poll-public-overwhelmingly-thinks-media-is-in-the-tank-for-clinton
	"The American public thinks the media wants Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to win by an almost 10-to-1 margin, according to a new poll.

	The Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Friday asks, "Who do you think the media, including major newspapers and TV stations, would like to see elected president: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?"

	Of the 1,000 adults surveyed, 75.9 percent answered Clinton, while just 7.9 percent picked Trump, the Republican nominee. Just more than 16 percent of respondents chose either "neither" or "undecided.""

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/13/emails-show-cozy-relationship-between-media-and-cl/
	"Leaked emails show that Hillary Clinton’s campaign officials boasted about getting favorable news coverage from compliant journalists, received political advice from cozy reporters and circulated the names of journalists who were “friendly” to the candidate."

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/31/donna-brazile-fired-cnn-contributor/
	"CNN announced Monday that it had severed ties with acting Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile in the wake of leaked emails showing that she shared questions for CNN-sponsored candidate events with friends on Hillary Clinton’s campaign."

Although there are reports that Trump might be motivated to act in the Kremlin's interest due to blackmail or offers of money, past statements by him indicate he is motivated by ideology:

This is consistent with previously known strategies in active measures. In the past, Russia had tried to install Communist dictators in target countries:

http://uselessdissident.blogspot.com/2008/12/love-letter-to-america-part-one.html
    "We rarely use guns to kill people and take their country. The cleanest way is to blackmail, pervert, bribe, lie and intimidate the POLITICIANS and the MEDIA, and they will destabilize and disunify their own country for us. Then all we have left to do is to arm the procommunist or simply criminal factions and we have a coup and another "liberated" country. As neat as that."

However, Russia has since switched out Communism for a new ideology:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/14/putin-trump-and-the-wests-new-ideological-alliance/
	"Russia under its autocratic president, Vladimir Putin, is not pulling all the strings in this vast, rightward turn. But his government has actively pushed for such a realignment. A November report published by the Atlantic Council outlined how, through a network of media affiliates and political alliances in various European countries, Russia “seeks to infiltrate politics, influence policy, and inculcate an alternative, pro-Russian view of the international order.”

	The examples are legion. Ultranationalist parties across the continent, from Hungary to Sweden, have been courted by Moscow. France's far-right National Front, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, stands a good chance of winning presidential elections next year, received sizable loans from Russian banks. A leading champion of the populist, anti-establishment move toward Brexit — the nickname for Britain's departure from the European Union — appeared regularly on Russia Today, a state-funded international media company.

	In various ways, they all articulate a worldview that rejects globalization and liberal values in favor of a more muscular nationalism at home. This is in line with Moscow's thinking. Le Pen has called for an end to European sanctions on Russia and supported Putin's annexation of Crimea. These far-right parties also operate at a moment where declining trust in national governments and establishment media has led to a proliferation of conspiracy theories, sometimes fueled by groups or leaks linked to the Kremlin."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoliy_Golitsyn#New_Lies_for_Old
    "In 1984, Golitsyn published the book New Lies For Old,[15] wherein he warned about a long-term deception strategy of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the United States."

With Trump, it appears that Russia's strategy has not changed. Trump's view of the world as dominated by strongmen is aligned with Putin's. This alone may explain Trump's peculiar fondness for Putin and apparent lack of respect for his own country's people and values.

Hello,

As you know, Secretary Clinton has some unfortunate character issues:

Secretary Clinton should have treated her security staff with more respect. Failing to do so hurt morale, and might have made it harder for them to do their jobs.

Clinton also has issues with following agreed-upon rules:

Secretary Clinton should not have violated her memorandum of understanding barring foreign donations to her foundation while serving as Secretary of State. Doing so reduces public trust that our government will remain free from foreign influence and follow its own rules.

Clinton also has issues with taking responsibility for her actions:

When asked if she was carless in her handling of classified information and should have known better, Secretary Clinton implied that if she were careless, other State Department employees were carless too. To show leadership, Clinton should have instead admitted she was careless, and taken responsibility for the lax security culture at the State Department she headed at the time.

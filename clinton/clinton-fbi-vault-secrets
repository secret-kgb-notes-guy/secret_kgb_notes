"Evidence of Hillary Clinton's misuse of classified documents"

Incident Type: Criminal Activity

oh ok

so wat is it?

	explained to writer he had sent evidence of Hillary Clinton's misuse of classified documents to the FBI Director earlier in January 2016, but when he called to confirm receipt he could not do so and therefore wanted to talk-in to make sure the information was received by the right people at the FBI, specifically the "task force" working on the Clinton e-mail scandal.

	[redacted] explained he was a long-term government employee and had previously worked for many years at the Department of State. He provided a resume and a U.S. Foreign Service Employee Evaluation Report to prove his bonafides.

	[redacted] did not go in to detail as to what the evidence was as he had provided other typed documents explaining the evidence to the unclassified level he could. He offered to be interviewed in a SCIF so he could talk at a higher classification level to further explain other evidence he had.

this badass right here

damn

"I have information that could lead to Hillary Clinton's arrest"

	All of the documents provided by [redacted] are being attached in a 1A for further review by the appropriate personnel reviewing this matter.


so where's the evidence


------

pg 35

Senate Judiciary Committee writing Comey

Saying there is a conflict of interest here, press reports of DOJ acting funny


so they knew the whole time! wtf did I even email them for?

although this was senate, not house


Saying need a special prosecutor

also weird that no grand jury impanneled

pg 39

hinting at public corruption/clinton foundation investigation (still ongoing?)


pg 41

asks him questions to try to get him to say need a special counsel?


Sent by Grassley Leahy, Tillis and Carter


So did Comey reply?

Why now special counsel?

he seemd to think DOJ was fucky


wait did they ask him any of these in heraings? I don't think so

so maybe got answer?


---

also btw

"Clinton World" = KGB?

I mean obviously, right?


KGB is like "she thinks she has friends! ahahhahahah"


pg 53

Got some huma HRC emails that Clinton didn't turn over December 2014

just an "accident" I guess?

directly between hdr22@clintonemail.com and huma@clintonemail.com

This was on 7/15/2016

the missing huma emails???

and then they thought they found them on Wiener's laptopt?

I don't get it


idk I guess there were some missing huma emails, and maybe they thought there were more, like she was hiding something, but it all just turned out to be a ploy by the Russians to use Comey to rig the election


blames the process Clinton's lawyers used to find work-related

I think I saw that somewhere else

Did they really just search "Benghazi" "Libya" or "Tripoli" and say "here's all the work-related emails!"?

I don't get why they can't just subpeona the whole thing? I guess that was the problem with the grand jury thing?


pg 65

"Confidential human source" not in a position to testify

$10 the whole investigation was just the KGB fucking with the FBI to make them investigate everything and everywhere, go on wild goose chase and generate documents for Comey to release later during the election

 pg 88

"the Benghazi investigation" what's that

pg 121

something about pat Kennedy B9 an email get put in basement never to be seen

"told what was about & said no way"

	After reviewing an email dated Jul 1, 2012 with subject line "Fw: Congratulations!," CLINTON stated she received no particular guidance as to how she should use the President's email address [redacted]@who.eop.gov. Since the forgoing email was sent from Russia, CLINTON stated she must have sent it from the plane.

trip to Russia

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton Secretary Clinton addresses civil society leaders at the Consul General’s Residence in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 29, 2012.


eh so where was she exactly

do a FOIA?

I mean c'mon they wouldn't ask her that unless they knew she was in Russia

https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/travel/

what kind of bullshit is this

https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/travel/2012/index.htm

wtf is this

Clinton hides her travel?


------
	Clinton could not recall any briefing or training by State related to the retention of federal records or handing of classified information.


http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/10/23/2010-video-shows-hillary-clinton-lecturing-state-dept-staff-cybersecurity
	Despite conducting her own government business through a personal “homebrew” server while secretary of state, Hillary Clinton is seen in a newly obtained video lecturing her staff of their “special duty” to recognize the importance of cybersecurity.

	“The real key to cybersecurity rests with you,” Clinton says in the 2010 video, which was obtained by FoxNews.com. “Complying with department computing policies and being alert to potential threats will help protect all of us.”



-------

	CLINTON was aware she was an ... OCA ... at state


-------

	In General, CLINTON knew SAP information was of great importance and needed to be handled carefully.


------

	...CLINTON could not recall a specific process for nominating a target for a drone strike


------


why do they ask her about leaking her blackberry number? travelling to Russia?

ask her if she ever lost her blackberry while travelling...

getting at something?


------

	CLINTON requested a secure BlackBerry while at State, but could not recall why they were unable to provide one. She was aware President Obama had one and it seemed convenient. Her request was not out of concern for the sensitivity of the information on her then-current device.

So why would she, ostensibly, want one? to be able to send confidential emails?

What is a confidential email to her then, anyway?

Seems to show some awareness of classification/security here too?


	CLINTON wanted the secure BlackBerry to deal with any future contingencies and thought it would be a good idea to have a secure cell.

"just in case"?

	After reviewing a memo written for CHERYL MILLS by ERIC BOSWELL, CLINTON stated she never brought her unclassified BlackBerry into her SCIF for the reasons outlined in the memo. She would keep her BlackBerry outside of the SCI and check it in non-SCIF areas of State, when traveling to her office, at speeches, and other occasions outside of the office.


shows more knowledge of handling sensitive info

but apparently tries to say she's clueless on what's classified and what's not


------

	CLINTON did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system. She relied on State officials to use their judgement when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with with her regarding the sensitivty of the information she received at her email address.


her entire state department probably works for KGB

"shadow government"

and its all a way to have a mole in State via HRC

wasn't that in their propaganda? "she did it on purpose to give someone else access to it"

probably bullshit (I mean is propaganda), but maybe that's how the Russians think of it

a plausibly deniable mole

and apparently James Brein Comey thinks plausiby deniable moles should be legal


HMMMMMMM


	CLINTON had frequent in-person meeting with State personnel where classified information was communicated, including an 8:30 AM staff meeting and numerous other walk-in and walk-out meetins during the day.


So how does she know she's discussing classified information at those meetings and not over email?


-----

	After reviewing an email from POWELL with the subject line "RE: Question." CLINTON stated she did not want to guess precisely what POWELL was trying to say in paragraph three, but understood it to mean any communications of official business would be government records. This emails did not factor into her decision to use a personal email account.


http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/02/hillary-to-fbi-yes-colin-powell-warned-me-but-i-used-private-email-scheme-anyway/


interesting

warned that if they got a secure device it would be subject to federal reccordkeeping laws

I remember this now

Clinton trying to hide all her shady shit from every going public 

	That all changed when someone told The New York Times that Clinton told the FBI that Powell advised her to use the private email system.


------

	...She occasionally recieved odd looking email, but never noticed an increase in these types of of emails that would be a cause for concern.


Asking questions with an eye for security breaches?


-------

	After reviewing an email dated June 4, 2011 with the subject line "RE: Google email hacking and woeful state of civilian technology," CLINTON stated she did not recall the compromise of State employee's Gmail accounts. However, CLITON did recall the frustration over State's information technology systems.


Asking more "you sure you're systems weren't insecure?" questions\


------

	pg 5

	...Furthermore, CLINTON did not have any conversations with regard to using the server to avoide the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and specifically denied using the server to avoid Federal Records Act (FRA) requirements.

Why the discrepency?

but interesting FBI thinking this way too


	Based on her practice of emailing staff on their state.gov accounts, CLINTON assumed her communications were captured by State systems. CLINTON was not aware of State employee [redacted] expressing concerns CLINTON's email server was not compliant with the FRA.


------

	pg 6

	CLINTON stated deliberation over a future drone strike did not give her cause for concern regarding classification.


------

	pg 7

	CLINTON identified the portion of the email where [redacted] writes "let me know what you can via this channel" as being representative of the emphasis he placed on handling information appropriately. ...CLINTON stated State did the best they could not to confirm drone strikes and were as careful as possible, but had to deal with a "rash" of news reports on drones.


confirming drone strike to journalist?


------

	pg 7

	CLINTON stated [redacted] must have believed this email was "SBU" because that was how he marked it. CLINTON understood SBU to mean Sensitive But Unclassified.

https://fam.state.gov/fam/12fam/12fam0540.html

She's right!

Where did she learn that?

	FW: (SBU) email:

https://foia.state.gov/Search/results.aspx?searchText=*&caseNumber=F-2014-20439


-------

	After reviewing an email dated June 17, 2011, with subject line [redacted] CLINTON stated she did not remember the email specifically. CLINTON stated a "nonpaper" was a document with no official heading, or identifying marks of any kind, that can not be attributed to the US GOvernment to a foreign government and believed this practice went back "200 years."


http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/hillary-clinton-emails-nonsecure-gop-217510

Sounds like she's right?

	When viewing the displayed email, CLINTON blieved she was asking SULLIVAN to remove the State letterbead and provide unclassified talking points. CLINTON stated she had no intention to remove classifciation markings. CLINTON had no reccollection of actually recieiving a "nonpaper or secure fax in this instance. [redacted] talking points are typically classified, but CLINTON did notrecall in this instance.


The email:

eh anyway where did she learn about classification markings? that htese talking points are usually classified?


------
pg 9

	after reviewing an email dated april 9, 2012, with subject line "call to president banda," clinton  stated she did not remember the email specifically. when asked what the parenthetical "c" before a paragraph meant within the captioned email, clinton stated she did not know and could only speculate that it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order.	


https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_Jan29thWeb/O-2015-08637HCE10/DOC_0C05796118/C05796118.pdf


well there's the (C)...

where's the A and B? how does Clinton know about classified markings, SBU, but thinks (C) is alphabetical when there's no (A) or (B)?

And she warned colleagues about cybersecurity

seems to know shes' talking about classified info with her staff in offline meetings


	...CLINTON believed information should be classified in the case of covert military action, the use of sensitive sources and where sensitive deliberations took place. When asked whether CLINTON believed information should be classified if it is unauthorized release would cause damage to national security, she responded, "yes, that is the understanding." CLINTON believed the classification level of future drone strikes depended on the context. CLINTON believed drone strikes to be an "important tool" but also a program frequently in the press


------

	...However, in December 2012, CLINTON suffered a confussion and then around the New Year had a blood clot. Based on her doctors advice, she could only work at State for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received.


Is this an excuse? either way seems to have fueled the "conspiracy theories" about Clinton's health during the campaign. Planned?


------

pg. 10

	...CLINTON expected her team to provide any work-related or arguably work-related emails to State; however, she did not participate in the development of the specific process to be used or discussions of the locations where her emails might exist.

process of search for "Bengazi" or "Libya" apparently?


clearly the process missed some work related emails, clinton even confirms it next question


also

	CLINTON did not have any conversations regarding procedures if any potentially classified information was discovered during the review of her emails because she had no reason to believe classified iformation would be found in her email account.


but she asked "is this classified" for one of the things her aides sent her...

and is she really saying there's no reason to believe, after 4 years, the secretary of state has no reason to believe there's classified information in her email account?

	Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.

	For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. 


So he's letting Clinton get away with the "playing dumb" defense, basically?

except even still it only requires "gross negligence"

transcript of Jul 7 hearing

http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	FARENTHOLD: All right, well, at least that’s good to hear.

	All right, Section 793 of Title 18 in the United States Code makes it a crime to allow classified information to be stolen through gross negligence.
[12:30:05]
	
	FARENTHOLD: Were you to discover that hostile actors had actually gotten into Secretary Clinton’s e-mail, would that have changed your recommendation with respect to prosecuting her?

	COMEY: Unlikely, although we didn’t consider that question because we didn’t have those facts.


So it's not because the Russians didn't hacker (although he testifies no "direct evidence")


	FARENTHOLD: All right. I want to go back to the question of intent real quick, for just a second.

	I’m a recovering attorney. It’s been decades since I actually practiced law. But you kept referring to she had to know it was illegal to have the requisite criminal intent. I was always taught in law school, and I don’t know where this changed, that ignorance of the law was no excuse. If I’m driving a long at 45 miles and hour and didn’t see the 35 mile and hour speed limit, I was still intentionally speeding, even though I didn’t know it.

	Now, I might not have had the requisite criminal intent if maybe my accelerator were jammed or something like that, but even though I didn’t know the law was 35, I was driving 45, I’m going to get a ticket. And I’m probably going to be prosecuted for that.

	So, how can you say ignorance of the law is an excuse in Ms. Clinton’s case?

	COMEY: Well, the comparison to petty offenses, I don’t think is — you spoke about the question of — ignorance of the law is no excuse, but here’s the distinction. You have to have general criminal intent. You don’t need to know what particular statute you’re violating, but you must be aware of the generally wrongful nature of your conduct…

"general criminal intent"

wtf is that

but not for "petty" offenses

is this how the law works? ok

http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/osjcl/files/2016/07/Understanding-General-and-Specific-Intent-Eight-Things-I-know-For-Sure-Johnson.pdf

on of specific intent?  In purely causal terms, the discharge of the 
firearm is plainly a consequence of squ
eezing the trigger.  What is more, it 
appears to be a truly separate or additional event.  After all, sometimes pulling 
the trigger of a gun causes a gun to discharge, and sometimes it doesnt.  Thus, it 
seems as though a requirement that the defendant intend to discharge the firearm 
would count as a specific-intent element, rather than general-intent element. 
But  it  doesnt.    To  illustrate:  California  has  a  statute  that  prohibits 
discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner.
28
  The California courts 
have held that this statute requires proof that the defendant actually intended that 
the  firearm  go  off;  it  is  not  enough  that  he  intended  to  squeeze  the  trigger.
29
Nevertheless, the courts have said that this statute defines a general intent crime   
. . . because its mental state consists of an intent to do the act that causes the 
harm.
30
  Thus, the discharge of the firearm cant be an additional consequence 
for purposes of our definition of specific inten


what



https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/criminalLaw/basicElements/CommonLawMensRea.asp
	General intent crimes require that the defendant has intended to commit an illegal act. As such, the only state of mind that will suffice for a conviction is an intent to commit the act that constitutes the crime. If this has been established, the defendant can be convicted even if he never intended to violate the law, and even if he did not know that his act was criminal. For example:

	The crime "mayhem," which we will discuss in more depth a little bit later in the course, is loosely defined as the intentional disfigurement or maiming of another person. Since mayhem is a general intent crime, all the prosecution has to prove to secure a conviction is that the defendant intentionally committed the act that resulted in the victim’s disfigurement. In such a situation, the defendant will be convicted even if he did not intend to break the law with his actions and even if he did not know that his actions were illegal. Let’s assume that Defendant throws battery acid into Victim’s face and disfigures him. In order to secure a conviction, the prosecution will have to prove that Defendant intentionally threw the acid into Victim’s face. If the prosecution successfully proves this, Defendant can be convicted even if he did not intend to disfigure the victim and even if he did not know that disfiguring somebody was illegal. In other words, Defendant can be convicted for the general intent of throwing the acid in the victim’s face even if he did not have the specific intent of actually disfiguring the victim. For general intent crimes, under which this example fits, we don’t care what the defendant’s specific intent was. As long as the general intent of throwing acid in the victim’s face was there, he can be convicted of mayhem.

	Note that with regard to general intent crimes, intent does not have to be specifically proven. This would be a near impossible thing to do since there is no way to allow the jury to see the defendant's thought processes. Rather, intent can be inferred from the commission of the act itself and the surrounding circumstances. In other words, it can be presumed that the defendant intended to commit an act by virtue of the fact that he voluntarily committed it. See State v. Carlson, 93 N.W.2d 354 (Wis. 1958) 


	...Recklessness and Criminal Negligence

	For some crimes, a conviction can be based on a showing of recklessness or criminal negligence. Both of these terms refer to scenarios in which the defendant did not intend to commit the crime but was not careful enough with his or her actions in avoiding the criminal result. In these cases, the defendant can be convicted for an act done without the intent required for specific and general intent crimes, but rather, with a showing that the defendant acted with a gross lack of care. The difference between recklessness and negligence is a matter of degree, with recklessness being the higher level of guilt. Some of the most common examples of crimes that can be committed through recklessness or criminal negligence are involuntary manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and, as the name implies, reckless endangerment. For example:

	(1) One evening, Driver gets wasted at his local bar by drinking seven beers and then gets into his car and drives home. On the way home, Driver, predictably, loses control of his car and runs down a pedestrian, killing him. In many states, Driver has committed involuntary manslaughter. By getting behind the wheel while drunk, Driver exhibited reckless behavior. He can be convicted of reckless homicide despite his lack of intention to kill anyone.

	(2) While out on parole, Driver gets back into his car. Having learned his lesson about drunk driving, he is completely sober this time. However, he has not learned his lesson about driving carefully in general. While cruising at 55 miles per hour through a hospital zone (speed limit 15 MPH), he kills another pedestrian. Although Driver's conduct probably does not rise to the level of recklessness, he can still probably be liable for criminally negligent homicide, since it could reasonably be argued that driving at 40 miles per hour above the speed limit constitutes gross negligence.

	Certain crimes define the requisite mens rea in terms of “malice” or “willfulness”. However, these terms have no generally agreed upon meaning.

	For both the general intent and the specific intent crimes, the United States Constitution mandates that the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove both the elements of the crime and the intent required by the criminal statute beyond a reasonable doubt. If no intent is spelled out in a criminal statute, the crime is presumed to be a general intent crime.


so wtf is Comey talking about


	FARENTHOLD: We — now, so Congress when they enacted that statute said “gross negligence.” That — that doesn’t say intent. So what are we going to have to enact to get you guys to prosecute something based on negligence or gross negligence? Are we going to have to add, “and oh by the way, we don’t mean — we really do mean you don’t have to have intent there”?

	COMEY: That’s a conversation for you all to have with the Department of Justice. But it would have to be something more than the statute enacted in 1917. Because for 99 years, they’ve been very worried about its constitutionality.


wtf kind of answer is that?

DoJ punted to Comey, didn't they? so answer the fucking question

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/15/source-fbi-probe-clinton-email-focused-on-gross-negligence-provision.html
	Three months after Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email address and server while secretary of state was referred to the FBI, an intelligence source familiar with the investigation tells Fox News that the team is now focused on whether there were violations of an Espionage Act subsection pertaining to "gross negligence" in the safekeeping of national defense information.


This makes sense


building up that case, asking about Russia, leaks, security and such

	“Or Hillary Clinton - she got a primetime TV apologist political spin interview from President Obama himself,” Radack added.


We still need to hang Obama

https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/why-intent-not-gross-negligence-is-the-standard-in-clinton-case/


https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/249/47/case.html

what does this have to do with subsection (f)?

also looks like Okhrana operaitng in United States in 1919?

same leaflets promoting ANarchism, "don't go to work," "don't enlist" kind of thing.

Maybe wanted to affect World War I?

How long has Okhrana been in U.S.?

	The Espionage Act was left on the books, however, in the years after the war it was used only sparingly.  When it was used, it was often controversial because it resulted in prosecutions that civil libertarians believed infringed on press freedom and the right to political protest.  Perhaps the most famous of these cases is the prosecution of Daniel Ellsberg for leaking the Pentagon papers  The courts too grew wary of the Espionage Act and as a result their readings of it narrowed the scope of the law and limited when it could be used.


why does this guy hit everything the Russians have been doing...


	Justice Stanley Reed wrote the majority opinion and disagreed that the law was unconstitutionally vague, but only on the very narrow grounds that the law required “intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States.”


	The sections are not simple prohibitions against obtaining or delivering to foreign powers information… relating to national defense. If this were the language, it would need to be tested by the inquiry as to whether it had double meaning or forced anyone, at his peril, to speculate as to whether certain actions violated the statute.

obviously?


https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/312/19/case.html
	Where there is no occasion for secrecy, as with reports relating to national defense, published by authority of Congress or the military departments, there can, of course, in all likelihood, be no reasonable intent to give an advantage to a foreign government. Finally, we are of the view that the use of the words "national defense" has given them, as here employed, a well understood connotation. 


	At the conclusion of all the evidence, petitioners sought a directed verdict of acquittal because (1) the innocuous character of the evidence forbade a conclusion that petitioners had intent or reason to believe that the information

	Page 312 U. S. 29

	was to be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of a foreign nation and (2) the evidence failed to disclose that any of the reports related to or was connected with the national defense. As a corollary to this second contention, reversal is sought on the ground that the trial court overruled the petitioners' objection that, as a matter of law, none of the reports dealt with national defense. That is, as the trial court stated the objection, that


So what is it saying you have to have a reason to believe the information could harm the U.S. if it got released?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorin_v._United_States
	The jury rejected the arguments and convicted Gorin and Salich on all three counts.

https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11432/why-might-title-18-section-793-be-unconstitutional
	Q: During the House hearing today (July 7, 2016) Director Comey implied that section 793 of Title 18 might be unconstitutional as to applying the "gross negligence" standard to Hillary Clinton. What is the law that supports this reasoning as to unconstitutionality?

	A: We can only guess at what argument he has in mind...


-----


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	MASSIE: … But you did find one prosecution in — has it been overturned by the Supreme Court?

	COMEY: No, there was one time it was charged in an espionage case, and the guy ended up pleading guilty to a different offense so it was never adjudicated.

is that the only time it was ever charged?


-------


	MASSIE: OK, so they were having an e-mail conversation, but how in this e-mail conversation did this bore (ph) marking show up? Like, if they’re not sophisticated enough, as you said before, even Hillary Clinton wasn’t sophisticated enough to recognize a bore (ph) marking to, the “C” with the parenthesis for confidential or classified. If they weren’t that sophisticated, how did they recreate that bore marking in their e-mails when they’re having these discussions?

	COMEY: A lot of what ended up on Secretary Clinton’s server were stuff that had been forwarded up the chain. It gets to her from her stack, a lot of that, forwarding. And, then she comments sometimes on it. Someone down in the chain, in typing a paragraph that summarized something put a portion marking “C”, “paren”, “C”, “paren”, on that paragraph.

	MASSIE: Doesn’t it take a lot of intent to take a classified document from a setting that’s, you know, authorized and secure, to one that’s not? Wouldn’t it require intent for somebody to recreate that classification marking in an unsecure setting?

	COMEY: I don’t know. It’s possible, but also, I could…

	MASSIE: … Could you accidentally type, “Open parenthesis”, “C”, “closed parenthesis”, and indent the paragraph?

	COMEY: Oh no, you wouldn’t accidentally type…

	MASSIE: … Right…

	COMEY: … Someone actually down the chain…

	MASSIE: … OK, so this is my question is someone down the chain being investigated? Because they had the intent clearly if they had the sophistication — which Hillary Clinton, you insinuate, may have lacked. If they had the sophistication to know what this bore marking was, they had to have the intent to recreate it, or the intent to cut, copy, paste from a secure system to an unsecure system. Wouldn’t that be correct?

	COMEY: Potentially, but we’re not — there’s not an open criminal investigation of that person way down the chain…

	MASSIE: … Shouldn’t there be?

	COMEY: A criminal investigation?

	MASSIE: An investigation if there’s intent, which is what you — I mean, and I think you may be reasonable in requiring that threshold. Don’t we treat everybody the same whether they’re the top of the chain or the bottom of the chain?

	COMEY: Sure, you want to if the conduct is the same. We did not criminally investigate whoever started that chain and put the “C” on that — those paragraphs. We didn’t.


wtf is Comey doing

why can't he answer the "wouldn't it require intent" question?


and what about forwarding the email?

CLinton forwarded to huma non .gov address


with a big fat (c) on it


Although she removed it from a non-secure to non-secure place

seems like a violation of 1924 (a)?

http://www.thompsontimeline.com/congressional-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey/
	She had to have known about this statute because she had to have been briefed when she took over the job as the Secretary of State. So how, given that body of knowledge and experience, could this have happened in a way that could have potentially provided access by hackers to confidential information?

	COMEY: You know, it’s a good question. A reasonable question.

	The protection we have as Americans is that the government in general and in that statute in particular, has to prove before they can prosecute any of us, that we did this thing that’s forbidden by the law. And when we did it, we knew we were doing something that was unlawful. We don’t have to know the code number, but that we knew we were doing something that was unlawful. That’s the protection we have, one I have worked for very hard.

	When I was in the private sector, I did a lot of work with the Chamber of Commerce to stop the criminalization of negligence in the United States…


Did they plan this? a double-standard to make it as polarizing as possible


Comey is blatantly wrong


Democrats and Republicans are breathtakingly stupid


the whole attack relies on that


they can't think straight


they can't take a simple principle, even the fucking law, and apply it uniformly



	LUMMIS: Your know thought Mr. — may I interrupt and suggest that, this statute says, “knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the attempt to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location.” The intent here in the statute is to retain the documents at an unauthorized location. It’s not intent to pass them on to a terrorist or to someone out in Internet land, it’s just the intent to retain the documents or materials at an unauthorized location.

	COMEY: It’s more than that, though.

	You would have to show that and prove criminal intent both by law, that’s the way the judgment would instruct the jury, and practice by the Department of Justice. They have reserved that statute, even though it’s just a misdemeanor, for people who clearly knew they were breaking the law, and that’s the challenge.

	So should have known, must have know, had to know — does not get you there. You have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they knew they were engaged in something that was unlawful. That’s the challenge.


know what? if its some specific intent for harm, the statute doesn't even say what the harm is...


------

	BUCK: Okay. And did she then have the intent to retain such material at an unauthorized location? She retained the material that she received as secretary of state at her server in her basement and that was unauthorized.

	COMEY: You’re asking me did she have the — I’m going to ask you the burden of proof question in a second. But did she have the intent to retain classified information on the server or just to retain any information on the server?


Ok so that's how Comey reads it?


when she fowarded the email with the (C) on it to Huma's shitty unsecure email, did she intend to retain classified information in an unsecure location? or "any information"?


he sounds like her defense lawyer

also its not even that, its "knowingly" lift classified info, "intent" to retain in unauthorized location

Comey is rewriting law just to avoid reccomending indictment


------

	CHAFFETZ: Did you review the documents where Congressman Jim Jordan asked her specifically and she said, quote, “there was nothing marked classified on my e-mails either sent or received,” end quote?

	COMEY: I don’t remember reviewing that particular testimony, I’m aware of that being said, though.


woops


-------


	CHAFFETZ: You’ll have one. You’ll have one in the next few hours. Did Hillary Clinton break the law?

	COMEY: In connection with her use of the e-mail server, my judgment is that she did not.

	CHAFFETZ: Are you just not able to prosecute it or did Hillary Clinton break the law?

	COMEY: Both. I don’t want to give an overly lawyerly answer. The question I always look at is, is there evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody engaged in conduct that violated a criminal statute. And my judgment here there is not.


Judging the case, says not enough evidence


but for Trump he seems to think there is a lot of evidence, since he wanted a special prosecutor

but apparenty didn't want one for this case?


------

	Let me give you some examples. Representative Turner said, and I quote, “The investigation by the FBI is steeped in political bias,” end quote. Was your investigation steeped in political bias? Yes or no?

	COMEY: No. It was steeped in no kind of bias.


no bias? really?


------

	JORDAN: Do you see how someone could view the context of what she did, set up a private system, she alone controlled it, she kept everything on it? We now know from Ms. Abedin’s deposition they did it for that reason, so no one could see what was there based on the depositions Ms. Abedin gave. And then when they got caught, they deleted what they had and they scrubbed their devices. Is that part of the context in evaluating this decision?

	COMEY: Sure, sure. And I understand what inferences can be drawn from that set of facts, of course.


then why not reccomend indictment...

------

	DESANTIS: Why shouldn’t U.S. officials use mobile devices when traveling to foreign countries, especially if they’re discussing classifying or sensitive information?

	COMEY: Because the mobile device will transmit its signal across networks that are likely controlled or at least accessed by that hostile power.


a problem she sent that classified email from Russia, then

------

	DESANTIS: And those were things that were originated by Secretary Clinton’s aides and sent to her, which would obviously be in her server, but it was also included Secretary Clinton originating those e-mails, correct?

	COMEY: That’s correct.

	In most circumstances, it initiated with aides starting the conversation. In the one involving top secret information, Secretary Clinton not only received but sent e-mails talking about the same subject.

	DESANTIS: And of that top secret information you found, would somebody who is sophisticated in those matters, should it have been obvious to them that was sensitive information?

	COMEY: Yes.

	DESANTIS: So I guess my issue about knowledge of what you’re doing is, in order for Secretary Clinton to have access to top secret, SCI FBI information, didn’t she have to sign a form with the State Department acknowledging her duties and responsibilities under the law to safeguard this information?

	COMEY: Yes. Anybody who gets access to SCI, Sensitive Compartmented Information would sign a read-in form that lays that out. I’m sure members of Congress have seen the same thing.


Comey confirming the "play dumb" defense is all she had


	DESANTIS: And it stresses in that document and other training people would get, that there are certain requirements to handling certain levels of information. For example, a top secret document, that can’t even be on your secret system at the FBI, correct?

	COMEY: Correct.

	DESANTIS: So you have to follow certain guidelines. And I guess my question is, is she’s very sophisticated person, she did execute that document, correct?

	COMEY: Yes.

------

	DESANTIS: So the question is, is very sophisticated, this is information that clearly anybody who had knowledge of security information would know that it would be classified? But I’m having a little bit of trouble to see, how would you not then know that that was something that was inappropriate to do?

	COMEY: Well, I just want to take one of your assumptions about sophistication. I don’t think that our investigation established she was actually particularly sophisticated with respect to classified information and the levels and treatment, and so far as we can tell…


confirming "play dumb" defense

	DESANTIS: Isn’t she in an original classification of authority?

	COMEY: Yes, sir.

	DESANTIS: Good grief.


------

	CLAY: In your opinion, do the mistakes Secretary Clinton has already apologized for and expressed regret for, rise to a level that would be worthy of federal prosecution?

	COMEY: As I said Tuesday, our judgment, not just mine, but the team’s judgment at the FBI is that the Justice Department would not bring such a case. No Justice Department would under any –whether Republican or Democrat administration.


comey pre-judging case, basically saying he thinks she's innocent


------

	She had to have known about this statute because she had to have been briefed when she took over the job as the Secretary of State. So how, given that body of knowledge and experience, could this have happened in a way that could have potentially provided access by hackers to confidential information?

	COMEY: You know, it’s a good question. A reasonable question.

	The protection we have as Americans is that the government in general and in that statute in particular, has to prove before they can prosecute any of us, that we did this thing that’s forbidden by the law. And when we did it, we knew we were doing something that was unlawful. We don’t have to know the code number, but that we knew we were doing something that was unlawful. That’s the protection we have, one I have worked for very hard.


manufacturing intent requirement

did Comey apply this idea uniformly? (nevermind that it's obviously wrong)

------

	MEADOWS: So a reasonable person who has been a Senator, a Secretary of State, a First Lady, wouldn’t a reasonable person know that that was a classified marking? As a secretary of state, a reasonable person? That’s all I’m asking.

	COMEY: Before this investigation, I probably would have said, yes. I’m not so sure. I don’t find it incredibly…

	MEADOWS: Director Comey, come on.

	I mean, I have only been here a few years and I understand the importance of those markings. So you’re suggesting that a long length of time that she had no idea what a classified marking would be? That’s your sworn testimony today?

	COMEY: No, no, not that she would have no idea what a classified marking would be, but it’s an interesting question as to — the question about sophistication came up earlier — whether she was sophisticated enough to understand what a “c” means.


more of the "playing dumb" defense

Comey suggests Clinton was too dumb to know what a "C" means



	COMEY: That’s not what I said.

	MEADOWS: That’s a huge statement.

	COMEY: That’s not what I said. You asked me did I assume someone would know. Probably before the investigation, I would have, I’m not so sure of that answer any longer. I think it’s possible — possible that she didn’t understand what a “c” meant when she saw it in the body of the e-mail like that.


Comey says "possible," but if she did she forwarded to unclass email...


	MEADOWS: After years in the Senate and Secretary of State, I mean, that’s hard for me and the American people to believe, Director Comey. And I’m not questioning your analysis of it, but wouldn’t a reasonable person think that someone who has the highest job of handling classified information would understand that?

	COMEY: I think that’s the conclusion a reasonable person would draw. It may not be accurate…


so what conclusion would a "reasonable proseuctor" draw?

------

	DUNCAN: Right. And it also is accurate that, quote, “Clinton’s lawyers cleaned their devices in such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery.”

	COMEY: Correct.


Comey confirms Clinton lawyers wiped her laptop


------

	DUNCAN: Well, do you understand as the chairman said earlier, that great numbers of people feel now that there’s one standard of justice for the Clintons and another for regular people?

	COMEY: Yeah, I’ve heard that a lot. It’s not true, but I’ve heard it a lot.


Comey implying everything was fine about the investigation?


------

	DUNCAN: Do you — we talk about gross negligence here and you said that Secretary Clinton was extremely careless with this classified material and how dangerous it could be, how threatening to — even to people’s lives that it could be to disclose classified material.

Do you agree that there is a very thin line between gross negligence and extreme carelessness? And would you explain to me what you consider to be that difference?

	COMEY: Sure, judge — Congressman. As a former judge, you know there isn’t actually a great definition in the law of gross negligence. Some courts interpret it as close to willful, which means you know you’re doing something wrong.

	Others drop it lower. My term (ph) extremely careless is trying to be kind of an ordinary person. That’s a common-sense way of describing it; it sure looks real careless to me.

	The question of whether that amounts to gross negligence frankly is really not at the center of this because when I look at the history of the prosecutions and see, it’s been one case brought on a gross negligence theory.

	I know from 30 years there’s no way anybody from the Department Of Justice is bringing a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts.


more pre-judging case and inserting intent requirement

------

	DUNCAN: You ended your statement to Congressman Cooper a while ago saying no — saying once again that no reasonable prosecutor could have brought this case, yet you also mentioned earlier today that you had seen several of your friends and other prosecutors who have said publicly, many across this country, they would have been glad to prosecute this case.

	COMEY: I smile because they’re friends and I haven’t talked to them I want to say, guys, so where were ya over the last 40 years?

	Where were these cases? They just have not been brought for reasons that I said earlier. It’s a good thing the Department Of Justice worries about prosecuting people for being careless. I don’t like it.

	As a citizen, I want people to show they knew they were breaking the law and then we’ll put you in jail.


Comey implies everything is fine about the case

	CONNOLLY: Was she evasive?

	COMEY: I don’t think the agents assessed she was evasive.


the 302 is basically dripping with it...


------


	COMEY: It takes mishandling it and criminal intent.

	HURD: And so an unauthorized server in the basement is not mishandling?

	COMEY: Well, no, there is evidence of mishandling here. This whole investigation at the end focused on is there sufficient evidence of intent.

	HURD: Were — was this unanimous opinion within the FBI on your decision?

	COMEY: The whole FBI wasn’t involved, but the team of agents, investigators, analysts, technologists, yes.


Comey says the intent requirement was big part of the case


also confirms there is evidence of mishandling



------

	HURD: Director Comey, I’m not a lawyer, and so I may misstate this. Is there such a thing as the case of first impression, and why was this not possibly one of those?

	COMEY: There is such a thing, which just means the first time you do something. The reason this isn’t one of those is that’s just not fair. That would be treating somebody differently because of their celebrity status or because of some other factor that doesn’t matter. We have to treat people — the bedrock of our system of justice, we treat people fairly, we treat them the same based on their…

	HURD: And that person mishandling the most sensitive information that this government can collect is — is not fair? It’s not fair to punish someone who did that?

	COMEY: Not on these facts. If would be fair — if that person worked for me, it would be fair to have a robust disciplinary proceeding. It’s not fair to prosecute that person on these facts.


Comey dodges the "case of first impression" question, once again says everything is fine

"it's not fair to prosecute someone on these facts"

this seems like a "case of first impression," I mean can't find anything like it

and important, since its basically a legal mole in the state department

but Comey says "not a case of first impression because that's just not fair"

how does that make sense? he's dodging the question


------

	And I want to give you a chance, Director Comey, how do you respond to that? How important to you is maintaining your integrity before the nation?

	COMEY: I think the only two things I have in life that matter are the love of my family and friends and my integrity. So I care deeply about both.


Comey loves his friends, integrity, "only two things I have in life tat matter"

what about justice? America?

Russia? Putin?

Maybe Putin is his friend

------

	CARTWRIGHT: All right. Now Director Comey, you discussed your team a little bit and they deserve a lot of credit for all of the hard work and effort that went into this investigation. And I think you just said that they were unanimous that everyone who looked at this agreed that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case. Am I correct in that?

	COMEY: Yes.

	CARTWRIGHT: How many people were on this team?

	COMEY: It changed at various times, but somewhere between 15 and 20. Then we used a lot of other FBI folks to help from time to time.


Comey says he wasn't the only one deciding "no reasonable prosecutor" would bring a case


------

	CARTWRIGHT: Was there a header on the three documents that we’ve discussed today that had the little “c” in the text someplace?

	COMEY: No. They were three e-mails. The “c” was in the body, in the text, but there was no header on the e-mail or in the text.

	CARTWRIGHT: So if Secretary Clinton really were an expert at what’s classified and what’s not classified and were following the manual, the absence of a header would tell her immediately that those three documents were not classified. Am I correct in that?

	COMEY: That would be a reasonable inference.


Comey says Clinton could infer the email wasn't classified because there was no header

but that's not what she said...

------

	BUCK: And do — did hostile nations obtain classified information from Secretary Clinton’s servers?

	COMEY: I don’t know. It’s possible, but we don’t have direct evidence of that. We couldn’t find direct evidence.


FBI looked for "direct evidence" server hacked


------


	BUCK: And there is no doubt about those two elements. Now I don’t know whether the next element is one element or two, but it talks about knowingly removed such materials without authority and with the intent to retain such material at an unauthorized location.

	So I’m going to treat those as two separate parts of the intent element. First of all, do you see the word “willfully” anywhere in this statute?

	COMEY: I don’t.

	BUCK: And that would indicate to you that there is a lower threshold for intent?

	COMEY: No, it wouldn’t.

	BUCK: Why?

	COMEY: Because we often — as I understand, the Justice Department’s practice and judicial practice will impute to any criminal statute at that level with a knowingly also requirement that you know that you’re involved in criminal activity of some sort. A general mens rea requirement.


Comey says "knowingly" implies a "general mens rea" intent requirement


------


	BUCK: And she knew that she was receiving materials, classified information, in — in the e-mails that she received on — on her BlackBerry and other devices.

	COMEY: I can’t answer — I’m hesitating as a prosecutor because it’s always — to what level of proof. I do not believe there’s evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that she knew she was receiving classified information in violation of the requirements.


"playing dumb" again

so this is important to the case: that wasn't evidence that she knew, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she was receiving classified information


------

	BUCK: Okay. And did she then have the intent to retain such material at an unauthorized location? She retained the material that she received as secretary of state at her server in her basement and that was unauthorized.

	COMEY: You’re asking me did she have the — I’m going to ask you the burden of proof question in a second. But did she have the intent to retain classified information on the server or just to retain any information on the server?


Is that really how 793 (f) is supposed to work?

is that what Comey has in mind here?


sounds like he's talking about 1924


	COMEY: She did in fact  — there is, in my view, not evidence beyond certainly probable cause. There’s not evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that she knew she was receiving classified information or that she intended to retain it on her server.


------


	WALBERG: ...The question I have from that, would it be difficult for any Cabinet- level official — specifically, any Cabinet official, let alone one who is a former White House resident or U.S. Senator, to determine if information is classified?

	COMEY: Would fit be difficult?

	WALBERG: Would it be difficult?

	COMEY: That’s hard to answer in the abstract. It would depend upon the context in which they are hearing it or seeing it. Obviously, if it’s marked, which is why we require markings, it’s easy.


but it was marked...


------


	WALBERG: So Secretary Clinton’s revised statement she never knowingly sent or received any classified information is probably also untrue.

	COMEY: Yeah, I don’t want to comment on people’s public statements.

	We did not find evidence sufficient to establish that she knew she was sending classified information beyond a reasonable doubt to meet the intent standard.

	Like I said, I understand why people are confused by the whole discussion. I get that. But you know what would be a double standard? If she were prosecuted for gross negligence.


Ok, so Comey makes it pretty clear here I think? added intent requirement, and the requirement was that she knew she was sending classified info


------


	In this case, did you apply the law fairly, equally regardless of politics?

	COMEY: Yes.

	LIEU: Did you get any political interference from the White House?

	COMEY: None.

	LIEU: Did you get any political interference from the Hillary Clinton campaign?

	COMEY: None.


no "political interference" from White House or HRC campaign


------



	LIEU: So of those three e-mails, one one-hundredth of 1 percent of 30,000, they bore these tiny little classified markings which is, as you describe, a “c” with parentheses. Correct?

	COMEY: Correct.

	LIEU: It’s certainly (ph) possible that a busy person who has sent and received over 30,000 e-mails just might miss this marking of a “c” with parentheses. It is possible, correct?

	COMEY: Correct.


Ted Lieu acting as HRC defense lawyer--says she could have just missed the marking

which would be very...negligent of her


but Lieu saying perhaps not grossly negligent


it would have to be the setting up of the server itself then I guess?


------


	MICA: You did. And did you — you said you didn’t talk to all of the agents. But all of the agents, did they meet with you and then is that the group that said that we all vote to not recommend prosecution?

	COMEY: I did not meet with all of the agents. I’ve met with — I guess I’ve — I’ve met with all of them…


Comey did not meet with all the agents before deciding not to prosecute

I thought he said it was unanimous? "no reasonable prosecutor" would bring the case?


------

	PLASKETT: And did anyone with Secretary Clinton’s campaign or the administration influence your recommendation for political reasons?

	COMEY: No, they didn’t influence it in any way.


Comey I think saying here that he wasn't pressured to not prosecute?

talking about direct influence?


------

	COMEY: There were unsuccessful attempts. I don’t know the number off top of my head.

	FARENTHOLD: Do you have an idea — were they from foreign governments? Where’d they come from?

	COMEY: I want to be careful what I say in an open setting and so I — we can give you that information but I don’t want to give the — any foreign governments knowledge of what I know, so there…


then why release the 302 with the Russian question?


seems fairly clear they were trying to build the case Russia hacked her, right?


------

	Had you, after your thorough investigation, found evidence that suggested that criminal conduct occurred, is there anything, anything or anyone that could have held you back from deciding to prosecute?

	COMEY: No. I mean I — I don’t have the power to decide prosecution but I worked very hard to make sure that a righteous case was prosecuted.

	WELCH: And you would have made that recommendation to the Attorney General?

	COMEY: Yes.

	WELCH: Was there any interference, implicit or explicit, from the President of the United States or anyone acting on his behalf to influence the outcome of your investigation and the recommendation that you made?

	COMEY: No.

	WELCH: Was there anyone in the Hillary Clinton campaign, or Hillary Clinton herself, who did anything directly or indirectly to attempt to influence the conclusion that you made to recommend no prosecution?

	COMEY: No


Comey once again--everything is fine, no interference from President or Clinton


------

	BLUM: In August of last year, Secretary Clinton was asked by Ed Henry of Fox News whether she had wiped her entire server, meaning that, did she delete all the e-mails on here server? Her response, “you mean with a cloth?” March of 2015, during a press conference, Secretary Clinton assured us that her private e-mail server was secure saying, “the server was on private property guarded by the Secret Service.”

	Now, this would have laughable if it wasn’t so serious. I know, you know, my constituents in eastern Iowa know, you don’t need to be a cat burglar to hack into an e-mail server and you don’t need a cloth to wipe a server clean. One would think that a former United States Senator, one would think that a Former Secretary of State would know this as well. Would you agree with that statement?

	COMEY: You would think, although as I said before, one of the things I learned in this case is that the Secretary may not have been as sophisticated as people assumed.

	She didn’t have a computer in her office at the State Department for example. I don’t think — so I would assume the same thing about someone who had been a Senator and a high-ranking official. I’m not sure it’s a fair assumption in this case.


"playing dumb" defense again

Comey makes it sound like he honestly believes it


------


http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-jokes-wiping-email-server-cloth/story?id=33165517
	 Hillary Clinton joked to reporters Tuesday in Las Vegas about whether she "wiped" her email server clean before giving it to the FBI.

	“What? Like with a cloth or something?” she asked, then laughed. “I don’t know how it works digitally at all.” 




	COMEY: I would assume it was a facetious comment about a cloth. I don’t know a particular on that one.

	BLUM: Would you also assume Director, that Secretary Clinton knew that a server could be wiped clean electronically, that it could be hacked electronically, not physically? You don’t need a cat burglar to hack a server. Would you assume — is reasonable to assume she knows that?

	COMEY: To some level she would know that. To some level of understanding.


well she did the 2010 cybersecurity PSA...


------


	My question to you today: Do you feel like this has been a Republican witch hunt, this hearing?

	COMEY: No. I said from the beginning, I understand people’s questions and interest. I’m a huge fan of transparency. I think that’s what makes our democracy great.


then tell, say, the country that hacked her emails, or what "mischeif" Russia is up to


------

	COMEY: I think so, but I can’t — I can’t remember specifically.

	DESJARLAIS: OK.

	COMEY: It’s a very long, 302. I’d have to check and then get back to you.

	DESJARLAIS: OK. And we’ll get access to that.

	Do you know if they asked her when she said that there was nothing marked classified on my e-mails sent or received?

	COMEY: Same answer. I’m not sure.


Why is he so fuzzy on the 302 when he decided not to prosecute two days earlier?


didn't even consult with his whole team either


------

	DESJARLAIS: OK. I guess my point is, you’re trying to get inside the head of Hillary Clinton in this investigation and know whether there was intent. And so we all know what she told the people. That has been well-documented.

	She said that she did not do those things, that she did not send or receive classified e-mails, that she used one server and one device for her convenience.

	And since then, I think even in your statement, you recognize that those were not correct. Is that fair?

	COMEY: I really don’t want to get in the business of trying to parse and judge her public statements. And so I think I’ve tried to avoid doing that sitting here.


Comey doesn't want to "parse and judge" Clinton's public statements... why not?

	DESJARLAIS: Why do you feel that’s important?

	COMEY: Because what matters to me is what did she say to the FBI. That’s obviously first and foremost for us.

	DESJARLAIS: Right


------

	COMEY: Yes, I think that’s fair, actually — no, not as people thought, but as people would assume about somebody with that background.

	DESJARLAIS: OK. So…

	COMEY: I’m sorry. I should be clear about this. Technically sophisticated. I’m not opining on other kinds of sophistication.


??? what is he talking about sophistcated as in knowing how technology works?

What about sophistication as in knowing what should be classified and what should not?

he spoke about her "sophistication" in the context of the portion markings iirc


------

	LUJAN GRISHAM: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

	I’ve had the benefit of — when you’re last to — or nearly last, to really have both the benefit and then to question the kinds of statements and the dialogue back and forth.

	And where I’m settled at this point in time is in a couple of places, but particularly, I don’t think there’s any member in this committee, or quite frankly any member in Congress who doesn’t both want and expect that the FBI and the Department of Justice to be — to operate in a fair, unbiased, and highly independent manner.

	Otherwise, you can’t appropriately uphold or enforce federal law. And while we’ve all — this has been stated in a couple of different ways, I’m going to see if we can’t — I want to get direct answers.

	So, Mr. Comey, is there any evidence, given that that’s the standard that we all want, desire, and expect, to suggest that Hillary Clinton was not charged by the Department of Justice due to inappropriate political influence or due to her current or previous public positions?

	COMEY: Zero. And if there is such evidence, I’d love folks to show it to me.


Comey again saying everything is fine


------


	First of all, did I understand you correctly that your decision, that this decision was made within 3 and 1/2 hours of — of an interview, and that was all?

	COMEY: No, we investigated it for a year.


interesting didn't know it was 3.5 hours after the interview

	CARTER: You investigate, but you interviewed her for 3 and 1/2 hours last week and then came to the conclusion?

	COMEY: Correct. We interviewed her on Saturday for 3 and 1/2 hours, the last step in a year-long investigation.

or not


------


	CARTER: Than why didn’t they say something? Don’t they have a responsibility as well?

	COMEY: That’s an important question that goes to the culture of the State Department that’s worth asking.


state department working for KGB


------

	CHAFFETZ: My understanding, Director, is that you offered him immunity. Why did you offer him immunity and what did you get for it?

	COMEY: You know, that I have to — I’m not sure what I can talk about in open setting about that.

	CHAFFETZ: Well, he’s not going to be prosecuted, so…

	COMEY: Right, but I — I want to be careful. I’m doing this 24 hours after the investigation closed. I want to be thoughtful, because we’re — we’re as you know, big about the law, that I’m following the law about what I disclose about that. So I’ll have to get back to you on that one. I don’t want to answer that off the cuff.


interesting, why can't Comey answer about Pagliano?

and so much for "transparency"...


------

	MULVANEY: Thank you gentleman. Director Comey, earlier today you heard a long list of statements that Ms. Clinton has made previously, both to the public and to Congress that were not factually accurate.

	I think you went down the whole long list. When she met with you folks on Saturday last week, I take it she didn’t say the same things at that interview?

	COMEY: I’m not equipped sitting here without the 302 in front of me to answer in that broad…

	MULVANEY: But it’s your — it’s your testimony…

	COMEY: But I have no basis — we do not have a basis for concluding she lied to the FBI.


Comey once again unfamiliar with 302 even after he just basically personally cleared HRC


	MULVANEY: Would that have been of interest to you in helping to establish intent?

	COMEY: It could have been, sure


well that's a good point, huh?

although according to Comey, he doesn't care about HRC's public statements, he cares about whe she says to the FBI


------


	MULVANEY: Were you aware that just earlier this week, her — her assistant actually said it was for an entirely different reason? It was to — it was to keep emails from being accessible, and that it was for concealment purpose. So she was — Huma Abedin was asked in her deposition why it was set up.

	And it was said, to keep her personal emails from being accessible. To the question, to whom? To anybody. Where you aware of that testimony?

	COMEY: Generally, yes.


Mulvaney building the case for criminal intent


------

	MULVANEY: Does it bother you that the precedent that you are setting today, may well lead to a circumstance where our top secret information continues to be exposed to our potential enemies?

	COMEY: No, in this sense, the precedent that I’m setting today is my absolute best effort to treat people fairly without regard to who they are. If that continues to be the record of the FBI and Justice Department, that’s what it should be.


Comey seems to be fine with interpreting the law in a way that risks national security to be "fair" to HRC


-------

	GOWDY: Thank you Doctor Gosar. Director Comey, I want to go back to the issue of intent for just a second. We could disagree on whether or not it’s an element of the offense, let’s assume for the sake of argument, that you’re right and I’m wrong and that it is an element of the offense.

	Secretary Clinton said that she was, “Well aware of classification requirements”. Those are her words, not mine and not yours. So if she were, “Well aware of classification requirements”, how did that impact your analysis of her intent? Because I’ve heard you this morning, describe her as being less than sophisticated. She disagrees with that.

	COMEY: Well, I was talking about technical sophistication. The question is, I would hope everybody who works in the Government is aware of classification requirements. The question then is, if you mishandle classified information, when you did that thing, did you know you were doing something that was unlawful? That’s the intent question.


First Comey says that if it was proved a forign gov hacked her emails it wouldn't change anything, now says he was talking about "intent" w.r.t "technical sophistication"


So is he trying to say H.R.C. didn't know her emails could be hacked? an that was the missing "intent?"


------

	GOWDY: All right, well you and I are going to have to get together some other time and discuss all the people we prosecuted who were unaware that they were breaking the law. That, there are lots of really dumb defendants out there, who don’t know that what they’re doing is against the law. But let’s go with what you say …

	COMEY: I disagree. I, you may have prosecuted a lot of those folks. I did not prosecute all those folks.


Does Comey honestly think people who don't know they are breaking the law can't break the law? manslaughter is legal? speeding without knowing it is legal?


also, did Martha Stewart know she was breaking the law?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImClone_stock_trading_case
	Although Stewart maintained her innocence, she was found guilty and sentenced on July 16, 2004 to five months in prison, five months of home confinement, and two years probation for lying about a stock sale, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice.

hmmm

probably decently big charges for something like that? idk

but was Comey as "fair" to Martha Stewart?


--------


	GOWDY: I was a gunner prosecutor and you were a white collar prosecutor. Trust me, there, there are lots of people who don’t know you can’t kill other people. Let me ask you this, on the issue of intent, you say it was convenience, okay? You’re a really smart lawyer, if it were convenience Director, she wouldn’t have waited two years to return the documents and she wouldn’t have deleted them four years after they were created.

	So you can’t really believe that her intent was convenience when she never turned them over until Congress started asking for them, could you?

	COMEY: Yeah my focus, and I hope I made this clear, my focus is on, what was the thinking around the classified information. I mean it’s relevant why the system was set up and the thinking there. But she didn’t, I don’t understand her to be saying, we’ll I think I’ve said it already, that, that’s my focus.


Gowdy building case of criminal intent. Saying she must have known her setup was inconvenient

although perhaps not if she really was that "technically unsophisticated"


wait now is Comey saying the "intent requirement" he's looking for is in knowing the information was classified?

which is it?

its like he keeps changing his story

------

	COMEY: I enjoyed, I enjoyed talking with him. The, the question you’ve got to ask is, why is it that the Department of Justice, since 1917, has not used that gross negligence statute for charging at once in an espionage case. And whether their decision was smart or not, that is the record of fairness.

	And so you have to decide, do I treat this person against that record? And if I do, is that a fair thing to do? Even if you’re not worried about the constitutionality of it, and my judgment is, no reasonable prosecutor would do that. That would be celebrity hunting. That will be treating this person differently than John Doe.


Comey ignoring that this case is different from any prior / "case of first impression"


-------


	GROTHMAN: OK next question. Just for the listening audience, here. At first when I hear about erasing e-mails I think it’s like you know, like on my phone where I might erase an auto insurance solicitation.

	The erasers here, however, were not just Mrs. Clinton pressing delete. Or they — there was a much greater effort made to make sure that these e-mails would never be recovered. Do you want to comment on what was done to erase the e-mails?

	COMEY: I think what you’re referring to is after her lawyers — her lawyers say — although I don’t — I’m not able to verify this. There were 60,000 or so left at the end of 2014.

	They went through them in a way I described in my statement two days ago and then they produced the ones that were work related and then they erased from their system the ones that were not work related. That was done using technical tools basically to remove them from lawyers — from the servers to wipe them away.


Comey makes it sound better than it is I think? the lawyers didn't consult Clinton on how to delete (according to Clinton), and said they only searched for "Bengazi" or something to find work-related emails

------

	GROTHMAN: Do you think Mrs. Clinton knew that the technical people were erasing these e-mails so that even your top technical experts could recover them?

	COMEY: Based on my sense now for technical sophistication, I — I — I don’t think so.


Comey honestly thinks Clinton is technological idiot


------

	GROTHMAN: What type of lawyer wouldn’t tell their client they were doing that? But…

	COMEY: I don’t think — I think — I think our evidence — our investigation is they did not. That they asked her, do you want to keep them and they said no and they said wipe them away.


wtf is Comey saying? need to see original

If they found out that the lawyers did consult Clinton then that means she lied to FBI, no?


------

	GROTHMAN: I’m sorry, when you go to this length to make sure you can never recover the e-mails who are erased, wouldn’t you think the intent is to make sure nobody looks at them again?

	Why — why — otherwise, couldn’t you just (inaudible).

	CHAFFETZ: I thank the gentleman. We’ll give the director time to — if he wants to respond.

	COMEY: I guess it’s a bit circular. You delete because you want to delete. But that — that — what I mean is we didn’t find any evidence of evil intent and intent to obstruct justice.

	GROTHMAN: You wouldn’t have been able to because you don’t know what was deleted.


yeah I don't get how that's not obstruction of justice

emails she didn't turn over kept turning up too (for like what, a year?)

is the cover that she cared about privacy, since they were "perosnal" emails?

------

	CHAFFETZ: Thank you, I think if you yield back, through mutual agreement Mr. Cummings and I have agreed that I do have about a dozen or so quick follow up questions.

	You have been most generous with your time but I would like to get through this last bit and again, we’ll do so with equal time. How did the Department of Justice, or how did the FBI view the incident in which Hillary Clinton instructed Jake Sullivan to take the markings off of a document that was to be sent to her?

	COMEY: Yes, we looked at that pretty closely. There was some problem with their secure fax machine and there was an e-mail in which she says in substance, take the headers off of it and send it as a non- paper and as we’ve dug into that more deeply, we’ve come to learn that at least this one view of it that is reasonable, that a non-paper in State Department parlance (ph) means a document that contains things we could pass to another government. So essentially take out anything that’s classified and send it to me. Now it turned out that didn’t happen, we actually found that the classified fax was then sent, but that’s our best understanding of what that was about.

	CHAFFETZ: So this was a classified fax?

	COMEY: Correct.

	CHAFFETZ: So Hillary Clinton sends to Jake Sullivan, Jake — well let me go back, Jake Sullivan says they say they had issues sending secure fax, they’re working on it. Hillary Clinton sends to Jake Sullivan, if they can’t, turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send non-secure. So you’re telling me it’s a classified piece of information, she’s taking off the header and she’s instructing them to send it in a non-secure format. Is that not intent?

	COMEY: Well that actually caught my attention when I first saw it and what she explained to us in her interview was, and other witnesses too as well, is what she meant by that is make it into a non-classified document, that’s what a non-paper is in their world, and send it to us because I don’t need the classified stuff I just need the…

	CHAFFETZ: Then why take off the heading if it’s going to be turned into a non-classified document, why take off the heading?

	COMEY: I assume because it would be non-classified anymore so you wouldn’t have a classified header on it. Because what she said during her interview…

	CHAFFETZ: Because she wanted to be technically correct, is that what you’re saying, that you’re…

	COMEY: No, I think what she said during the interview is I was telling him in essence, send the unclassified document, take the header off, turn it into a non-paper, which is a term I had never heard before but I’m told by people I credit that in diplomatic circles something we can pass to another government…

	CHAFFETZ: You are very generous in your accepting of that


------

	CHAFFETZ: But how can that — there’s no intent there, does she not understand that these people don’t have security clearances?

	COMEY: Surely she understands at least some of them don’t have security clearances.

	CHAFFETZ: So she understands they don’t have security clearances and it’s reasonable to think she’s going to be in (ph) classified information. Is that not intent to provide a non-cleared person access to classified information?

	COMEY: You’re mixing it up though. I don’t think it’s reasonable to assume — mixing me up, sorry, not your fault — that someone who is maintaining your server is reading your e-mails, in fact I don’t think that’s the case here. There’s a separate thing which is when she is engaging counsel (ph) to comply with the State Department’s request, are her lawyers then exposed information that may be on there that’s classified, so…

	CHAFFETZ: And did they see any classified information? Did Hillary Clinton’s attorneys, without security clearances, see classified information?

	COMEY: As (ph) I sit here, I don’t know the answer to that.

	CHAFFETZ: It has to be yes Director, you came across 110 and they said they went through all of them.

	COMEY: Well, they didn’t read them all they just looked at headings (ph)…

	CHAFFETZ: So their excuse is we saw the e-mails but we didn’t read them?


right, handing her lawyers the classified emails sounds illegal too


I guess that's why the have the "search term" cover thing

dunno if that helps, they still obviously had access to them, no?


------

	CHAFFETZ: They — did Hillary Clinton give non-cleared people access to classified information?

	COMEY: Yes. Yes.

	CHAFFETZ: What do you think her intent was?

	COMEY: I think then was to get good legal representation and to make the production to the State Department. That can be a very tall order, in that circumstance (ph) I don’t see the evidence there to make a case that she was acting with criminal intent in her engagement with her lawyers.

	CHAFFETZ: And I’d just — I guess I read criminal intent as the idea that you allow somebody without a security clearance access to classified information. Everybody knows that Director, everybody knows that. I’ve gone way past my time, let me recognize Mr. Cummings for an equal amount of time.


Chaffetz says: She intedned to give some uncleared access to classified information, which is criminal intent

Comey seems to think you have to think you're doing something wrong to break the law?

but even then Chaffetz says "everybody knows" youre not supposed to give uncleared access to classified


Comey's answer sounds stupid


------


	CHAFFETZ: Thank you gentlemen. Who was Hillary Clinton e- mailing that was hacked?

	COMEY: Yes I don’t want to say in open forum. We can get you that information, but again, I don’t want to give any hostile adversaries insight into who — what we figured out.


was Sid Blumenthal iirc?

why is Comy mum on this?


------


	CHAFFETZ: Understood, understood. Was there any evidence of Hillary Clinton attempting to avoid compliance with the Freedom of Information Act?

	COMEY: That was not the subject of our criminal investigation, so I can’t answer that sitting here.

	CHAFFETZ: It’s a violation of law, is it not?

	COMEY: Yes, my understanding is there are civil statutes that apply to that. I don’t know…
	
	CHAFFETZ: So let’s put the boundaries on this a little bit. What you didn’t look at. You didn’t look at whether or not there was an intention or the reality of non-compliance with the Freedom of Information Act?

	COMEY: Correct.

	CHAFFETZ: You did not look at testimony that Hillary Clinton gave in the United State Congress, both the House and the Senate.

	COMEY: To see whether it was precarious in some respect?

	CHAFFETZ: Yes.

	COMEY: No we did not.


let her off on other crimes? Didn't they ask her about doding FOIA? (or was that to establish intent?)


------


	CHAFFETZ: Did you review and look at those transcripts as to the intent of your recommendation.

	COMEY: I’m sure my folks did. I did not.


Comey didn't even look at Clinton tesimony before deciding she was innocent


------


	CHAFFETZ: No it was the Inspector General that initiated this. Did the fact that Hillary Clinton refused to be interviewed by the Inspector General, what did that say to you about intent?

	COMEY: At least for our criminal investigation, not particularly germane.


sounds more like she knew she was doing something wrong


------

	CHAFFETZ: Are you familiar — you’re familiar there’s a website, I mean lots of government agencies have a website. The State Department has a website; state.gov. And they have a YouTube site. Videos that are uploaded to a YouTube site, would those be considered Federal Records?
[14:30:05] COMEY: I don’t know.

	CHAFFETZ: So they’re paid for by federal dollars. They’re maintained by federal employees. Would that not be a federal record?

	CHAFFETZ: Yeah I just don’t know. I’m sure there’s an expert who can answer that in two seconds but I’m not that expert.


what is Chaffetz talking about?

Clinton testimoney on state dep youtube site maybe?

------

	CHAFFETZ: Did you look at the Clinton Foundation?

	COMEY: I’m not going to comment on the existence or nonexistence of any other investigations.

	CHAFFETZ: Was the Clinton Foundation tied into this investigation?

	COMEY: Yeah I’m not going to answer that.


seems like it was? this might have helped fuel the conspiracy theories about Clinton foundation being under an investigation so immense it would "take down the entire government"


if that's true it would have given Comey a lot of power actually


said where State dep ends and Foundation begins is hard to see, massive quid-pro-quo scandals


so the country was already fucked maybe, basically agent provacture of the entire government

all started by one little FOIA request


basically, the right FOIA reuqest can bring down the entire government


------

	LYNCH: crackers with attitude had hacked 9,000 employees’ data 


actually it was over 9,000


------


	PEREZ: ...He says there’s only been one time that that statute has been used that way in 99 years, and that was for an espionage case. Clearly did not rise to the level to prosecute Hillary Clinton — Wolf?

thougth that was what he was saying, Perez corraborates


------

	BLITZER: No doubt about that. She definitely liked what she heard from the FBI director, even though he continued to insist that she was extremely careless over those four years in handling sensitive information on the private e-mail server.


helping set-up the whole "justice department rigged for hillary" Russian propaganda narrative


------

	CUMMINGS: Yeah, three out of 30,000-some. And they had a small “C,” and apparently it was just a mistake, that they were not classified, and they did not have six or seven things, headers on the pages, that would have notified somebody that they were in fact classified.

	But I think the thing that also concerns me is that Republicans want this drum beat to continue. They’re now talking about doing a referral with regard to her testimony before the Congress. And this again is that same old political game. That is trying to bring down Hillary Rodham Clinton by any means necessary. 


Cummings falling on his sword for queen hillary, politicizing everything

this might have helped set up the partisan fights in congress? clinton and trump extremely polarizing


both also would have severed relationship between USIC and Congress


basically get everyone angry and hate Congress


although maybe you should, since Congress might be mostly Russian spies (e.g. Cummings)


but if it ends up with USIC especially going rouge, like an intelligence coup, Russia could have Congress crack down on USIC and say this is an abuse of power by rouge intelligence agencies or something


problem is that USIC is far more popular than Congress-everybody hates Congress

Clinton: oh if this is not classified send to reporters

why is that even a question she would have to ask?

and why could she recognize this info as potentially classified, but apparently not all the other info she discussed (e.g. drone strikes)

then she says "didn't know it was classified"

hiding some work emails, failing to turn them over at all at first--maybe evdience of intent?


------

http://archive.is/2016.07.19-143208/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/03/10/transcript-hillary-clinton-addresses-e-mails-iran/

	There are four things I want the public to know.

	First, when I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.

	Looking back, it would've been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue.


did it not seem like an issue later when she started getting warnings that this wasn't allowed anymore/is extremely risky?

	Second, the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.


Clinton says some of her work emails didn't go to state.gov email addresses


	Third, after I left office, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work- related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related,


didn't she take like a year?


	which totalled roughly 55,000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them. We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work- related emails and deliver them to the State Department.


how would she know? she said she wasn't involved in the process. "we" went through a process?


	At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.


what is this saying, that she director for the rest of her "non-work-related" emails to be deleted? "I chose"


	And it was my practice to communicate with State Department and other government officials on their .gov accounts so those e-mails would be automatically saved in the State Department system to meet recordkeeping requirements, and that, indeed, is what happened. 


didn't they find like 3K work emails between her and Huma on a non .gov account?


	QUESTION: Can you explain how you decided which of the personal e-mails to get rid of, how you got rid of them and when? And how you'll respond to questions about you being the arbiter of what you release? 


	CLINTON: ...In going through the e-mails, there were over 60,000 in total, sent and received. About half were work-related and went to the State Department and about half were personal that were not in any way related to my work. I had no reason to save them, but that was my decision because the federal guidelines are clear and the State Department request was clear.

	For any government employee, it is that government employee's responsibility to determine what's personal and what's work-related. I am very confident of the process that we conducted and the e-mails that were produced. 


but then she tells the FBI she wasn't involved in saying what's work-related and what's not


	CLINTON: Yes? QUESTION: Did you or any of your aides delete any government- related e-mails from your personal account? And what lengths are you willing to go to to prove that you didn't?

	Some people, including supporters of yours, have suggested having an independent arbiter look at your server, for instance.

	CLINTON: We did not. In fact, my direction to conduct the thorough investigation was to err on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related.


except she didn't...


https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/Nov04_2016/F-2016-07895_1-2IC4/DOC_0C06131656/C06131656.pdf


this email confirmed by FBI as not among the 30K Clinton team produced


apparetly huma has an @clintonemail.com account


but surely Clinton would know she would be discussing work-related things with Huma?

so why not include those correspondence?

	That is the responsibility of the individual and I have fulfilled that responsibility, and I have no doubt that we have done exactly what we should have done. When the search was conducted, we were asking that any email be identified and preserved that could potentially be federal records, and that's exactly what we did.

no you didn't


what is relationship between HRC and Huma? would she describe as work relationship or personal? both?

(apparently they are secret lesbian lovers or something... wasn't there an email showing they were super-tight or something)
(and she's also a KGB spy I guess)

so they are super tight but also Abadin worked for the state department

and they sent work-related emails to each other---thousands upon thousands


	And then separately, will any of this have any bearing or effect on your timing or decision about whether or not you run for president? Thank you.

	CLINTON: Well, the system we used was set up for President Clinton's office. And it had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches.


how would she know that...


	Secondly, under the Federal Records Act, records are defined as reported information, regardless of its form or characteristics, and in meeting the record keeping obligations, it was my practice to email government officials on their state or other .gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved.


https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2017-05-09%20FBI%20to%20CEG%20-%20Comey%20Testimony%20Supplement.pdf

hmm, so how did Abdein get these emails?

and why put them on Wiener's computer?

suspicious for Abedin

was it Comey who testified 3K work emails from Clinton to Abedin?


https://web.archive.org/web/20160611054547/http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/01/state-department-to-release-huma-abedin-email-trove-217588
	Unlike Clinton, Abedin had an official email account, but she was among senior officials asked to provide any work-related messages in their personal accounts after State officials became concerned that the agency did not have copies of all the official records it should.


ok, so Clinton alabi could be that she sent "work-related" to abedin on her official account, personal to clintonmeail account


except she didn't do that

so she has to play really dumb



https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/03/read-the-full-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey-in-which-he-discusses-clinton-email-investigation/?utm_term=.11fd481c19a6
	Somehow, her emails are being forwarded to Anthony Weiner, including classified information, by her assistant, Huma Abedin.


	QUESTION: Were you ever -- were you ever specifically briefed on the security implications of using -- using your own email server and using your personal address to email with the president?

	CLINTON: I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.

	So I'm certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.


clearly false, maybe not evidence of intent though unless you can show she knew she had classified material on her server

http://images.politico.com/global/2015/08/10/clintonjwatchdec080815.pdf

wait so she swears under oath on Aug 8 2015 that she gave all work-related to state

and also that abedin did government business on her clintonemail.com account

but her "direction" was to do shitty keword searches and also to only touch corresondence with .gov addresses

so she has to be a complete idiot or lying

she says, went "above and beyond" providing email, she knew gov business included on huma account, but didn't include that in what she turned over


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/1487/2015/08/14/clintons-top-two-aides-also-used-private-email-accounts-for-government-work/
	Clinton has argued that 90% or more of her emails would have been archived by the State Department since she communicated mostly with other State Department employees. But in fact less than one percent of emails were archived by the department during her tenure there, and she emailed Mills and Abedin more than anyone else. (The Washington Post, 11/9/2015)


so that seems like a false excuplatory statement, right?

------


so was Bengazi just a way to release Clinton's emails?

imagine it

- start terrorist attack in Bengazi
- Hillary covers up because she is corrupt
- Trey Gowdy stats Bengazi committee and asks for her emails
- emails released all over, chaos, FBI investigating, CLinton lying everywhere
- emails released slowly over the course of her entire campaign, new scandal every week
- Trump installed


all just a way to release all of Clinton's emails to install Trump


I think I said that earlier too


Clinton is just a free "install any puppet you want" card for the Russians

she is incredibly corrupt, and they would know they have all her emails to release to swing any election against her


could they use her again? Clinton 2020?


seems like something they would try and very much want to do

everybody would lose faith in America, including Americans

would basically be end of country for a long time

	The Associated Press reports that “The private email server running in [Clinton’s] home basement when she was secretary of state was connected to the Internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers, according to data and documents reviewed by the Associated Press. […] Experts said the Microsoft remote desktop service [used on the server] wasn’t intended for such use without additional protective measures, and was the subject of US government and industry warnings at the time over attacks from even low-skilled intruders.”

	According to the Los Angeles Times: “The crowd went wild. So did the Internet.”

	Jordan interrupts, “But I’m asking how — I’m asking how it was done. Was — did someone physically look at the 62,000 emails, or did you use search terms, date parameters? I want to know the specifics.”

	Clinton responds, “They did all of that, and I did not look over their shoulders, because I thought it would be appropriate for them to conduct that search, and they did.”

	Then Jordan asks, “Will you provide this committee — or can you answer today — what were the search terms?”

	Clinton answers, “The search terms were everything you could imagine that might be related to anything, but they also went through every single email.”

	When asked for more specifics, she says, “I asked my attorneys to oversee the process. I did not look over their shoulder. I did not dictate how they would do it. I did not ask what they were doing and how they made their determinations.”


so she says they went through every single email under oath, which was false

Clinton lied about when she started using her private server

State OIG report

http://www.thompsontimeline.com/2228/2016/05/12/over-120-additional-clinton-emails-are-publicly-released/
	Similarly, Clinton had not sought permission to use a private email server, and would not have received it if she had.

Clinton said "it was allowed"

	Clinton should have handed over copies of her work emails immediately upon stepping down in February 2013. Failure to do so violated department policies and the Federal Records Act. Instead, she provided only some work emails, and those only in December 2014, nearly two years later, after the Republican-led House Benghazi Committee began asking for some of her emails.

Didn't she say she turned them over "right away?"


	Clinton has claimed she effectively left copies of her emails with the State Department because she mainly emailed other department officials. However, the report says that was an inappropriate form of preservation. Additionally, four of her closest aides, whom she exchanged emails with most often, also made “extensive” use of personal email accounts, so none of those emails would have been preserved in State Department records just by being received by those aides.


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/category/clinton-email-server/timeline-short/page/7/

	However, on this day, a State Department inspector general’s report makes one portion of her testimony public. Mills was asked by the committee, “Was anyone consulted about Secretary Clinton exclusively using a personal email address for her work?”

	Mills replied, “I don’t recall that. If it did happen, I wasn’t part of that process. But I don’t believe there was a consultation around it, or at least there’s not one that I’m aware of…” 

Clinton never asked about it?


http://web.archive.org/web/20160629033135/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-doubles-email-scandal-allowed/story?id=39400634

	"I have talked about this for many, many months," she said. "I testified for 11 hours before the Benghazi committee. I have answered numerous questions. We have posted information on our website and the information that we had is out there. It’s been clearly public and my email use was widely known throughout the department, throughout the government, and I have provided all of my work related emails, and I’ve asked that they be made public." 


Clinton says she provided all her work related emails, which is a lie


------


http://www.thompsontimeline.com/category/clinton-email-server/timeline-short/page/7/

	Clinton’s testimony differs from the known facts in one important detail. She claims that she didn’t direct her lawyers (David Kendall, Cheryl Mill, and Heather Samuelson) to begin the sorting process until she was formally asked about her email records at the same time other former secretaries of states were. That took place on October 28, 2014. The sorted work-related emails were given to the State Department on December 5, 2014, a little over one month later. However, Samuelson, the Clinton lawyer who did most of the sorting, said in her FBI interview that the sorting process took “several months.”

not sure what that means

	Furthermore, it is known that after the State Department informally asked for Clinton’s emails, Samuelson was first given some of Clinton’s emails to sort (all of those involving .gov email addresses) in late July 2014, and then was given all of Clinton’s emails to complete the sorting in late September 2014.


what's up with that? saying in testimony that her lawyers met with State but Cliton didn't know about it too

list of CLinton "evolution" on email controversy

	 Clinton said in an interview with Fox News that the FBI said she had been "truthful" to the public. Her statement drew criticism because that is not what Director James Comey had said. (In fact, he described her handling of classified information as ”extremely careless,” though adding that there was no evidence she and her colleagues “intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information.”)

	Then, when Clinton was asked Aug. 6 on Fox about her “truthful” comment, she said she may have "short-circuited" her answer.

	"What, like with a cloth or something? No," she tells Fox News' Ed Henry when asked whether she intentionally wiped her personal emails from her server before turning it over to the State Department. Clinton replies, "I have no idea. That's why we turned it over."


wait, didn't she say some of her emails were deleted?

	At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.

	No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy.

	Second, the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses, which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.

	Third, after I left office, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work- related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totalled roughly 55,000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them. We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work- related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.

	CLINTON: Everybody in the department knew that I was e-mailing from a personal address. Hundreds of people knew it. People around the government knew it. And, uh, you know, that was what the practice had been and that's what I did, as well.

	 DAVID MUIR: Here we sit, five months into your campaign and there are some eye-opening poll numbers out there, and I'm sure you're aware of them, when it comes to how Americans see you. Our ABC poll, Gallup, Quinnipiac showing your favorability numbers taking a sharp dive.

	In one poll, the lowest ever. And when voters were asked, "What is the first word that comes to mind when you think of Hillary Clinton?" Words like liar, dishonest, untrustworthy were at the top of the list. Does this tell you that your original explanation about the private server, that you did it to carry one phone out of convenience, that this didn't sit well with the American people?

	HILLARY CLINTON: Well, David, obviously, I don't like hearing that. I am confident by the end of this campaign people will know they can trust me. And that I will be on their side and will fight for them and their families. But I do think I could have and should have done a better job answering questions earlier.

	I really didn't perhaps appreciate the need to do that. What I had done was allowed, it was above board. 


no it wasn't


	That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that. I take responsibility. And I'm trying to be as transparent as I possibly can to not only release 55,000 pages of my emails, turn over my server.


but she had two servers


http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/hillary-clinton-email-timeline/index.html
	August 11, 2015 -- Clinton agrees to turn over her private email server and a thumb-drive backup to authorities.

	August 12, 2015 -- One of Clinton's lawyers confirms that the private server used to contain Clinton's emails from 2009-13 was turned over to the Justice Department. The server was previously wiped of data, but FBI officials are confident that the data from it will be able to be recovered. Law enforcement officials suspect that the examination will take months.

	Rep. Jordan: In March, you also said this: your server was physically located on your property, which is protected by the Secret Service. I’m having a hard time figuring this out, because this story’s been all over the place.  But — there was one server on your property in New York, and a second server hosted by a Colorado company in — housed in New Jersey. Is that right? There were two servers?

	Mrs. Clinton:   No.

	Rep. Jordan:    OK.

	Mrs. Clinton:   There was a — there was a server…

	Rep. Jordan:    Just one?

	Mrs. Clinton: . . . that was already being used by my husband’s team. An existing system in our home that I used, and then later, again, my husband’s office decided that they wanted to change their arrangements, and that’s when they contracted with the company in Colorado.

	Rep. Jordan:    And so there’s only one server? Is that what you’re telling me? And it’s the one server that the FBI has?

	Mrs. Clinton: The FBI has the server that was used during the tenure of my State Department service.

And that's why I believed and I think it's been proven to be accurate, that the vast majority of everything that I was emailing would be captured on the State Department system.

	DAVID MUIR: But North Korea's nuclear program? Wouldn't that be classified?

	HILLARY CLINTON: There's a lot of public information about their nuclear program. I don't know the specifics about the one that they are claiming is classified. I can only repeat what happens to be the case-- that I did not send nor receive information that was marked classified at the time that it was sent or received. 

dodges question that she sent or recieved classified info, changes story

first was "I never sent or recieved classified"

then dodge, "I never sent anything marked classified"

also false


	 DAVID MUIR: Let's go bigger picture here for a moment, because many who quite frankly wanted to support you have now learned of this F.B.I. investigation, have learned of the I.T. guy who helped set up the server planning to plead the Fifth.

	And many who have said to themselves, you know, "Hillary Clinton of all people who's been in the public eye for so long that she should have known." And perhaps the more important question they're asking is, "Can Hillary Clinton survive this?" Can you?

	HILLARY CLINTON: Yes, of course I can. I, as you might guess, have been around a while and there've been lots of, you know, attacks and counter-attacks and questions raised. And I can survive it because I think I'm running to be president to do what the country needs done.

	And I believe the American people will respond to that. You know, with respect to the two points that you made, this is a security investigation. And that's why I turned over my server. It's not, as has been confirmed, a criminal investigation. Again, that needs to be explained to people because they may not understand the difference. 


but she was just told that Pagliano was pleading the fifth, from which anybody can infer it is a criminal investigation

so she is clearly lying

she is a lawyer, has been for years. Surely she can't be unsophisticated in that?

	 DAVID MUIR: So you do wake-up--

	HILLARY CLINTON: --it's absolutely worth it.

	DAVID MUIR: --you wake-up like the rest of us every once in a while and think--

	HILLARY CLINTON: Yeah, it's hard.

	DAVID MUIR: --"Am I really doing this again?"

Muir sounds like he knows something


why actually was she running?

just really wanted to be first woman president?

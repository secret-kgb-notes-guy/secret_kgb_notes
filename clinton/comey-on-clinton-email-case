	MALONEY: Thank you.

	The speaker of the House Paul Ryan was even more critical. He accused you of not applying the law equally. He said your recommendation shows, and I quote, “the Clintons are living above the law; they’ve being held to a different set of standards; that is clearly what this looks like,” end quote.

	How do you respond to his accusations that you held the Clintons to a different set of standards than anyone else? Did you hold them to a different standard or the same standard?

	COMEY: It’s just not — it’s just not accurate. We try very hard to apply the same standard whether you’re rich or poor, white or black, old or young, famous or not known at all. I just hope folks will take the time to understand the other cases, because there’s a lot of confusion out there about what the facts were of the other cases that I understand good people, reasonable people to have questions.

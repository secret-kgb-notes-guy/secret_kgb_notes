Russia is attacking us in a way we've never seen before. They have taken over large parts of our government: http://pastebin.com/ckEaZwWH This situation is NOT under control. Please tell everybody you can. The government and media are only talking about a small part of all this, and I don't know how else to get this message out there.

And please be careful blaming this all on Republicans. Russia is trying to essentially brainwash both sides so we don't know how to work together to stop this attack. Don't let their divide and conquer strategy work. Republicans are Americans. If we fight for our country, we fight for them too.

And please be careful with blaming the other party for this, which I see some people doing. Russia is trying to essentially brainwash members of both our political parties so we don't know how to work together to stop this attack. Don't let their divide and conquer strategy work. Republicans and Democrats are Americans. If we fight for our country, we fight for them.

	After a flurry of GOP statements Tuesday night criticizing Trump for axing Comey so suddenly, there were no new Republican calls on Wednesday for a special prosecutor or select committee to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) on Wednesday forcefully rejected calls for an independent prosecutor or commission.

	Days Before Firing, Comey Asked for More Resources for Russia Inquiry

	Mr. Comey made his appeal to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who also wrote the Justice Department’s memo that was used to justify the firing of Mr. Comey this week, the officials said.


http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-comey-critics-idUKKBN1861HS
	Responding to media reports that Comey had asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week for a significant boost in resources for the agency's probe, Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said in an email: "Totally false."


DOJ lying?


	Trump said he had "a very, very good meeting" with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and they discussed Syria's civil war. Their meeting was the highest-level public contact between Trump and Putin's government since Trump took office.

	During an earlier appearance at the State Department, Lavrov responded in a sarcastic tone when answering a question about Comey's dismissal, saying: "Was he fired? You're kidding. You're kidding."

	BAIER: Why is that not a good idea?

	RYAN: Yes. I don't think that's a good idea. I think we can -- first of all, we have three investigations going on right now. We have a House investigation by our Intelligence Committee, which is the appropriate committee to do that, I believe.

	And we have the Senate Intelligence Committee -- you just played Richard Burr -- doing an investigation. And you have the FBI investigating all things Russia. 

	...So I really do believe that these three investigations are the way to go.


https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/constitution-check-does-the-fbi-have-power-to-decide-who-gets-prosecuted
	But the public may not always understand that the FBI does not have the job of deciding who should, or should not, be prosecuted for crime.  It was created to do investigations – period.  When it finishes one of its probes, it can and usually does make recommendations, but someone else has the job of deciding what to do with the results of those investigations – an actual prosecutor.


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/trump-russia-cia-john-brennan.html
	WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that Russia was working to help elect Donald J. Trump president, a finding that did not emerge publicly until after Mr. Trump’s victory months later, former government officials say.

	...administration officials proposed that the eight senior lawmakers write a letter to state election officials warning them of the possible threat posed by Russian hacking, officials said.

	But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, resisted, questioning the underpinnings of the intelligence, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. McConnell ultimately agreed to a softer version of the letter, which did not mention the Russians but warned of unnamed “malefactors” who might seek to disrupt the elections through online intrusion.


Looks like they've picked their side.

	This version of events is not beyond the realm of imagination, since it repeats in structural form what happened last week with the firing of FBI Director Jim Comey: the president does something that surprises, even shocks; the White House puts out a convenient explanation that is hard to believe but, if true, undermines the critique of the president; and then the president undermines his own defense effort by delivering a totally different account that seems to confirm the worst interpretations of the original action.

seriously

	McMaster further pre-butted another likely follow-up question: If it was not sensitive, why did the White House argue so strenuously with the Post not to publish their original story? McMaster’s answer: because in developing the story, the Post had done additional reporting that generated new details that were not shared with the Russians but, if made public, would in fact result in a dangerous release of classified material.

http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/grassley-feinstein-hint-trump-not-target-fbi-probe
	(CNSNews.com) - Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), have backed up President Trump's contention that he is not a target of the FBI's Russia probe:

	Reading from a prepared statement last Thursday, Grassley said he and Feinstein know who the targets of the FBI investiation are; they will not say who they are; but they've heard nothing from the FBI to contradict Trump, who says he was informed three times by former FBI Director James Comey that he is not a target of the ongoing FBI investigation.

Why would they know? isn't that a bad thing...

http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/17/justice-dept-to-appoint-special-counsel-to-take-over-russia-probe.html

Rosenstein appointed Mueller

Don't trust either

	According to a Congressional Research Service report, the attorney general — or in this case, Rosenstein, since Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself — must be notified of any specific actions the special counsel intends to take, and has the ability to countermand those proposed actions.

	Modern special counsels have less independence than the special prosecutors employed during the Watergate investigations of the 1970s, who were appointed under a law that has now expired.

that's a problem...

	“There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” McCarthy (R-Calif.) said, according to a recording of the June 15, 2016, exchange, which was listened to and verified by The Washington Post. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is a Californian Republican known in Congress as a fervent defender of Putin and Russia.

	House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) immediately interjected, stopping the conversation from further exploring McCarthy’s assertion, and swore the Republicans present to secrecy.

A coverup? no shit!

	Some of the lawmakers laughed at McCarthy’s comment. Then McCarthy quickly added: “Swear to God.”

	Ryan instructed his Republican lieutenants to keep the conversation private, saying: “No leaks. . . . This is how we know we’re a real family here.”

"a real family"

	Evan McMullin, who in his role as policy director to the House Republican Conference participated in the June 15 conversation, said: “It’s true that Majority Leader McCarthy said that he thought candidate Trump was on the Kremlin’s payroll. Speaker Ryan was concerned about that leaking.”

	“This was a failed attempt at humor,” Sparks said.


	In May 2016, McCarthy signed up to serve as a Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention, breaking ranks with Ryan, who said he still was not ready to endorse the candidate. McCarthy’s relationship with Trump became so close that the president would sometimes refer to him as “my Kevin.”


what

	Groysman, on an official visit to Washington, met separately with Ryan and McCarthy on June 15 at the Capitol.

	He told them how the Russians meddled in European politics and called for “unity” in addressing the threat, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Ryan issued a statement after the meeting saying, “the United States stands with Ukraine as it works to rebuild its economy and confront Russian aggression.”

But good luck fighting back against Putin without any weapons your on your own


	Ryan mentioned his meeting with Groysman, prompting Rodgers to ask: “How are things going in Ukraine?” according to the recording.

	The situation was difficult, Ryan said. Groysman, he said, had told him that Russian-backed forces were firing 30 to 40 artillery shells into Ukrainian territory every day. And the prime minister described Russian tactics that include “financing our populists, financing people in our governments to undo our governments.”

	Ryan said Russia’s goal was to “turn Ukraine against itself.” Groysman underlined Russia’s intentions, saying, “They’re just going to roll right through us and go to the Baltics and everyone else,” according to Ryan’s summary of the prime minister’s remarks in the recording.

	“Yes,” Rodgers said in agreement, noting that the Russians were funding nongovernmental organizations across Europe as part of a wider “propaganda war.”

	“Maniacal,” Ryan said. “And guess, guess who’s the only one taking a strong stand up against it? We are.”

...

	Rodgers disagreed. “We’re not . . . we’re not . . . but, we’re not,” she said.

	The Trump administration is exploring whether it can use an obscure ethics rule to undermine the special counsel investigation into ties between President Donald Trump's campaign team and Russia, two people familiar with White House thinking said on Friday.

	Trump has said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's hiring of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation "hurts our country terribly."

	Within hours of Mueller's appointment on Wednesday, the White House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations, which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm’s clients for one year after their hiring, the sources said. 

Or choose a different prosecutor...

	Moreover, the White House has not ruled out the possibility of using the rule to challenge Mueller’s findings in court, should the investigation lead to prosecution.

	FOCUS ON CASTING A CLOUD OVER MUELLER

	But the administration is now mainly focused on placing a cloud over his reputation for independence, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

	Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law, said the Justice Department can grant a waiver if concerns about bias are minimal. 


A way to convince the public Mueller's conflicts of interest aren't a big deal?

	I did not know this particular fact, but it doesn't surprise me at all. The principal source for the rest of this story is, well, me—specifically a long interview I gave to reporter Michael Schmidt on Friday about my conversations with FBI Director James Comey over the last few months, and particularly about one such conversation that took place on March 27 over lunch in Comey’s FBI office.

	...I called Schmidt Friday morning after reading his earlier story, which ran the previous evening, about Comey’s dinner with President Trump and the President’s demands at that dinner for a vow of loyalty. Schmidt had reported that Trump requested that Comey commit to personal loyalty to the President, and that Comey declined, telling the President that he would always have Comey’s “honesty.” When I read Schmidt’s account, I immediately understood certain things Comey had said to me over the previous few months in a different, and frankly more menacing, light. While I am not in the habit of discussing with reporters my confidential communications with friends, I decided that the things Comey had told me needed to be made public.

Wittes reinterpreting what Comey tells him, reporting to NYT?

	He told me that Trump sometimes talked to him a fashion designed to implicate him in Trump’s way of thinking. While I was not sure quite what this meant, it clearly disquieted Comey. He felt that these conversations were efforts to probe how resistant he would be to becoming a loyalist. In light of the dramatic dinner meeting and the Flynn request, it’s easy to see why they would be upsetting and feel like attempts at pressure.

"implicate him in Trump's way of thinking" huh?

	That said, his reservations were palpable. “Rod is a survivor,” he said. And you don’t get to survive that long across administrations without making compromises. “So I have concerns.”

Interesting, according to Wittes, Comey is concerned about Rosenstein

	Comey, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, said — under oath — that he's never been pressured to close an investigation for political purposes.

	"Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something like that — without an appropriate purpose."

	"I mean where oftentimes they give us opinions that 'We don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.' But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason."

	"That would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience," Comey told the senators.


I think NYT reported Comey memo says Trump asked Comey to "back off"?

	Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) first discussed removing James Comey as FBI director last winter, even before Sessions was confirmed as attorney general, Rosenstein told lawmakers Friday.

	Rosenstein made his comments while briefing all House members on his role in last week’s firing of Comey, a day after meeting with senators on the same topic.

	“In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI,” Rosenstein said in his prepared opening statement. “Among the concerns that I recall were to restore the credibility of the FBI, respect the established authority of the Department of Justice, limit public statements and eliminate leaks.”

	The discussion raises questions not just about President Donald Trump’s decision to oust Comey, but Sessions' public statements about Comey's performance.

	During the presidential campaign, Sessions criticized the then-FBI director — but for the opposite reasons cited by Rosenstein in a controversial three-page memo laying out the rationale for firing Comey. Sessions said Comey was going too easy on Hillary Clinton, whereas Rosenstein wrote last week that Comey had treated her unfairly in his handling of the FBI's investigation into her emails.

	In October, Sessions praised Comey's decision to alert Congress he was reopening the Clinton email investigation 11 days before the election. "He had an absolute duty, in my opinion, 11 days or not, to come forward with the new information that he has and let the American people know that, too," Sessions, who was a top Trump campaign surrogate, told Fox Business at the time.


Rosensetein and Sessions plotting to fire Comey early as last Winter, yet Sessions and Rosenstein's reasons disagree.



	Rosenstein told House members he learned on May 8 that Trump planned to fire Comey and “sought my advice and input.” He then wrote his memo, dated May 9, which he said was reviewed by several career attorneys at the Justice Department.

	As they left the briefing, frustrated House Democrats said Rosenstein left many of their questions unanswered. They also complained about the meeting being classified, saying no classified information was discussed.

	“This was a useless briefing and did not provide any more information to clarify the motivation of his memo-writing and only has, I think, caused more confusion and anger among members of Congress,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). “He refused to answer questions.”

	Added Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.): “It wasn't particularly helpful. It wasn't particularly classified.”

	Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said he believed the appointment of a special counsel should give Congress a chance to “reset.”

	"Essentially the people who wanted a special counsel got what they asked for, so now it's time to let him do his job,” Cornyn said. “I do think whatever committees have some jurisdictional hook on this will be conducting our oversight.

	“But I think it's time for maybe a reset in terms of the way we approach these because we're not the Department of Justice, we're not the special counsel,” Cornyn continued. “We don't have the authority to bring cases in court but we do have important responsibilities on oversight and that's where we should be focusing."

	In addition to the requests to Coats and Rogers, senior White House officials sounded out top intelligence officials about the possibility of intervening directly with Comey to encourage the FBI to drop its probe of Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, according to people familiar with the matter. The officials said the White House appeared uncertain about its power to influence the FBI. 

That would be obstruction of Justice, no?

	In December, Trump’s congressional allies falsely claimed that the FBI did not concur with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the White House. Comey and then-CIA Director John Brennan later said that the bureau and the agency were in full agreement on Moscow’s intentions.

	WASHINGTON — President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting.

	“I hope you can let this go,” the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo.


That would also be obstruction of Justice

	Any investigation would pay close attention to the timeline. In January, only days after the inauguration, then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates had informed Trump's White House counsel that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI as part of an active investigation. Yates was fired soon after because, the White House said, she refused to defend the president's travel ban in court.

	Flynn left his post in February after media reports that he misled the vice president about his contacts with Russia. The following day, The New York Times reported, Trump asked Vice President Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to leave a national security meeting so Trump could speak with Comey alone. That's when, Comey later wrote, the president had asked him to ease off Flynn.

	NPR asked a Comey associate this week why the FBI director felt the need to take "very detailed" notes memorializing the conversation. "He was concerned," said the associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Not long after Comey put that exchange with Trump in writing and after the FBI director told lawmakers the investigation of Russian interference and possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign was active, Comey was fired.

	We also told the White House Counsel that General Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI on February 24. Mr. McGahn asked me how he did and I declined to give him an answer to that. 


	...WHITEHOUSE: Was the interview of General Flynn accelerated once you became aware of this information and felt you needed to get his statement quickly?

	YATES: Well, we had wanted to tell the White House as quickly as possible and we're working with the FBI and in the course of the investigation but certainly, we did

	...FEINSTEIN: Well, did you discuss this with other DOJ career professionals?

	YATES: Certainly, leading up to our notification on the 26th. It was a topic of a whole lot of discussion, in DOJ and with other members of the intel community, and we discussed it at great length. But after the 30th, again, I wasn't at DOJ anymore, so I didn't have any further discussions after that point about what was being done with respect to that. FEINSTEIN: Did you consult with other career prosecutors?

	YATES: Absolutely. We had, really, the experts within the national security division. As we were navigating this situation, they were working with the FBI on the investigation, and we were trying to make a determination about how best to make this notification so that we could get the information to the White House that they needed to be able to act.


...YATES: And I can't reveal the internal FBI investigation, Senator, even though it's not -- even though part would not be technically classified, it's on ongoing investigation and I can't reveal that.

	BLUMENTHAL: Did you tell Donald McGahn that then-National Security Adviser Flynn told the truth to the FBI?

	YATES: No, he asked me how he had done in the interview, and I specifically declined to answer that.

	BLUMENTHAL: Because it was part of an investigation?

	YATES: That's right.

	BLUMENTHAL: Was that intended to indicate to him that Michael Flynn had a problem in that interview?

	YATES: No, I was intending to let him know that Michael Flynn had a problem on a lot of levels, but it wasn't necessarily with respect to how he performed in the interview. I was intentionally not letting him know how the interview had gone.


	...YATES: Sure. The first topic in the second meeting was essentially why does it matter to DOJ if one White House official lies to another. The second topic related to the applicability of criminal statutes and the likelihood that the Department of Justice would pursue a criminal case. The third topic was his concern that their taking action might interfere with an investigation of Mr. Flynn. And the fourth topic was his request to see the underlying evidence.

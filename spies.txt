	Summarized and paraphrased, Lenin’s plan stated: 

	First, we will take eastern Europe, then the masses of Asia, then we will encircle the United States which will be the last bastion of capitalism. We will not have to attack. It will fall like an overripe fruit into our hands.

	Anatoliy Mikhaylovich Golitsyn CBE (Russian: Анатолий Михайлович Голицын; born August 25, 1926) is a Soviet KGB defector ... He provided "a wide range of intelligence to the CIA on the operations of most of the 'Lines' (departments) at the Helsinki and other residencies, as well as KGB methods of recruiting and running agents." He is an Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and, as late as 1984, was an American citizen.

	...In 1984, Golitsyn published the book New Lies For Old, wherein he warned about a long-term deception strategy of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the United States.

	One chief aim was the infiltration, placement, and subversion of American political life at all levels of society. Earl Browder, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), served as an agent recruiter himself on behalf of Soviet intelligence.

	In the Watkins decision, later modified, the Court questioned the right of Congress to inquire into and publicize communism and subversion suggesting that this “involved a broad scale intrusion into the lives and affairs of private citizens.”

	...However, communist theory has played only a minor role in the growth of world communism. Communist tactics of infiltration, subversion, bribery, lies, bluff, brutality, treason, and murder are played down or ignored as the force which has spread communism around the world.

	The driving force of this war has very little to do with natural aspirations of people for better lives and greater freedoms. If at all, these aspirations are being used and taken advantage of by the manipulators and progenitors of the war. The real driving force of this war of aggression is IDEOLOGY-- something you cannot eat, wear or store for a "rainy day." An integral part of this war of ideology is IDEOLOGICAL SUBVERSION-- the process of changing the perception of reality in the minds of millions of peoples all over the world. The late comrade Andropov, the former head of the Soviet KGB, called this war of Communist aggression, "the final struggle for the MINDS and hearts of the people."

	The reason that I am so certain of the real goal of Communist aggression is that I was actually a part and an unwilling instrument of Soviet subversion tactics. Having been trained and used by the KGB for their global ideological subversion campaign, I have some first-hand knowledge about the people behind this war and the methods they use.

	...The art of duping the masses into doing things to their own disadvantage and making them believe it is "the will of people" is as ancient as mankind itself.
The essence of subversion is best expressed in the famous Marxist slogan, (if you substitute "proletarians" for a more appropriate word): "Useful idiots of the world UNITE!” To achieve the desired effect, the subverter must first make idiots out of normal people, and DIVIDE them, before turning the people into a homogenized mass of useful and united idiots. Tanks and missiles may or may not be needed at final stage. For the time being they are simply the means of terrorizing people into inaction and submission.

	The evidence of the extent to which Russia is engaging in psychological warfare against the West is now available in black and white. ZDF’s Frontal21 and DIE ZEIT gained access to more than 10,000 emails from the "Information Ministry" of the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

	...The strategists behind the "Internal Information Policy" devote special attention to the climate of opinion in social networks, and they note that changing moods on Facebook and its Russian counterpart VK, as well as on Twitter, should be carefully monitored. ...The large number of comments posted by members of this group is intended to create the impression among ordinary Internet users that "a majority thinks this way."

	...Some journalists find it exciting not to remain neutral in their reporting, but to become involved in psychological warfare instead, says Dmitri R., who worked as an independent journalist in eastern Ukraine and was supposed to become a propagandist. ...”I was always given the same answer: This is not the time for journalism. Journalism is something for peace. For the war, which is also an information war, we need information soldiers. We truly regarded ourselves as information soldiers."

	...In addition to being a former KGB agent, President Putin has also brought many of his former KGB colleagues into the presidential administration. The persistent characterization of the regime in Kiev as fascist; the aggressive accusation that third parties were to blame for shooting down the MH17 passenger jet over eastern Ukraine; the ongoing false claim that Lisa, an ethnic German girl from Russia, was raped by refugees, even when it had already been established that this was not true; the discrediting of critical journalists as US-controlled agents; and, finally, the dissemination of contradictory versions of the shelling of a United Nations aid convoy in Syria – all of these obfuscation attempts follow a pattern that goes back to the Soviet Union. The Donetsk leak now offers proof of how it is being used in eastern Ukraine.

	Outbreaks of fighting between pro-Russian rebels and the Ukrainian army frequently violate the truce and lives are still being lost, two years after the conflict broke out.

	..."Madness" is the one word Valentina uses to sum up the war.

	...On the rebel side, where people can only watch Russian TV, some semblance of normality can be found in pockets of the main city in rebel hands, Donetsk.

	...A stoical, cash-strapped woman of 62 blames Ukraine for the fighting and says her heart has "always been leaning towards Russia".

	But Yilena, 25, is visiting her family in Donetsk and is representative of a huge number of largely younger people who have left this territory.

	"There is no future here and no prospects," she says.

	All warfare is based primarily on the deception of an enemy. Fighting on a battlefield is the most primitive way of making war. There is no art higher than to destroy your enemy without a fight—by SUBVERTING anything of value in the enemy’s country.

	  Sun Tzu
	  Chinese philosopher
	  500 B.C.

	...500 years before Christ, the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu formulated the principle of subversion this way:

		1. Cover with ridicule all of the valid traditions in your opponent's country.
		2. Implicate their leaders in criminal affairs and turn them over to the scorn of their populace at the right time;
		3. Disrupt the work of their government by every means;
		4. Do not shun the aid of the lowest and most despicable individuals of your enemy's country.
		5. Spread disunity and dispute among the citizens.
		6. Turn the young against the old.
		7. Be generous with promises and rewards to collaborators and accomplices.

	Sound familiar? About 2500 years later we can read this very same instruction in a secret document, allegedly authored by the Communist International for their "young revolutionaries". The document is titled "Rules of Revolution": 

		1. Corrupt the young, get them interested in sex, take them away from religion. Make them superficial and enfeebled. 
		2. Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial issues of no importance. 
		3. Destroy people's faith in their national leaders by holding the latter up for contempt, ridicule and disgrace. 
		4. Always preach democracy, but seize power as fast and as ruthlessly as possible.  
		5. By encouraging government extravagances, destroy its credit, produce years of inflation with rising prices and general discontent. 
		6. Incite unnecessary strikes in vital industries, encourage civil disorders and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of the government towards such disorders. 
		7. Cause breakdown of the old moral virtues: honesty, sobriety, self-restraint, faith in the pledged word. 

	I can not vouch for authenticity of this document, which, according to American conservative media was captured by the Allied forces after WW II in defeated Germany, in Dusseldorf. But I can assure you, that these "rules" are almost a literal interpretation of those "theories and practices" which I learned from my KGB superiors and colleagues within the 'Novosti' Press Agency.

https://warontherocks.com/2016/11/trolling-for-trump-how-russia-is-trying-to-destroy-our-democracy/
	Until recently, Western governments focused on state-to-state negotiations with Putin’s regime largely missed Russian state-to-people social media approaches. Russia’s social media campaigns seek five complementary objectives to strengthen Russia’s position over Western democracies:

	  - Undermine citizen confidence in democratic governance;
	  - Foment and exacerbate divisive political fractures;
	  - Erode trust between citizens and elected officials and democratic institutions;
	  - Popularize Russian policy agendas within foreign populations;
	  - Create general distrust or confusion over information sources by blurring the lines between fact and fiction

	In sum, these influence efforts weaken Russia’s enemies without the use of force. Russian social media propaganda pushes four general themes to advance Moscow’s influence objectives and connect with foreign populations they target.

http://www.interpretermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/The_Menace_of_Unreality_Final.pdf
	- The Kremlin exploits the idea of freedom of information to inject disinformation into society. The effect is not to persuade (as in classic public diplomacy) or earn credibility but to sow confusion via conspiracy theories and proliferate falsehoods.

	- The Kremlin is increasing its “information war” budget. RT, which includes multilingual rolling news, a wire service and radio channels, has an estimated budget of over $300 million, set to increase by 41% to include German- and French- language channels. There is increasing use of social media to spread disinformation and trolls to attack publications and personalities. 

	- Unlike in the Cold War, when Soviets largely supported leftist groups, a fluid approach to ideology now allows the Kremlin to simultaneously back far-left and far-right movements, greens, anti-globalists and financial elites. The aim is to exacerbate divides and create an echo chamber of Kremlin support.

	- There is an attempt to co-opt parts of the expert community in the West via such bodies as the Valdai Forum, which critics accuse of swapping access for acquiescence. Other senior Western experts are given positions in Russian companies and become de facto communications representatives of the Kremlin.

	- Financial PR firms and hired influencers help the Kremlin’s cause by arguing that “finance and politics should be kept separate.” But whereas the liberal idea of globalization sees money as politically neutral, with global commerce leading to peace and interdependence, the Kremlin uses the openness of global markets as an opportunity to employ money, commerce and energy as foreign policy weapons. 

	...The weaponization of information, culture and money is a vital part of the Kremlin’s hybrid, or non-linear, war, which combines the above elements with covert and small-scale military operations. The conflict in Ukraine saw non-linear war in action. Other rising authoritarian states will look to copy Moscow’s model of hybrid war—and the West has no institutional or analytical tools to deal with it.

	Kremlin Values: Putin’s Strategic Conservatism

	Putin is onto something big....He has discovered a significant weapon with which to beat the West and divide its potential allies around the world. It’s a weapon we have given him gratis.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoliy_Golitsyn
	In 1984, Golitsyn published the book New Lies For Old, wherein he warned about a long-term deception strategy of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into a false sense of security

	...In 1995 Anatoliy Golitsyn and Christopher Story published a book entitled The Perestroika Deception containing purported memoranda attributed to Golitsyn claiming:

	  - The power of the KGB remains as great as ever ... Talk of cosmetic changes in the KGB and its supervision is deliberately publicized to support the myth of 'democratization' of the Soviet political system."

	  - “Scratch these new, instant Soviet 'democrats,' 'anti-Communists,' and 'nationalists' who have sprouted out of nowhere, and underneath will be found secret Party members or KGB agents."

	...In his book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA (Knopf, 1994), Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in New Lies For Old, 139 had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were 'not soon falsifiable'.

	According to Russian political scientist Yevgenia Albats, Golitsyn's book New Lies for Old claimed that "as early as 1959, the KGB was working up a perestroika-type plot to manipulate foreign public opinion on a global scale. The plan was in a way inspired by the teachings of the 6th-century BC. Chinese theoretician and military commander Sun Tsu, who said, "I will force the enemy to take our strength for weakness, and our weakness for strength, and thus will turn his strength into weakness." Albats argued that the KGB was the major beneficiary of political changes in Russia, and perhaps indeed directed Gorbachev. According to her, "one thing is certain: perestroika opened the way for the KGB to advance toward the very heart of power" in Russia. It has been said that Mikhail Gorbachev justified his new policies as a necessary step to "hug Europe to death", and to "evict the United States from Europe".

	In the course of these three years ... Gordievsky noted over forty subjects on which the London Residency was asked to promote active measures. Some were long-term operations such as that to discredit President Reagan. Other operations were short-term and tactical; in November 1982, for example, the Residency was ordered to try to depress western grain prices by spreading rumors, especially to the International Wheat Council, that Soviet grain purchases were to be only 35 million tons instead of the anticipated 44 million tons.

	Gordievsky: Russia has as many spies in Britain now as the USSR ever did

	KGB's former spy chief in Britain says he has no regrets about betraying the Soviet Union as he likens Putin to Mussolini

	...He began his espionage career in the KGB's second directorate, which was responsible for running "illegals" – agents with false biographies planted abroad. Many felt Russia's blundering espionage ring was more of a joke than a threat to US security.

	Gordievsky, however, said it would be unwise to be complacent about Moscow's intelligence activities. He mentions George Blake – a British spy who was a double agent for Moscow. ... Gordievsky described the treacherous Blake as "effective". He added: "You only need one spy to be effective."

http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/andrew-sword.html
	The KGB defector had brought with him to Britain details not of a few hundred but of thousands of Soviet agents and intelligence officers in all parts of the globe, some of them "illegals" living under deep cover abroad, disguised as foreign citizens. No one who spied for the Soviet Union at any period between the October Revolution and the eve of the Gorbachev era can now be confident that his or her secrets are still secure. When the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) exfiltrated the defector and his family from Russia in 1992, it also brought out six cases containing the copious notes he had taken almost daily for twelve years, before his retirement in 1984, on top secret KGB files going as far back as 1918. The contents of the cases have since been described by the American FBI as "the most complete and extensive intelligence ever received from any source."

	...In a top secret "Chairman's Order" of September 1990 emphasizing the importance of influence operations and other active measures ("one of the most important functions of the KGB's foreign intelligence service"), Kryuchkov instructed that "wider use should be made of archive material" to publicize a "positive" image of the KGB and "its more celebrated cases."

	The first approach to a Western writer offering material from KGB archives intended to create this "positive" image was to the mercurial John Costello, a freelance British historian who combined flair for research with a penchant for conspiracy theory.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegals_Program
	The Illegals Program, as it was called by the United States Department of Justice, was a network of Russian sleeper agents under non-official cover whose investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) culminated in the arrest of ten agents and a prisoner swap between Russia and the United States on July 9, 2010.

	...In July 2012, new details about the agents' activities were revealed that suggested that some of them planned to recruit their children to become agents.

	SPIEGEL ONLINE: Do you have evidence that other troll houses exist?

http://uselessdissident.blogspot.com/2008/11/interview-with-yuri-bezmenov-part-three.html
	Most of the activity of the department was to compile [a] huge amount volume of information on individuals who were instrumental in creating public opinion: publishers, editors, journalists, actors, educationalists, professors of political science, members of parliament, [and] representatives of business circles. Most of these people were divided roughly [into] two groups. Those who would toe the Soviet foreign policy, they would be promoted to the positions of power through media and public opinion manipulation. Those who refused the Soviet influence in their own country would be character-assassinated or executed physically, con-revolution.

	...But in reality, the main emphasis of the KGB is not in the area of intelligence at all. According to my opinion and [the] opinion of many defectors of my caliber, only about 15% of time, money, and manpower [are] spent on espionage as such. The other 85% is a slow process, which we call either ‘ideological subversion,’ or ‘active measures’-in the language of the KGB—or ‘psychological warfare.’ What it basically means is, to change the perception of reality, of every American, to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community and their country.

	It’s a great brainwashing process, which goes very slow[ly] and is divided [into] four basic stages. The first one [is] demoralization; it takes from 15-20 years to demoralize a nation.

	...The demoralization process in [the] United States is basically completed already. For the last 25 years... actually, it's over-fulfilled because demoralization now reaches such areas where previously not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such a tremendous success. Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to [a] lack of moral standards.

	...The next stage is destabilization. This time [the] subverter does not care about your ideas and the patterns of your consumption; whether you eat junk food and get fat and flabby doesn’t matter any more. This time—and it takes only from two to five years to destabilize a nation—what matters [are] essentials: economy, foreign relations, [and] defense systems.

	...The next stage, of course, is crisis. It may take only up to six weeks to bring a country to the verge of crisis. You can see it in Central America now.

	And, after crisis, with a violent change of power, structure, and economy, you have [the so-called] period of normalization. It may last indefinitely. Normalization is a cynical expression borrowed from Soviet propaganda. When the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in ‘68, Comrade Brezhnev said, ‘Now the situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized.’

	This is what will happen in [the] United States if you allow all these schmucks to bring the country to crisis, to promise people all kind[s] of goodies and the paradise on earth, to destabilize your economy, to eliminate the principle of free market competition, and to put [a] Big Brother government in Washington, D.C. with benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale, who will promise lots of thing[s], never mind whether the promises are fulfillable or not. He will go to Moscow to kiss the bottoms of [a] new generation of Soviet assassins, never mind... he will create false illusions that the situation is under control. [The] situation is not under control. [The] situation is disgustingly out of control.

	On these and many other operations, Mitrokhin's archive contains much material from KGB files which the SVR is still anxious to keep from public view. Unlike the documents selected for declassification by the SVR, none of which are more recent than the early 1960s, his archive covers almost the whole of the Cold War. Most of it is still highly classified in Moscow. The originals of some of the most important documents noted or transcribed by Mitrokhin may no longer exist. In 1989 most of the huge multi-volume file on the dissident Andrei Sakharov, earlier branded "Public Enemy Number One" by Andropov, was destroyed. Soon afterwards, Kryuchkov announced that all files on other dissidents charged under the infamous Article 70 of the criminal code (anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda) were being shredded. In a number of cases, Mitrokhin's notes on them may now be all that survives.

Nosenko made two extremely controversial claims: that Golitsyn was not a double agent but a KGB plant ...Regarding the first claim, Golitsyn had said from the beginning that the KGB would try to plant defectors in an effort to discredit him.

	Americans Claim Role in Yeltsin Win

	WASHINGTON — A team of American political strategists who helped Gov. Pete Wilson with his abortive presidential bid earlier this year said this week that they served as Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's secret campaign weapon in his comeback win over a Communist challenger.

	And while some Muscovites are debating whether the Americans saved Yeltsin's job or merely provided one voice among many working to revive the Russian president's political chances, the consultants have now emerged to give interviews about how they quietly peddled advice to Yeltsin's 36-year-old daughter and key advisor, Tatyana Dyachenko.

	...The team is still secretive about some of its Russian business. Dresner prefers to stay mum about whether he was in touch with his old colleague Dick Morris, now Clinton's chief campaign advisor. Citing certain "agreements" that they refuse to explain, Dresner and Gorton acknowledge only that information about their work was made available to the Clinton White House.

	...Perhaps the most troubling moment in their adventure came when it appeared some of Yeltsin's advisors in the Kremlin were trying to convince him to cancel the election.

	Russia: Many insiders say the amateur advisor is running the country while padding 'The Family' nest egg.

	...Today, former Kremlin aides paint a grim picture of an isolated, detached president who devotes only a few minutes a day to government affairs. The pro-democracy advocates of his early presidency are long gone, and he seldom meets with outsiders. His tiny circle of advisors, these former aides say, is more concerned with personal business interests than with matters of public policy.

	...Dyachenko is the central figure in "The Family," the small circle of presidential advisors who are said to exercise inordinate influence over Yeltsin, 68.

	...Under The Family's guidance, the country has seemed to lurch from crisis to crisis, with no apparent long-term plan for solving its vast economic and social problems. Over the last 20 months, the country has had five prime ministers, a disastrous financial meltdown and frequent political scandals. The government has started a new war in the separatist republic of Chechnya that is likely to end in disaster--like the last one. Despite Dyachenko's image-making efforts, public trust in Yeltsin hovers at 2% in opinion polls.

	"Several years ago, you couldn't imagine in a bad dream that a simple girl from a provincial town would be running state affairs, making important decisions and sacking prime ministers one after another," said Pavel I. Voshchanov, a former Yeltsin press secretary. "Our legislators don't do anything about it--not that they can or want to. All this creates a strong sense of doom, a feeling that our democracy died before actually being born."

	Until he was handpicked in August by then-President Boris Yeltsin to become prime minister, Putin had never been a public figure. He spent 17 years as a mid-level agent in the Soviet KGB's foreign intelligence wing, rising only to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Later, as an aide to a prickly, controversial mayor of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and Putin's home town, he made a point of staying in the background.

	Boris N. Yeltsin shocked his nation and the world today, announcing his resignation as president six months before the end of his term and handing over power to his favored successor, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.

http://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-resurrects-the-kgb-moscow-security/
	Soon after he was first appointed prime minister back in 1999, Vladimir Putin joked to an audience of top intelligence officers that a group of undercover spies, dispatched to infiltrate the government, was “successfully fulfilling its task.”

	It turns out Putin doesn’t do jokes. Over Putin’s years in power, not just the Kremlin but almost every branch of the Russian state has been taken over by old KGB men like himself.

	Last week news broke that their resurgence is soon to be topped off with a final triumph — the resurrection of the old KGB itself.

	Putin was always a celebrity, and a source of support, for Europe’s far-right parties, which are themselves on a roll. And now unabashed fans of his in conventional political parties are taking office or rising in the polls.

	Soon enough, the West may have its own Putin caucus. Here’s how it’s taking shape:

	...France ... Estonia ... Bulgaria ... Moldova ... United States ... The Netherlands ... Greece ... Hungary...

	Russian intelligence hackers, masquerading as third parties, have conducted attacks abroad that targeted critical infrastructure networks. “Russia also has used cyber tactics and techniques to seek to influence public opinion across Europe and Eurasia,” Clapper said.
 
	A declassified intelligence report on the Russian hacking released Friday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering the effort to help elect Trump. It warned that Russia would use lessons learned from the effort to disrupt elections of U.S. allies.

	Norway’s security service says nine email accounts — including those belonging to the Labour party, the foreign ministry and defense ministry — have been targeted by hackers believed to be the same Russia-linked group blamed for breaking into Democratic National Committee computers.
 
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/31/czech-cyber-attack-russia-suspected-of-hacking-diplomats-emails
	The Czech Republic has suffered a damaging security breach after hackers infiltrated the emails of dozens of its most senior diplomats in a massive cyber-attack thought to have been carried out by Russia.
 
	Lubomír Zaorálek, the country’s foreign minister, admitted that his own email account had been breached in a “sophisticated” operation he compared to the onslaught against the Democratic party in the recent US presidential election.
 
https://www.cyberscoop.com/hackers-break-polish-banks-government-regulator-charged-bank-security-standards/
	The identity of the attackers is unknown. The hack is being called the most serious attack in Polish history, a sophisticated operation requiring a well-resourced group to design and deploy new malware that hit servers and employees, according to analysis from Bad Cyber.
 
	Due to the fact that no money was stolen, Polish media is reporting that Polish officials suspect the attack was a foreign intelligence operation.
 
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/11/russia-waging-information-war-in-sweden-study-finds
	Sweden’s most authoritative foreign policy institute has accused Russia of using fake news, false documents and disinformation as part of a coordinated campaign to influence public opinion and decision-making in the Scandinavian country.
 
	The Swedish Institute of International Affairs said in a comprehensive study that Sweden had been the target of “a wide array of active measures” aimed at “hampering its ability to generate public support in pursuing its policies”
 
http://www.smh.com.au/world/germany-probes-russian-fake-news-campaigns-in-leadup-to-elections-20170109-gtolqr.html
	German government officials said they were carefully examining an unprecedented proliferation of fake news items amid intelligence agency reports of Russian efforts to influence the country's parliamentary election in September.
 
	The BfV domestic intelligence agency also confirmed on Monday that a December cyber attack against the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) used the same tools seen in a 2015 hack of the German parliament that was attributed to the APT28 Russian hacking group.
 
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/europe/netherlands-hacking-concerns-hand-count-ballots.html
	Concerned about the role hackers and false news might have played in the United States election, the Dutch government announced on Wednesday that all ballots in next month’s elections would be counted by hand.
 
	The decision to forgo electronic counting is a stark response to warnings that outside actors, including Russia, might try to tamper with pivotal elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany — three major democracies in which establishment parties are facing pressure from right-wing populism of the kind that fueled Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump’s triumph in the United States election.
 
http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/01/wikileaks-turns-its-attention-to-the-french-elections/
	WikiLeaks has served notice that it will enter the fray of the French presidential election.
 
	On Tuesday, its Twitter account promoted 3,630 documents from its archives on center-right presidential candidate François Fillon.
 
	None were of the salacious variety, yet the move has stoked fears among European security officials that WikiLeaks will repeat its U.S. electoral influence performance in France — and perhaps elsewhere in Europe. Some even worry that the propaganda apparatus will partner again with Russian operatives with the aim of tilting the outcome of elections in favor of Kremlin-friendly candidates.
 
http://www.politico.eu/article/cybersecurity-hackers-france-at-risk-of-being-next-election-hacking-victim/
	In addition, more than 1 million people in France still vote via electronic machines — which Pietrasanta said could also be vulnerable to hacking.
 
	“The question of cyberattacks is a real worry that is growing stronger at all levels [of government], both on the intensity of the threat and the sophistication of recent attacks,” said Pietrasanta. “The state has deployed financial means, but there is still lots of concern given what happened in the United States with the hacking of the Democratic Party.”
 
http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/01/putins-dnc-hackers-actively-targeting-french-elections/134603/
	The same Putin-state backed actors that stole emails from the DNC and John Podesta are targeting campaigns in France in the run up to critical elections in that country. The spear phish campaigns are identical to the attacks that the “Fancy Bear” group launched against the DNC and John Podesta.
 
	As the American press, intelligence community and Donald Trump play out a sordid spy drama, Vladimir Putin’s kompromat campaign of attempted data theft and election meddling continues across Europe, according to a cybersecurity professional with direct knowledge of the ongoing attempts.
 
	France’s Minister of Defense Jean-Yves Le Drian told French newspapers on Jan. 8 that he expected Russian actors to target France. “Of course, one cannot be naive,” he said.
 
	The objective in France is to advance Marine Le Pen’s National Front Party. Le Pen has advocated a weakening the EU and has supported Vladimir Putin on the issue of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
 
	France’s election will take place on April 23.
 
	The cybersecurity source declined to name specific parties that had been targeted, but the races themselves provide good indication of the Kremlin picks. The attack follows similar news from Germany. In December, Thomas Haldenwang, deputy president of the domestic security agency, or BfV, said Germany was also seeing increased spear phish attacks. Those attacks are also continuing, the source said.
 
	In Sweden, Major General Gunnar Karlson, the head of the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service, has also described increased an ongoing Russian spear phish campaigns against political targets in that country.
 
	Putin’s primary target in Germany is widely understood to be Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. Germany’s will take place in September.

	He said that if mainstream EU parties regained the trust of voters then Russia’s actions would be less effective.
 
	“The reason they have any real impact at all is the legitimacy deficit felt in the West. Address that, and there is little Moscow can do,” he said.

	Donald Trump's ties to Russia go back 30 years

	President Trump’s decades-long ties to Russia are back in the spotlight after his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign this week over his failure to disclose phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow.

	Trump’s long-standing ties to Russia might explain why his policy is “noticeably weaker on Russia than on anything else,” said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and Uzbekistan under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_spectator/2016/03/trump_s_nuclear_experience_advice_for_reagan_in_1987.html
	Trump’s Nuclear Experience
 
	In 1987, he set out to solve the world’s biggest problem.

	...So what is the deal Trump thinks can be done? What is the Trump Plan?
 
	It’s a deal with the Soviets. We approach them on this basis: We both recognize the nonproliferation treaty’s not working, that half a dozen countries are on the brink of getting a bomb. Which can only cause trouble for the two of us. The deterrence of mutual assured destruction that prevents the United States and the USSR from nuking each other won’t work on the level of an India-Pakistan nuclear exchange. Or a madman dictator with a briefcase-bomb team. The only answer is for the Big Two to make a deal now to step in and prevent the next generation of nations about to go nuclear from doing so. By whatever means necessary.

http://www.politico.eu/article/czech-stasi-spied-on-donald-and-ivana-trump-report/
	The Czech secret service spied on President-elect Donald Trump and his Czech first wife Ivana in the 1970s and 80s when the country was under Communist rule, German publication Bild reported Wednesday.

	A report compiled by the spy agency and obtained by Bild contain details of the couple’s marriage contract, including the fact that Trump wanted Ivana to bear three children and she would receive $1 million as a settlement if they divorced.

	The intelligence service noted Trump benefited from “a personal relationship with American presidents” and that his company was “free of taxes for 30 years.” The New York Times reported that huge financial losses in 1995 created a tax deduction that could have allowed him to avoid paying taxes for 18 years.

	A report from 1988 stated Trump wanted to become presidential candidate in the 1996 election and had expressed confidence he would win.

	Donald Trump, the property tycoon who is considering entering the race to be president of the United States, has proposed new defenses against the threat of biological attack by terrorists.
 
 	He believes antibiotics should be stockpiled in big cities and sensors should be developed to give early warning of biological devices. He even floated the idea of a new lottery game to finance a counter-terrorism spy network"
 
	America should also stunt the growth of foreign terrorist groups by offering jobs to Russian biotechnicians, he suggested.
 
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-trump-political-conflict-zone/story?id=42263092
	There is ample evidence in Russian media from that period in the 2000s that brokers mounted a significant effort to attract buyers to Trump properties in Florida, Toronto and New York. And Trump and his children participated in those campaigns.
 
	During the marketing of the Trump SoHo project, in which Trump licensed his name to a group that included Russian investors, the Trump family met with a group of Russian journalists at their New York offices to help boost interest in the project, according to Russian media reports. During the meeting, Trump was quoted telling the gathering of Russian journalists: “I really like Vladimir Putin. I respect him. He does his work well. Much better than our Bush.”

	Executive Talk: Donald Trump Jr. bullish on Russia and few emerging markets
 
	...Given what I’ve seen in Russia’s real estate market as of late relative to some of the emerging markets, the country seems to have a lot more natural strength, especially in the high-end sector where people focus on price per square-meter

	“...In Russia, I really prefer Moscow over all cities in the world.”

	“...After spending half a dozen trips to Russia in the last 18 months, several buyers have been attracted to our projects there and everything associated therewith. But it is definitely not an issue of being able to find a deal – but an issue of ‘Will I ever see my money back out of that deal or can I actually trust the person I am doing the deal with?' As much as we want to take our business over there, Russia is just a different world. Though the legal structure is in place for what we have today, and even 99 percent is covered, that 1 percent not covered could be 100 percent covered over there because it is a question of who knows who, whose brother is paying off who, etc.”

	With lawsuits pending and shady partners, Trump’s business empire could not withstand the scrutiny of a presidential campaign, and even his kids might have been muddied.
 
	...Sater, the son of a reputed Russian mob boss, whose mini–storage locker contained two unlicensed pistols and a shotgun, actually worked out of a penthouse office in Trump’s new building at 40 Wall Street. Lauria, who pled guilty to a racketeering charge in the pump-and-dump case, later claimed in a memoir he published that he’d been on talking terms with Trump.
 
	“What kind of interaction did you have with Mr. Sater,” Trump was asked in the O’Brien deposition back in 2007.
 
	“Not that much,” he replied. “I dealt mostly with Tevfik.”
 
	Trump was referring to Tevfik Arif, the founder and chairman of Bayrock, who’d told the Real Estate News shortly before Trump’s deposition that Donald “has been very helpful to us from the beginning and he's been very helpful in opening some doors.” In his deposition, Trump praised Arif’s “international connections,” and detailed half a dozen “phenomenal” prospective tower deals with Arif, including ones in Moscow, Yalta, Warsaw, Istanbul, and Kiev. He boasted that Arif was prepared to give Trump a 20 to 25 percent interest in his overseas projects, plus management fees and a possible percentage of gross, without Trump investing a nickel—just for the use of his name.
 
	...Arif is such a fabulist, according to the Kriss complaint, that he even “pretends to be Turkish to avoid connection to his questionable past in Russia.”

	TRUMP: Probably not. But I do get tired of seeing the country --

	WINFREY: Why would you not?

I probably would not, but I do get tired of seeing what is happening with this country. And, if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what is happening with this country.

	Most of those [pre-nuclear] countries are in one form or another dominated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union,” Trump says. “Between those two nations you have the power to dominate any of those countries. So we should use our power of economic retaliation and they use their powers of retaliation and between the two of us we will prevent the problem from happening. It would have been better having done something five years ago,” he says. “But I believe even a country such as Pakistan would have to do something now. Five years from now they’ll laugh.”
 
	“You think Pakistan would just fold? We wouldn’t have to offer them anything in return?”
 
	“Maybe we should offer them something. I’m saying you start off as nicely as possible. You apply as much pressure as necessary until you achieve the goal. You start off telling them, ‘Let’s get rid of it.’ If that doesn’t work you then start cutting off aid. And more aid and then more. You do whatever is necessary so these people will have riots in the street, so they can’t get water. So they can’t get Band-Aids, so they can’t get food.

	But there are other crucial reasons why the idea of seizing Iraqi oil fields is delusional. Arab governments still remember European colonial efforts to seize the region's oil nearly a century ago. State-owned oil assets are the crown jewels in many Arab countries.

	For President Trump to raise the specter of colonialism, with America as the aggressor, will alienate our Arab allies in the fight against ISIS. To do so when U.S. troop are fighting alongside Iraqi soldiers in the battle for Mosul is irresponsible. It can inspire Iraqi violence against American soldiers.

	"If I were a U.S. field commander in Iraq I'd pull my troops back to barracks," Crocker said, clearly furious that the president would needlessly put U.S. soldiers' lives at risk. If such an attack occurs, he said, "Donald Trump will be to blame."

	“I think it’s never a good idea to show the least disapproval with respect to an ally,” said François Hollande, the French president, at the opening of an agriculture exposition in Paris. “I wouldn’t do that to an ally and I would ask that the American president not do that with regard to France.”

	“Trump understood something of fundamental importance: the Russian Federation needs be considered a full-fledged Western country,” said Berlusconi, echoing sentiments that Putin has voiced repeatedly. “We need Russia to face — together — the dramatic problems of the international arena: from Islamist extremism to the wave of migrants. Up until now President Putin has shown himself capable of facing the challenges of our time before and better than the other international leaders.”

https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/11/trump-election-foreign-policy/505934/
	Wright: I think there are a lot of areas in which Trump has no fixed view and in which he contradicts himself, but there [is] a core set of visceral beliefs that he’s had for many years and that he’s not deviated from. The first is that he is opposed to America’s alliance arrangements with other countries. The second is that he opposes free trade and favors a more mercantilist international economic system. And the third is that he has this fondness for authoritarianism, particularly in Russia. Those three things—there’s evidence for them going back to the mid-1980s, and he’s persisted with them at often high political cost.

	The question is whether or not he would moderate or abandon those views if elected. I have no way of knowing, but my view would be that at his age, at 70 years old, having held these beliefs for the better part of 30 years, that he’s unlikely at the moment of complete vindication in his own mind to change his policy when he hasn’t so far.

	...What I mean by it, and what is generally meant by it, is the system that was created in the late 1940s that includes the U.S. alliance system, forward military basing around the world, originally the open Western economy and now the open global economy, and a set of institutions and rules that are imperfect but generally govern state behavior. Collectively, that order operated in the West until 1991, and then went more global—not completely global—and really is the organizing principle for world politics today. And that order rests primarily on American power and American foreign policy, in that others want it and like it, but it’s hard to see it persisting if the U.S. decided to pull out of it. It’s unlikely that NATO would exist in anything like its current form without America.

	Trump would jeopardize that by liquidating some of the key aspects of that order. The security order in Europe and Asia would be transformed. The global economy would be transformed. Now if he totally reverses himself and appoints all sorts of mainstream Republican foreign-policy leaders to be in his cabinet, then maybe that doesn’t apply. But if one takes him at his word, then that could happen.

	That’s where we get into the analogies of the ’30s, because this order has existed since the late ’40s, and obviously the period between the ’30s and ’40s was one of great conflict. So the last time that an order really fell apart and was replaced by something else was in the ’30s—not counting the Eastern order, which fell apart in 1989/91. The last time that the Western world was fundamentally changed was [in the ’30s].

	Friedman: Do you think the president of the United States has the power to undo that order single-handedly? He still has to deal with a Congress filled with people who have adhered to the bipartisan consensus that you mentioned.

	Wright: I think the answer, unfortunately, is yes, for a couple of reasons. The first is that the checks and balances that are inherent in the presidency mainly apply to domestic policy. They don’t apply to foreign policy nearly as much. There are some, but even the ones that are formal, like the appropriations for war, have been eroding in recent decades. In general the president has much freer scope of action on foreign policy. [Trump] may become frustrated with domestic policy and may focus on foreign policy, because it’s something he actually does care about and also he has more freedom of maneuver.

	...But I would say over a 10-year period, what would probably happen is that the world would become much more dangerous in terms of other countries coming close to conflict with each other, and that there would be a lot of revisionism—countries testing borders and trying to protect their own interests unilaterally. There would be an increase in security competition, and that may very well drag the United States back in at a later stage. Even if the U.S. said it wanted nothing to do with Europe, nothing to do with Asia, the history from the early 20th century is that that ultimately can get out of control and can drag the United States in.

	I [also] think the global economy would take a huge dive. There would probably be a very severe recession because the U.S. would not be guaranteeing the openness of the global economy. Trump’s position basically is: For the U.S. economy to do well, other countries must do worse. But our experience over the last 70-odd years is the opposite. It’s that in order for the U.S. and any individual country to do well, the global economy has to do well.

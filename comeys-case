Trump: "Comey was not doing a good job"


well fuck that sounds right to me

	BURR: Director, when the president requested that you, and I quote "Let Flynn go," General Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians, which is an offense, and if press accounts are right, there might have been discrepancies between facts and his FBI testimony. In your estimation, was general Flynn at that time in serious legal jeopardy, and in addition to that, do you sense that the president was trying to obstruct justice or just seek for a way for Mike Flynn to save face, given that he had already been fired?

	COMEY: General Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy. There was an open FBI criminal investigation of his statements in connection with the Russian contacts, and the contacts themselves, and so that was my assessment at the time. I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct. I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that's a conclusion I'm sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there, and whether that's an offense. 


So Flynn in legal jeopardy, Trump at least should know, says "I hope you can let this go."

	What was your impression, and what did you mean by this notion of a patronage relationship?

	COMEY: Well, my impression, and again it's my impression, I could always be wrong but my common sense told me what was going on is, either he had concluded or someone had told him that you didn't, you've already asked Comey to stay, and you didn't get anything for it.


Comey had the "impression," "could always be wrong" that Trump wanted something in return for Comey staying on the job?


	And that the dinner was an effort to build a relationship, in fact, he asked specifically, of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay. As I said, what was odd about that is we'd already talked twice about it by that point and he said I very much hope you'll stay. In fact, I just remembered sitting a third, when you've seen the. IC tour of me walking across the blue room, and what the president whispered in my ear was "I really look forward to working with you." So after those encounters -- 


"asked specifically of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay." And Comey goes on to say Trump might have had the intent there to influence Comey, make his job tied to doing what "the boss wants."


Trump also "thinking about firing" Comey (in his own words) for a long time

problem is intent could easily be something else, maybey Trump thinks Comey is "loyal" to Clinton/the "deep state" and was thinking of firing him for that.



http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	Now, you told senator Warner that the president was looking to, quote, get something. Looking back, did that dinner suggest that your job might be contingent on how you handled the investigation?

	COMEY: I don't know that I'd go that far. I got the sense my job would be contingent upon how he felt I -- excuse me -- how he felt I conducted myself and whether I demonstrated loyalty. But I don't know whether I'd go so far as to connect it to the investigation. 


So Comey felt pressure, wouldn't connect to investigation


	WYDEN: He said the president was trying to create some sort of patronage. Behaving in a manner consistent with the wishes of the boss?

	COMEY: Yes. At least consider how what you're doing will affect the boss as a significant consideration. 




------

	WARNER: That was a few days before your firing.

	COMEY: On the Sunday after the inauguration. The next Friday I have dinner and the president begins by wanting to talk about my job and so I'm sitting there thinking wait a minute three times we've already, you've already asked me to stay or talked about me staying. My common sense, again I could be wrong but my common sense told me what's going on here is, he's looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job. 


Trump keeps asking Comey to stay, Comey sounds like he's way out there in speculating/assigning motive


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	COMEY: ...But then the explanations, the shifting explanations, confused me and increasingly concerned me. They confused me because the president and I had had multiple conversations about my job, both before and after he took office, and he had repeatedly told me I was doing a great job, and he hoped I would stay. And I had repeatedly assured him that I did intend to stay and serve out the years of my term. He told me repeatedly that he had talked to lots of people about me, including our current Attorney General, and had learned that I was doing a great job, and that I was extremely well-liked by the FBI workforce.


Comey makes it sound like Trump did want Comey to stay, or was afraid of him

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, I just want you to know that I have great respect for you. Senator Cornyn and I sit on the judiciary committee and we have the occasion to have you before us. You're a man of strength and I regret the situations we all find ourselves in. I just want to say that. Let me begin with one overarching question. Why do you believe you were fired?

	COMEY: I guess I don't know for sure. I believe — I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didn't know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe he's saying something that's not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 


Is that Comey's basis for thinking Trump fired him for the Russia investigation? he sounds unsure even about that


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: Do you believe the Russia investigation played a role?

	COMEY: In why I was fired?

	FEINSTEIN: Yes.

	COMEY: Yes. I've seen the president say so. 


says it multiple times, believes he was fired because of the Russia investigation because of what the President said



http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/trump-comey-russia-thing/index.html
	Trump: Regardless of this reccomendation, I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, you know this Rusher thing with Trump and Russia it's a made up story it's an excuse for the democrats for having lost an election


	...Were you angry at Comey because of the Russia investigation?

	Trump...No look, let me tell you, as far as I'm concerned, I absolutely want this thing to be done properly


Hard to use to show intent I think? don't they say false exculpatory statements are better?



http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/trump-comey-russia-thing/index.html
	COMEY: That's a question I can't answer. I think it is a reasonable question. If, as the president said, I was fired because of the Russia investigation, why was the attorney general involved in that chain? I don't know. So I don't have an answer for the question. 


Comey really doubles-down on "the president said I was fired because of the Russia investigation"



	REED: Now, the Russian investigation as you've pointed out and my colleagues is one of the most serious hostile acts against this country's history undermining our core of elections is not a discrete event. It will likely occur again and is likely being prepared for '18, '20 and beyond. And yet the president of the United States advised you because at your own — some relationship to the investigation. Then he shows up in the Oval Office with the Russian foreign minister first as classifying you as crazy and a real nutjob. He said “I faced great pressure because of Russia; that’s taken off.” Your conclusion would be that the president, I would think is downplaying the seriousness of this threat. In fact, took specific steps to stop a thorough investigation of the Russian influence, and also from what you've said or what was said this morning, doesn't seem particularly interested in these hostile threats by the Russians. Is that true?

	COMEY: I don't know that I can agree to that level of detail. There's no doubt it's a fair judgment. It's my judgment I was fired because of the Russia investigation. I was fired in some way to change — or the endeavor was to change the way the Russia investigation is being conducted. That is a very big deal. And not just because it involves me. The nature of the FBI and the nature of its work requires that it not be the subject of political consideration. And on top of that, you have the Russia investigation itself is vital, because of the threat. And I know I should have said this earlier, but it's obvious, if any Americans were part of helping the Russians do that to us, that is a very big deal. And I'm confident if that is the case, director Mueller will find that evidence. 


interesting--didn't Comey make explicit he thinks the "Flynn" and "Russia" investigations are separate things?


------


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: Let's go to the Flynn issue. The senator outlined, “I hope you could see your way to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” But you also said in your written remarks, and I quote, that you “had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December,”. Please go into that with more detail.

	COMEY: Well, the context and the president's word are what led me to that conclusion. As I said in my statement, I could be wrong, but Flynn had been forced to resign the day before. And the controversy around general Flynn at that point in time was centered on whether he lied to the vice president about his nature of conversations with the Russians, whether he had been candid with others in the course of that. So that happens on the day before. On the 1, the president makes reference to that. I understood what he wanted me to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynn's account of his conversations with the Russians. 


Comey still sounds unsure. The context he describes could also mean Trump wanted Comey to let the "Flynn lied to the vice President" thing go.


------


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: You describe two phone calls that you received from president trump. One on March 30th and one on April 11. He, quote, described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability, end quote, as president, and asked you, quote, to lift the cloud, end quote. How did you interpret that? What did you believe he wanted you to do?

	COMEY: I interpreted that as he was frustrated that the Russia investigation was taking up so much time and energy. I think he meant of the executive branch, but in the public square in general. It was making it difficult for him to focus on other priorities of his. But what he asked me was actually narrowing than that. I think what he meant by the cloud -- and, again, I could be wrong -- but the entire investigation is taking up oxygen and making it hard for me to focus on what I want to focus on. The ask was to get it out that I, the president, am not personally under investigation.


Comey still "interpreting" and unsure about what Trump meant by "the cloud"


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	RUBIO: On the cloud, we keep talking about this cloud, you perceive the cloud to be the Russian investigation in general?

	COMEY: Yes, sir. 


But Comey "percieves" it as the Russian investigation in general


------


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Director Comey, the meeting in the oval office where he made the request about Mike Flynn, was that only time he asked you to hopefully let it go?

	COMEY: Yes.

	RUBIO: And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia investigation, he was asking specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself?

	COMEY: That's how I understood it. Yes, sir.

	RUBIO: As you perceived it, while he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given the setting, the position and some of the circumstances?

	COMEY: Yes. 


Comey "understood it" and "perceived it" for "I hope you can let this go" as an order



------



http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	RUBIO: On March 30th during the phone call about general Flynn, you said he abruptly shifted and brought up something that you call, quote, unquote, the Mccabe thing. Specifically, the Mccabe thing as you understood it was that Mccabe's wife had received campaign money from what I assume means Terry McAuliffe?

	COMEY: Yes. 

	RUBIO: Close to the Clintons. Did he say, I don't like this guy because he got money from someone close to Clinton?

	COMEY: He asked me about McCabe and said, how is he going to be with me as president? I was rough on him on the campaign trail.

	RUBIO: Rough on Mccabe?

	COMEY: By his own account, he said he was rough on Mccabe and Mrs. Mccabe on the campaign trail. How is he going to be? I shared with the president, Andy is a pro. No issue at all. You have to know people of the FBI. They're not -- 


Comey adding to the case that Trump's intent based on fear of FBI?


http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/james-comey-memos-testimony/index.html
	The President went on to say that if there were some "satellite" associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn't done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren't investigating him.

	In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn't brought up "the McCabe thing" because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe's wife) campaign money. Although I didn't understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.


like "see I'm being nice to you"


Rubio brings up, did Trump except something in return?


Problem is it could be construed as Trump trying to "mend ties" after ragging on the FBI on the campaign trail

seems like a story that fits facts better?

A lot of "I hope you're not mad at me" kindof talk? "I hope you can let this go," "happy if you stay," "I was rough on McCabe"

Trump also hugging COmey (and COmey "disgusted" lol)


reportedly, Trump also suspected intelligence community of being out to get him


------


	COMEY: Yes, sir. He went farther than that. He said, and if some of my satellites did something wrong, it'd be good to find that out.

	RUBIO: That is the second part. The satellites, if one of my satellites, I imagine he meant some of the people surrounding his campaign, did something wrong, it'd be great to know that, as well.

	COMEY: Yes, sir. That's what he said.

	RUBIO: Are those the only two instances in which that back and forth happened, where the president was basically saying, and I'm paraphrasing here, it's okay. Do the Russia investigation. I hope it all comes out. I have nothing to do with anything Russia. It'd be great if it all came out, people around me were doing things that were wrong?

	COMEY: Yes. As I recorded it accurately there. That was the sentiment he was expressing. Yes, sir. 


Comey sounds more sure here, Trump saying "do the Russia investigation let it all come out" as if Trump is confident of his innocence


------


	RUBIO: What it comes down to is the president asked three things of you. Asked for your loyalty. You said you'd be loyally honest.

	COMEY: Honestly loyal.

	RUBIO: Honestly loyal. He asked you on one occasion to let the Mike Flynn thing go because he was a good guy. By the way, you're aware he said the same thing in the press the next day. He is a good guy, treated unfairly, etc. I imagine your FBI agents read that.

	COMEY: I'm sure they did.

	RUBIO: The president's wishes were known to them, certainly by the next day when he had a press conference with the prime minister. Going back, the three requests were, number one, be loyal. Number two, let the Mike Flynn thing go. He is a good guy, been treated unfairly. Number three, can you please tell the American people what these leaders in congress already know, which you already know and what you told me three times, that I'm not under personally under investigation.

	COMEY: That's right. 


Comey testifies Trump was making a "request" to let the Flynn thing go.


(Is "Flynn is a good guy" a false exculpatory statement?)


	WYDEN: Your testimony was that the president's request about Flynn could infect investigation. Had the president got what he wanted and what he asked of you, what would have been the effect on the investigation?

	COMEY: We would have closed any investigation of general Flynn in connection with his statements and encounters -- statements about encounters with Russians in the late part of December. We would have dropped an open criminal investigation. 


So Comey  testifies that Trump's intent was for Flynn investigation to be dropped


------

	KING: With regard to the -- several of these conversations, in his interview with Lester holt on NBC, the president said, I had dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. Is this an accurate statement?

	COMEY: No, sir. 

	...


	KING: Did you in any way initiate that dinner?

	COMEY: No. He called me at my desk at lunchtime and asked me, was I free for dinner that night. Called himself. Said, can you come over for dinner tonight? I said, yes, sir. He said, will 6:00 work? I think 6:00 first. Then he said, I was going to invite your whole family but we'll do it next time. Is that a good time? I said, sir, whatever works for you. He said, how about 6:30? I said, whatever works for you, sir. Then I hung up and had to call my wife and break a date with her. I was supposed to take her to dinner that night. 


establishing Trump as a liar? or, trying to?


https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html

	TRUMP: ...very early on. That dinner was arranged. I think he asked for the dinner.

	And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I'll, you know, consider. We'll see what happens.


yet still boils down to "he said, he said" (and Trump sounds unsure anyway)


------


So what is Comey's case?


The only thing he has it looks like is the Flynn investigation--"I hope you can let this go"


all of it relies on Trumps word vs. Comey


Comey say it as an "order," a "request," and if Trump "got what he wanted" Flynn investigation would be dropped


I love Comey's prepared statement. Still not sure it was written by him...


http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/james-comey-memos-testimony/index.html
	When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, "I want to talk about Mike Flynn." Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn't done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify.

So, Trump starts by saying he believes Flynn didn't do anything wrong with the Russians, but did do something wrong by lying to Pence.


	The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information -- a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed.

Priebus a witness?

	The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, "He is a good guy and has been through a lot." He repeated that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go." I replied only that "he is a good guy." (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would "let this go."


Trump repeats nothing wrong with Russians, but something wrong with VP.


	The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President.


Priebus and VP a witness?




https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/james-b-comey-lays-out-the-case-that-president-trump-obstructed-justice/2017/06/08/e7f49a42-4c4d-11e7-bc1b-fddbd8359dee_story.html?utm_term=.fe9d2cc597a6
	There was evidence of possible intent: when the president cleared the room so he could ask Comey — without the attorney general or his son-in-law present — about the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials after the 2016 election.

	There was the suggestion of quid pro quo: when Trump repeatedly raised the status of Comey’s job as he asked for loyalty.

	And there was the consequence: when Comey, having not steered investigators away from Flynn, was fired by Trump in May, long before the end of his 10-year term.


	...Of particular concern, Comey said, was that Trump asked other officials to leave him alone with his FBI director in the Oval Office before saying of Flynn: “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”

	“Why did he kick everybody out of the Oval Office?” Comey said. “That, to me as an investigator, is a very significant fact.”


zeroing in on this--kicking people out of the room shows intent to obstruct investigation?

	“I think any reasonable prosecutor would look at that and say it implies a consciousness of guilt,” Kramer said. “You know this is not something you’re supposed to be doing. You’re not even willing to do it in front of the attorney general.”


does raise the question of why Trump would want to do this, but don't see how it points to wanting to obstruct investigation

also


http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/james-comey-memos-testimony/index.html
	When the door by the grandfather clock closed, 


the taping device must be in the grandfather clock!!! (but seriously why does he keep mentioning that)


	The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information -- a concern I shared and still share. 


some context--Trump at this time thought USIC was leaking about him, Congress was asking Comey in particular about it, Comey dodging questions

but there is one explanation for Trump wanting to speak with Comey alone

Comey was the last holdover from Obama for one



But this guy makes a point of saying Comey fired for "Russia investigation," not Flynn:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/james-b-comey-lays-out-the-case-that-president-trump-obstructed-justice/2017/06/08/e7f49a42-4c4d-11e7-bc1b-fddbd8359dee_story.html
	Comey allowed, under questioning from Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho), that Trump did not outright give him an order on Flynn.

	“He did not direct you to let it go?” Risch asked.

	“Not in his words, no,” Comey said. 


But this would mean Comey is contradicting himself... but anyway...

	But Comey later said he took the president’s assertion as akin to a command.

	“I took it as a direction,” Comey said. “This is the president of the United States, with me alone, saying ‘I hope this.’ ”


	Barak Cohen, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice at Perkins Coie, said he believed Comey was “walking a fine line” by “trying to convey how he interpreted the president, but also admitting that there might have been other ways to interpret what the president said.”

	But Comey’s assessment of the situation, he said, was critically important.

	“He was there; he heard the president’s tone and saw his body language — things that shape whatever the president was trying to express,” Cohen said. “That’s why direct evidence of someone who witnesses an alleged crime is so important.”


That's the problem... can you impeach Trump based off how Comey feels about it when Comey is a liar?

And how he feels about it certainly doesn't say much about Trump's intent either...


------


Another take on Comey's case:


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/opinion/comey-trump-obstruction-of-justice.html?mcubz=0
	In recent weeks, some have suggested that President Trump’s controversial interactions with James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, did not constitute wrongdoing. As an ex-criminal defense lawyer and a former federal corruption prosecutor, now joined together as government watchdogs, we beg to differ. Mr. Comey’s sworn statement and answers before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee now provide strong evidence that President Trump committed obstruction of justice. But we have miles to go before that case is legally resolved one way or the other — if it ever is.

	The crime of obstruction requires an attempt to block an investigation with corrupt intent. Mr. Comey has now given us direct witness testimony of obstruction by the president in the form of the already famous statement “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” Mr. Comey repeatedly added in today’s questioning that “I took it as a direction” that “this is what he wants me to do.” In a system governed by the rule of law, shutting down an investigation to benefit a friend — or perhaps, to keep damaging information that friend may know from emerging — is corrupt.


So these ppl going for the Flynn route

	Under probing questioning, with much less senatorial filibustering than is usual, Mr. Comey began answering the many questions that Congress and the special counsel will be grappling with for some time to come. He had to explain how he could be positive the president was giving him a direction (he conceded that was his interpretation). He had to justify why he didn’t tell the president the Flynn request was wrong (he was “stunned”). At one point, Mr. Comey even forgot the exact words the president said to him about Mr. Flynn.


a problem...


	The final reason this will take time is because of the agonizing legal and political decisions that will need to be made after the evidence has been collected. Having worked with and against the F.B.I. special counsel , Robert Mueller, on previous cases, we know he will wrestle as thoughtfully as the special prosecutor Leon Jaworski did, when he had to decide whether he could indict Richard Nixon if the evidence justified it. Mr. Jaworski believed he could, and we agree, but many others differ.


meaning run-out the clock so Trump stays-on for 4 years?


	The alternative, a congressional decision to impeach, if justified, would require many Republicans to turn on their own president. Recall that it took the Republicans years to sour on President Nixon. Today’s Republicans may follow suit, but it will not be quick.

	WASHINGTON — The testimony by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey that President Trump, before firing him last month, demanded loyalty, urged him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser and pressed him to “lift the cloud” of the Russia inquiry is fueling accusations that the president obstructed justice.

	UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you at any time urge former FBI director James Comey to close the investigation into Michael Flynn?

	[05:58:05] DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No. Next question. 




	...He says that the president then said, "'I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' I replies only that 'He is a good guy.' I did not say I would let this go." I mean, it's fascinating. All of these are fascinating, David, to read, particularly once again, we see President Trump's dedication to Michael Flynn, who had lied to the vice president.

	DAVID GREGORY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, that's right. And in this particular case, Donald Trump is contradicted by his own words, because he denied ever having that conversation with Jim Comey. And he made that assertion in a press conference. 


wait he did or is this CNN spin machine


	CUOMO: Interesting. Heading into it, this notion of it being a credibility contest. And the latest polls have both of these guys being unbelievable. Comey at, like, 55 percent. And the president much harder -- much higher than that. Just shows what a deficit of credibility we have right now.


sounds right


------

Comey was confused by Trump's shifting explanations on why he was fired. Trump repeatedly told Comey he was doing a great job, heard great things about him from the Attorney General and others, and hoped he would stay as Director [4]. Trump was lying when he said Comey was a poor leader of the FBI and that the FBI was in disarray and had lost confidence in Comey [5].

At first, Comey didn't know that Trump fired him because of the Russia investigation, but after watching his interview with Lester Holt, Comey saw that Trump said he fired him because of the Russia investigation, and Comey takes him at his word [1][6]. Trump fired Comey to change how the investigation was being conducted [3][2].

Other than media reports, Comey is not aware of any attempts by Trump to reach out to Admiral Rogers, DNI Coats, or DCI Pompeo to publicly exonerate Trump or intervene with the FBI regarding the FBI's investigation [7].

Comey first met Trump on Janurary 6th, when he briefed Trump on the "dodgy dossier." Part of the reason to brief Trump on the dossier was that Trump might be being blackmailed by the Russians [21]. During this briefing, Comey let Trump know he was not under investigation [22].

Trump called Comey on March 30 and described the Russia investigation as a "cloud" that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country [9]. Comey interpreted Trump as saying the investigation was draining his time and energy and making it harder for him to focus on other priorities [10]. Trump expressed to Comey that he had nothing to do with Russia and wanted the FBI to do the Russia investigation and get all the facts out. Trump specifically asked Comey to get out that he personally was not under investigation [13], and expressed that it would be good to find out if his surrogates did something wrong or clear their names too [8].

Immediately after this, Trump turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director McCabe and mentioned he hadn't brought up "the McCabe thing" because Comey said McCabe was honorable, even though McCabe had accepted Campaign donations from the Clintons under suspicious circumstances [34]. Trump said he was rough on McCabe on the campaign trail, and asked Comey how McCabe was going to be with Trump as President [33]. Trump finished the call by emphasizing his problems with "the cloud" and expressing his hopes Comey could find a way to make public Trump wasn't being investigated. Comey told Trump he'd see what we can do [35][36]. Comey did not tell Trump that the FBI and DOJ didn't want to publicly reveal Trump was not under investigation, in part because that would create a duty to correct if that changed [41][42].

Trump asked Comey "lift the cloud" during the March 30 call and complained about the "cloud" again during an April 11th phone call. Comey interpreted "the cloud" to mean the Russia investigation in general [11], and Comey understood Trump to be requesting that the Russia investigation be dropped [12]. The March 30 phone call was the third time Comey let Trump know he was not under investigation [20].

Comey thinks he told Trump he was not under investigation during the April 11th call too [37]. During that call, Trump wanted to know what Comey had done about his request to make public that Trump was not under investigation [38]. Trump tried to remind Comey that he had "been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know." Comey was curious what Trump meant by "that thing" but didn't ask him [39]. At the end of the call, Comey told Trump to take his request to Boente and Trump agreed [40].

There have been lots of news stories about the Russia investigation and collusion that get the facts wrong [14]. Specifically, one could characterize the February 14th New York Times story "Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence" as "almost entirely wrong." [15] The story alleged extensive electronic surveillance, and that upset Comey so much that he surveyed the intelligence community to see if he was missing something. Comey sought out Republican and Democrat Senators to let them know the story had factual errors [16].

Comey believes Trump asked him to drop the investigation into Flynn [17]. When Trump asked Comey to "let Flynn go" at the February 14th Oval Office meeting, Comey perceived this as an order [18][24]. If Comey did what Trump wanted, he would have dropped any open criminal investigation into Flynn's contacts with the Russians [19]. Comey believes it is unlikely that closing the investigation into Flynn would have impeded the Russia investigation [25].

Comey did not in any way initiate the Jan 27th dinner meeting with Trump [23], and Trump was not describing the situation accurately when he said Comey "wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on" [24]. Trump began the dinner by asking if Comey wanted to stay as FBI director, then asked Comey for loyalty specifically in the context of asking him to stay. Trump had already asked Comey to stay three times, and Comey saw Trump's request for loyalty as a way to get something in exchange for letting Comey keep his job and create a patronage relationship [29]. At the end of the dinner, Trump asked Comey for "honest loyalty, and Comey went along with it [30][31].

During the dinner, Trump reacted strongly to the "dodgy dossier" and told Comey he was tempted to order him to investigate it. The January 27th dinner was the second time Comey told Trump he was not under investigation [28], and Trump did not ask Comey to back off the Flynn investigation at the dinner [27].

	SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, I just want you to know that I have great respect for you. Senator Cornyn and I sit on the judiciary committee and we have the occasion to have you before us. You're a man of strength and I regret the situations we all find ourselves in. I just want to say that. Let me begin with one overarching question. Why do you believe you were fired?

	COMEY: I guess I don't know for sure. I believe — I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didn't know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe he's saying something that's not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 


2.
	COMEY: I don't know that I can agree to that level of detail. There's no doubt it's a fair judgment. It's my judgment I was fired because of the Russia investigation.  I was fired in some way to change — or the endeavor was to change the way the Russia investigation is being conducted. That is a very big deal. 


3.
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: Do you believe the Russia investigation played a role?

	COMEY: In why I was fired?

	FEINSTEIN: Yes.

	COMEY: Yes. I've seen the president say so. 


4.
	But then the explanations, the shifting explanations, confused me and increasingly concerned me. They confused me because the president and I had had multiple conversations about my job, both before and after he took office, and he had repeatedly told me I was doing a great job, and he hoped I would stay. And I had repeatedly assured him that I did intend to stay and serve out the years of my term. He told me repeatedly that he had talked to lots of people about me, including our current Attorney General, and had learned that I was doing a great job, and that I was extremely well-liked by the FBI workforce. 

5.
	And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.

6.
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation, and learned again from the media that he was telling privately other parties that my firing had relieved great pressure on the Russian investigation.



7.
REED: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Director Comey. There have been press reports that the president, in addition to asking to you drop the Flynn investigation has asked other senior intelligence officials to take steps which would tend to undermine the investigation of Russia. There are reports that he's asked Dan Coats and Mike Rogers to make public statements exonerating him or taking the pressure off of him. And also reports about Admiral Rogers and Director Pompeo to intervene and reach out to the FBI to ask them. Are you aware of any of these -- do you have any information with respect to any of these allegations?

COMEY: I don't. I'm aware of the public reporting but I had no contact. No conversation with any of those leaders about that subject. 


8.
	RUBIO: On a number of occasions here, you bring up — let's talk about the general Russia investigation, OK? Page 6 of your testimony you say, the first thing you say is, he asked what we could do to, quote, unquote, lift the cloud, the general Russia investigation, you responded, we are investigating the matter as quickly as we could and there would be great benefit if we didn't find anything for having done the work well. He agreed. He emphasized the problems it was causing him. He agreed it'd be great to have an investigation, all the facts came out and we found nothing. He agreed that would be ideal, but this cloud is still messing up my ability to do the rest of my agenda. Is that an accurate assessment? 

	COMEY: Yes, sir. He went farther than that. He said, and if some of my satellites did something wrong, it'd be good to find that out.

	RUBIO: That is the second part. The satellites, if one of my satellites, I imagine he meant some of the people surrounding his campaign, did something wrong, it'd be great to know that, as well.

	COMEY: Yes, sir. That's what he said.

	RUBIO: Are those the only two instances in which that back and forth happened, where the president was basically saying, and I'm paraphrasing here, it's okay. Do the Russia investigation. I hope it all comes out. I have nothing to do with anything Russia. It'd be great if it all came out, people around me were doing things that were wrong?

	COMEY: Yes. As I recorded it accurately there. That was the sentiment he was expressing. Yes, sir. 



9.

http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
	On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as “a cloud” that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. 


10.
	FEINSTEIN: You describe two phone calls that you received from president trump. One on March 30th and one on April 11. He, quote, described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability, end quote, as president, and asked you, quote, to lift the cloud, end quote. How did you interpret that? What did you believe he wanted you to do?

	COMEY: I interpreted that as he was frustrated that the Russia investigation was taking up so much time and energy. I think he meant of the executive branch, but in the public square in general. It was making it difficult for him to focus on other priorities of his. But what he asked me was actually narrowing than that. I think what he meant by the cloud — and, again, I could be wrong — but the entire investigation is taking up oxygen and making it hard for me to focus on what I want to focus on. The ask was to get it out that I, the president, am not personally under investigation. 

11.

	RUBIO: On the cloud, we keep talking about this cloud, you perceive the cloud to be the Russian investigation in general?

	COMEY: Yes, sir. 

12.

	FEINSTEIN: After April 11th, did he ask you more ever about the Russia investigation? Did he ask you any questions?

	COMEY: We never spoke again after April 11th.

	FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

	COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general. 

	FEINSTEIN: So I want to go into that. Who did you talk with about that, lifting the cloud, stop the investigation back at the FBI, and what was their response?

	COMEY: The FBI, during one of the two conversations — I'm not remembering exactly — I think the first, my chief of staff was sitting in front of me and heard my end of the conversation because the president's call was a surprise. I discussed the lifting the cloud and the request with the senior leadership team who, typically, and I think in all the circumstances, was the deputy director, my chief of staff, the general counsel, the deputy director's chief counsel and, I think in a number of circumstances, the number three in the FBI and a few of the conversations included the head of the national security branch. The group of us that lead the FBI when it comes to national security.

	FEINSTEIN: You have the president of the United States asking you to stop an investigation that is an important investigation. What was the response of your colleagues?

	COMEY: I think they were as shocked and troubled by it as I was. Some said things that led me to believe that. I don't remember exactly. But the reaction was similar to mine. They're all experienced people who never experienced such a thing, so they were very concerned. Then the conversation turned to about, so what should we do with this information? That was a struggle for us. Because we are the leaders of the FBI, so it's been reported to us, and I heard it and now shared it with the leaders of the FBI, our conversation was, should we share this with any senior officials at the justice department? Our primary concern was, we can't infect the investigative team. We don't want the agents and analysts working on this to know the president of the united States has asked, and when it comes from the president, I took it as a direction, to get rid of this investigation because we're not going to follow that request. So we decided, we have to keep it away from our troops.

	Is there anyone else we ought to tell at the justice department? We considered whether to tell -- the attorney general said we believe rightly he was shortly going to recuse. There was no other senate confirmed leaders in the justice department at that point. The deputy attorney general was Mr. Boente, acting shortly in the seat. We decided the best move would be to hold it, keep it in a box, document it, as we'd already done, and this investigation is going to do on. Figure out what to do with it down the road. Is there a way to corroborate it? It was our word against the president's. No way to corroborate this. My view of this changed when the prospect of tapes was raised. That's how we thought about it then. 

13.
	LANKFORD: I was interested in your comment that you made as well that the president said to you if there were some satellite associates of his that did something wrong, it would be good to find that out. Did the president seem to talk to you specifically on March 30th saying I'm frustrated that the word is not getting out that I'm under investigation. But if there are people in my circle that are, let's finish the investigation, is that how you took it?

	COMEY: Yes, sir. Yes. 


14.
	LANKFORD: OK. You had mentioned before about some news stories and news accounts. Without having to go into all of the names and specific times and to be able to dip into all of that. Have there been news accounts about the Russian investigation or collusion about the whole event or as you read the story you were wrong about how wrong they got the facts?

	COMEY: Yes, there have been many, many stories based on — well, lots of stuff but about Russia that are dead wrong. 


15.

	COTTON: On February 14th the New York Times published the story, the headline of which was “Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence.” You were asked if that as an inaccurate story. Would it be fair to characterize that story as almost entirely wrong?

	COMEY: Yes. 


16.

	RISCH: I remember, you talked with us shortly after February 14th, when the "New York Times" wrote an article that suggested that the trump campaign was colluding with the Russians. Do you remember reading that article when it first came out?

	COMEY: I do, it was about allegedly extensive electronic surveillance in their communications.

	RISCH: Correct. That upset you to the point where you surveyed the intelligence community to see whether you were missing something in that. Is that correct?

	COMEY: That's correct. I want to be careful in open setting, but —

	RISCH: I'm not going to go any further than that, so thank you. In addition to that, after that, you sought out both Republican and Democrat senators to tell them that, hey, I don't know where this is coming from, but this is not the case. This is not factual. Do you recall that?

	COMEY: Yes.

	RISCH: Okay. So again, so the American people can understand this, that report by the New York Times was not true. Is that a fair statement?

	COMEY: In the main, it was not true. And again, all of you know this. Maybe the American people don't. The challenge, and I'm not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information, is the people talking about it often don't really know what's going on, and going on are not talking about it. We don't call the press to say, hey, you don't that thing wrong about the sensitive topic. We have to leave it there. 


17.
	KING: In his press conference May 18th, the president responded, quote, no, no, when asked about asking you to stop the investigation into general Flynn. Is that a true statement?

	COMEY: I don't believe it is. 


18.
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	RUBIO: And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia investigation, he was asking specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself?

	COMEY: That's how I understood it. Yes, sir.

	RUBIO: As you perceived it, while he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given the setting, the position and some of the circumstances?

	COMEY: Yes. 


19.
	WYDEN: Your testimony was that the president's request about Flynn could infect investigation. Had the president got what he wanted and what he asked of you, what would have been the effect on the investigation?

	COMEY: We would have closed any investigation of general Flynn in connection with his statements and encounters -- statements about encounters with Russians in the late part of December. We would have dropped an open criminal investigation. 


20.
	COLLINS: There was the March 30th phone call with the president in which you reminded him that congressional leaders had been briefed that we were no personally — the FBI was not personally investigating president trump. And, again, was that statement to congressional leaders and to the president limited to counterintelligence investigations, or was it a broader statement? I'm trying to understand whether there was any kind of investigation of the president underway.

	COMEY: No. I'm sorry. If I misunderstood, I apologize. We briefed the congressional leadership about what Americans we had opened counterintelligence investigation cases on. We specifically said, the president is not one of those Americans. But there was no other investigation of the president that we were not mentioning at that time. The context was, counterintelligence, but I wasn't trying to hide some criminal investigation of the president. 


21.
http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/07/politics/james-comey-memos-testimony/index.html
	The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.


22.
	SEN. SUSAN COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, let me begin by thanking you for your voluntary compliance with our request to appear before this committee and assist us in this very important investigation. I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that assurance. Is that correct?

	COMEY: That's correct. 


23.
	KING: With regard to the — several of these conversations, in his interview with Lester Holt on NBC, the president said, I had dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. Is this an accurate statement?

	COMEY: No, sir.

	KING: Did you in any way initiate that dinner?

	COMEY: No. 


24.
	KING: All right. We'll be having a closed session shortly so we'll follow up on that. In terms of his comments to you about — I think in response to Senator Risch, he said, I hope you'll hold back on that, but when you get a — when a president of the United States in the Oval Office says something like, I hope or I suggest or would you, do you take that as a directive?

	COMEY: Yes. It rings in my ear as, well, will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest.

	KING: I was just going to quote that, in 1179, December 27th, Henry II said, who will rid me of the meddlesome priest, and the next day, he was killed. Exactly the same situation. We're thinking along the same lines.


25.
	KING: Back to Mr. Flynn. Would the — would closing out the Flynn investigation have impeded the overall Russian investigation?

	COMEY: No. Well, unlikely, except to the extent — there is always a possibility if you have a criminal case against someone and squeeze them, flip them and they give you information about something else. But I saw the two as touching each other but separate. 


26.
	KING: With regard to the — several of these conversations, in his interview with Lester Holt on NBC, the president said, I had dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. Is this an accurate statement?

	COMEY: No, sir. 


27.
	HEINRICH: As you're very aware, it was only the two of you in the room for that dinner. You told us the president asked you to back off the Flynn investigation. The president told a reporter —

	COMEY: Not in that dinner. 


28.
	COLLINS: Then on the January 27th dinner, you told the president that he should be careful about asking you to investigate because, “you might create a narrative that we are investigating him personally, which we weren't.” Again, were you limiting that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or more broadly, such as a criminal investigation?

	COMEY: I didn't modify the word investigation. It was, again, he was reacting strongly against the unverified material, saying I'm tempted to order you to investigate it. In the context of that, I said, sir, be careful about it. I might create a narrative we're investigating you personally. 


29.
	WARNER: Let me move to the January 27th dinner, where you said "The president began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI director.”

	He also indicated that “lots of people" again your words, "Wanted the job." You go on to say the dinner itself was "Seemingly an effort to" to quote have you ask him for your job and create some "patronage" relationship. The president seems from my reading of your memo to be holding your job or your possibility of continuing your job over your head in a fairly direct way. What was your impression, and what did you mean by this notion of a patronage relationship?

	COMEY: Well, my impression, and again it's my impression, I could always be wrong but my common sense told me what was going on is, either he had concluded or someone had told him that you didn't, you've already asked Comey to stay, and you didn't get anything for it. And that the dinner was an effort to build a relationship, in fact, he asked specifically, of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay. As I said, what was odd about that is we'd already talked twice about it by that point and he said I very much hope you'll stay. In fact, I just remembered sitting a third, when you've seen the. IC tour of me walking across the blue room, and what the president whispered in my ear was "I really look forward to working with you." So after those encounters —

	WARNER: That was a few days before your firing.

	COMEY: On the Sunday after the inauguration. The next Friday I have dinner and the president begins by wanting to talk about my job and so I'm sitting there thinking wait a minute three times we've already, you've already asked me to stay or talked about me staying. My common sense, again I could be wrong but my common sense told me what's going on here is, he's looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job. 


30.
	RUBIO: What it comes down to is the president asked three things of you. Asked for your loyalty. You said you'd be loyally honest.

	COMEY: Honestly loyal. 

31.
	REED: Now, again, also, you've testified that the president asked you repeatedly to be loyal to him. And you responded you'd be honestly loyal. Which is your way of saying I'll be honest and I'll be ahead of the FBI independent, is that fair?

	COMEY: Correct. I tried honest first. And also, you see it in my testimony. I also tried to explain to him why it's in his interest and every president's interest for the FBI to be apart, in a way, because it's credibility is important to a president and total country. And so, I tried to hold the line. Hold the line. It got very awkward. And then I said you'll always have honesty from me. He said honest loyalty. And I then I proceeded with that as I saw that as a way to add this awkwardness. 

32.
	COLLINS: Then on the January 27th dinner, you told the president that he should be careful about asking you to investigate because, “you might create a narrative that we are investigating him personally, which we weren't.” Again, were you limiting that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or more broadly, such as a criminal investigation?

	COMEY: I didn't modify the word investigation. It was, again, he was reacting strongly against the unverified material, saying I'm tempted to order you to investigate it. In the context of that, I said, sir, be careful about it. I might create a narrative we're investigating you personally. 


33.
	RUBIO: On March 30th during the phone call about general Flynn, you said he abruptly shifted and brought up something that you call, quote, unquote, the McCabe thing. Specifically, the Mccabe thing as you understood it was that Mccabe's wife had received campaign money from what I assume means Terry McAuliffe?

	COMEY: Yes.

	RUBIO: Close to the Clintons. Did he say, I don't like this guy because he got money from someone close to Clinton?

	COMEY: He asked me about McCabe and said, how is he going to be with me as president? I was rough on him on the campaign trail.

	RUBIO: Rough on Mccabe?

	COMEY: By his own account, he said he was rough on McCabe and Mrs. McCabe on the campaign trail. How is he going to be? I shared with the president, Andy is a pro. No issue at all. You have to know people of the FBI. They're not — 


34.
http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
	In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn’t brought up “the McCabe thing” because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe’s wife) campaign money. Although I didn’t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person.


35.
http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
 	He finished by stressing “the cloud” that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn’t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.

36.
	FEINSTEIN: You told the president, I would see what we could do. What did you mean?

	COMEY: It was kind of a cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, we're not going to do that. That I would see what we could do. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly, and then I turned and handed it to the acting deputy attorney general. 


37.
	BLUNT: Six weeks later were still telling the president on March the 30th that he was not personally the target of any investigation?

	COMEY: Correct. On March the 30th, and I think again on April 11th, as well, I told him we're not investigating him personally. That was true. 


38.
http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531643428/comey-opening-statement-for-senate-intelligence-hearing-annotated
	On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I “get out” that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that “the cloud” was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel.

39.
	McCAIN: So both President Trump and former candidate Clinton are both involved in the investigation, yet one of them, you said, there's going to be no charges. And the other one, the investigation continues. Well, I think there's a double standard there to tell you the truth. Then when the president said to you, he talked about the April 11th phone call, he said, quote, because I've been very loyal to you. Very loyal. We had that thing, you know. Does that arouse your curiosity as to what quote that thing was?

	COMEY: Yes.

	McCAIN: Why didn't you ask him?

	COMEY: It didn't seem to me to be important for the conversation we were having to understand that I took it to be some — an effort to communicate to me this — that there is a relationship between us where I've been good to you, you should be good to me. 

40.

He said he would do that and added, “Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.” I did not reply or ask him what he meant by “that thing.” I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.

	I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, “We need to get that fact out.” (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.)

	REED: You testified that the president asked you to lift the cloud by especially making public statements dishonoring him and perhaps others, and you refused, correct?

	COMEY: I didn't do it. I didn't refuse the president. I told him we would see what we can do. The second time he called. I told him in substance, that's something your lawyer will have to take up with the Justice Department.

	REED: And part of the underlying logic as we discussed many times throughout this morning is the duty to correct. That is one of a theoretical issue but also a very practical issue. Was there — your feeling that the direction on the investigation could in fact include the president?

	COMEY: Well, in theory. I mean, as I explained, the concern of one of my senior leader colleagues was, if you're looking at potential coordination between the campaign and Russia, the person at the head of the campaign is the candidate. So, logically, this person argued the candidate's knowledge, understanding, would logically become a part of your inquiry if it proceeds. So, I understand that argument. But my view was that what I said to the president was accurate and fair. And fair to him. I resisted the idea of publicly saying it. Although if the Justice Department had wanted to I would have done it because of the duty to correct and the slippery slope problem.

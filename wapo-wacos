 	White House offers shifting explanations of Trump’s disclosures to Russians 
	By Greg Miller and Ashley Parker

	Trump also enlisted his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, to help contain the fallout from the latest damaging revelations about the administration’s relationship with Russia. Trump revealed the classified intelligence in a White House meeting with Russia’s foreign minister and ambassador one day after firing FBI Director James B. Comey over frustration with the bureau’s investigation of any ties between Trump associates and Russian officials.

	Speaking to reporters at the White House, McMaster refused to say whether Trump had shared classified information with the representatives from Moscow, falling back on a refrain that Trump’s disclosures were “wholly appropriate.”

 	A new role for McMaster: Trump’s shield 

	By Greg Jaffe

	...The biggest burden for McMaster, though, may be own words as captured in “Dereliction of Duty.” “The president was lying, and he expected the Chiefs to lie as well or, at least, to withhold the whole truth,” McMaster wrote in the book’s epilogue, referring to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Although the president should not have placed the Chiefs in that position, the flag officers should not have tolerated it when they had.”

	...McMaster made only brief mention of the recent terrorist attacks in England, expressing sympathy for the victims and promising American support. But he went out of his way to praise Trump’s recent trip to NATO’s headquarters in which the president scolded European allies for not spending more on defense.

Talking head (Bennen?):

	"investigative interest": We will dig into what that means in a moment--we have one of the authors of this peice, reporter Adam Entous, here, for this development.


3:40

	tying to the sechelles meeting

8:40

	The obvious question? Why Russia? The country 

	Why indeed...


9:00

	Entous: We got this letter december 12, says there was a meeting at Trump tower between Kislyak, FLynn, Kusher, described what was said in the meeting, that Kushner wanted to have a secret back-chanell, didn't say anything about using Russian equipement, wanted a back-channell in a third country


	What happened is we had no reason to believe this letter was authentic

	Wasn't until March, New Yorker reported Kislyak was in this meeting in Trump tower

	I Called White House, asked them date of the meeting, matched letter


12:34

	We all heard the story of the so-called prauge meeting which took place--which was a lot earlier

Entous a fan of the dossier?

	While there, Page allegedly met with Igor Sechin, a Putin confidant and chief executive of the energy company Rosneft, according to a dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer and cited at a congressional hearing by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Officials said some of the information in the dossier has been verified by U.S. intelligence agencies, and some of it hasn’t, while other parts are unlikely to ever be proved or disproved.

	On Tuesday, Page dismissed what he called “the dodgy dossier” of false allegations.

 	Top intelligence official told associates Trump asked him if he could intervene with Comey on FBI Russia probe 

	By Adam Entous June 6

	The nation’s top intelligence official told associates in March that President Trump asked him if he could intervene with then-FBI Director James B. Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe, according to officials.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/
	DURBIN: I guess I want to also go to the question which keeps gnawing at me here that Mr. McGahn asked of you. Is there anything wrong with one White House official lying to another White House official?

	YATES: Well, to be fair to Mr. McGahn here, I wouldn't say that he said is there anything wrong. His question was more essentially what's it to the Justice Department if one White House official is lying to another? In other words, why is this something that DOJ would be concerned about? And that's why went back through the list of issues and reasons why this was troubling to us.

	DURBIN: Did you think there was a legal reason to be concerned if one White House official lied to another White House official?

	YATES: We didn't go into that. And to the extent you may be talking about like 1001 violation, that was not something that we were alluding to or discussing with Mr. McGahn. I think his point when he made that point to me was that he wasn't sure why the Department of Justice would care about one lying to another, not to be discussing whether that was in fact a crime.

	After the encounter, Coats discussed the conversation with other officials and decided that intervening with Comey as Trump had suggested would be inappropriate, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters.


so, saying intervening "get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Micheal Flynn?"

	...Coats will testify on Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Lawmakers on the panel said they would press him for information about his interactions with the president regarding the FBI investigation.


http://www.npr.org/2017/06/07/531897778/intelligence-leaders-testify-before-senate-panel-hearing
	DAN COATS: I have never been pressured. I have never felt pressure to intervene or interfere in any way with shaping intelligence in a political way or in relationship to an ongoing investigation.


https://www.lawfareblog.com/highlights-russia-investigation-todays-senate-intelligence-committee-hearing
	HEINRICH: You realize, and obviously this is not releasing any classified information, you realize how simple it would be to simply be to say no, that never happened? Why is it inappropriate, Director Coats?

	COATS: I think conversations between the President and myself are for the most part—

	HEINRICH: You seem to apply that standard selectively.

	COATS: No, I’m not applying it selectively. I’m just saying I don’t think it’s appropriate—

	HEINRICH: You can clear an awful lot up—

	COATS: I don't share with the general public conversations that I have with the president or many of my colleagues within the administration that I believe are—should not be shared.

	HEINRICH: I think your unwillingness to answer a very basic question speaks volumes.

	...BLUNT: And you would characterize your quote as no effort to impede the Russian investigation as still accurate?

	McCABE: That’s correct.


what is Coats trynig to do? try for the "USIC deep state undermining President" schtick? leave options open that Trump may be guilty?

And why is he denying this when he answered already?



McCabe saying his conversations with Comey are part of the Special Counsel's investigation


https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/17-49_05-23-17.pdf
	Senator Reed:  There are other allegations in the article which suggests that either the President or White House personnel contacted other people in the intelligence community with requests to drop the investigation into General Flynn.  Are you aware of any other contacts, not just yourself personally but to others in the intelligence community to conduct such activity? 

     Mr. Coats:  I am not aware of that.  


well there you go

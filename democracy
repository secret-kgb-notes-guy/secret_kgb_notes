	Primary elections in the United States generally draw a very low voter turnout. In addition, only a small portion of the public may be educated on the issue stances of all primary candidates, as primary elections typically use little or no mass media advertising. Party activists, ideologues, and local party leaders may constitute an unusually high number of, or exert disproportionate levels on influence on, those who actually vote.

	My understanding from talking to people down in Richmond was that the real issues seem to be that he wasn’t strongly enough anti-immigration reform, that he voted to end the government shutdown and he voted to raise the debt ceiling," Bobbie Kilberg, who heads the Northern Virginia Technology Council and held a May fundraiser for Cantor, told TIME. "And you know, at some point in time, these people need to understand you just simply have to govern. These people need to understand that we need immigration reform. And these people need to understand that Eric Cantor was a conservative on all those issues. He was a mainstream conservative."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brat
	Brat ran well to Cantor's right, complaining that Cantor had a "crony-capitalist mentality", putting the interests of the corporate sector ahead of small businesses.[28] Radio talk show host Laura Ingraham endorsed Brat's candidacy and hosted a rally with him in a Richmond suburb.[1] Brat was also supported by radio talk show host Mark Levin[29] and Ann Coulter.[30] Chris Peace, a state legislator who collaborated with Brat on state budget issues at Randolph-Macon College, stated that Brat was inspired to run for Congress because of "His passion for the structure of government and belief in free markets."

kindof odd?

Don't they correct for these biases? i.e. get democraphic information, scale responses by democraphic.

Shepard is saying there's a hidden variable that's not accounted for, but which exactly? "shy voter?"

	It’s too early to say for sure that this explains Democrats’ struggles over the past two election cycles — or that these issues will still be relevant in 2017 and 2018. Most Democrats — along with Republicans and nonpartisan analysts — are waiting for more states to collect and publish data of which voters did and did not cast ballots, a process expected to conclude later this spring. 

hmmmm....

Did pre-election polling match exit-polling?

	Still, if the past two decades in Iowa politics prove anything, it’s that King can survive controversy. He’s already fundraising off the backlash against him, declaring, “I refuse to stand down.” And most longtime Iowa political hands think King is pretty much invulnerable.

	“No one will ever get close to him in a general election. It’s too heavily Republican,” says Chris Rants, the state’s former speaker of the house who represented the northwest corner of Iowa for 18 years. “You don’t draw crossover voters. You don’t generally get many moderates in a primary. His comments aren’t going to change anything.”

For the past few years, Congress has managed about a 20% approval rating with a 90% reelection rate. Part of the reason for this is that campaigns need funding and campaign donors overwhelmingly favor incumbents (apparently they have been happy with their purchase), and Congressional districts are typically drawn ("gerrymandered") to favor incumbents.

Another problem is our two-party system: other than in a dozen or so "swing states," most U.S. Congressional elections are decided in the primaries. But incumbents often skate through primaries unopposed, and only 22% of incumbents face more than a "token" challenger. Even for incumbents involved in a serious scandal, the odds of losing the primary or general election have been "well below 50%" (see http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jsnyder/files/primaries_scandals_qjps_note.pdf). It's hard to point to any one reason this happens, but if you dig around you can get some hints:

http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-07-26/news/9507250359_1_ballot-access-law-signatures-minor-party-candidates
	To get on the ballot nationwide, a Democrat presidential contender needs 25,000 voter signatures in several states, none in Florida. A Republican needs 50,000 signatures. But an independent or third-party candidate needs 720,000 signatures.

	That's a huge hurdle, rarely leaped, requiring millions of dollars and a party-like organization, which independent Ross Perot needed in 1992. He won about 1 in every 5 votes - 19.7 million nationally, 1 million in Florida. That's a huge "no confidence" vote in the two-party monopoly. In congressional races, Democrats and Republicans can qualify a full slate of candidates nationally with 140,000 signatures, none in Florida. A third party needs 1.6 million voter signatures.

	In Florida, Democrats and Republicans don't need voter signatures to run for partisan offices. Independent or minor party candidates need signatures of 3 percent of the voters in the state, county or district. That's 197,000 signatures statewide, 19,800 for countywide office in Broward County To fix the problem, Florida and other states should enact reasonable rules for presidential or congressional candidates. To qualify, each candidate, regardless of party label, should have to submit a token number of voter signatures on petitions favoring his candidacy. State lawmakers should set similar rules for candidates for state and local office.

	The need for signatures should only be a way to force candidates to show minimal seriousness of purpose and modest voter support, not a way to block most "outsiders" from qualifying.

	Georgia's petition for US House and state legislature, 5% of the number of registered voters, is so severe, no legislative candidate successfully used the procedure in 2012 except for one candidate for the State House, Bill Bozarth.  Incumbent independents don't need to petition, so Rusty Kidd didn't petition in 2012.  No independent has successfully submitted the 5% petition for US House since 1964, and back in 1964, the petition wasn't due until October, the signatures weren't checked, they didn't need to be notarized, and no filing fee was needed.  In 1964 the law was made worse (effective 1965). The petitions are now due in July, and each sheet must be notarized, and anyone who notarizes any sheets may not petition himself or herself, and a fee equal to 3% of the annual office salary is also needed.  No minor party has ever complied with the 5% petition, which was passed in 1943.  In special elections no petition is needed.  Billy McKinney got on as an independent for one US House in 1982 but because redistricting was late that year, he only needed a 1.3% petition.

	The GOP primary in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District appeared to be the most competitive congressional race in the state this year. But it doesn’t seem nearly as close if campaign reports are any indication.

	Federal Election Commission filings show incumbent U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford had a campaign war chest of more than $900,000 on March 31 – more than 50 times as much as state Rep. Jenny Horne, his June primary challenger.


http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/us/politics/anti-incumbent-super-pac-adds-to-congresss-insecurity.html
	Mr. Bachus, one of the super PAC’s biggest targets, fumed about “these three guys” — Mr. Ricketts, Leo Linbeck III and Tim Dunn, its top donors — who had dropped $250,000 against him.

	Mr. Bachus, who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and has drawn scrutiny for his personal investment practices, said he had asked a friend from Houston to contact Leo Linbeck, the grandfather of group’s largest donor, to no avail.

	Mr. Bonner said he believed he would survive the primary next week, in large part because his campaign war chest far exceeded the money being spent against him.

	“If I hadn’t had $1 million in my account, I could be underwater right now,” he said. “We’ll see next Tuesday, but the response from most people in my district is they’re offended that some out-of-state group hiding behind the cloak of darkness is trying to play in a race in South Alabama.”

	Primaries are a part of life, lawmakers said.

	“There are just a lot of folks who want to be in Congress,” said Representative Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee, a Republican who has multiple challengers in the state’s Congressional primary in August.

	“I have committed myself just to doing my job,” he said, “and I hope and pray in the end my constituents will reward me for that.”


Primary elections are controlled by their political party--private entities which have not shied away from influencing their elections in an undemocratic ways in the past (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/dnc-emails-sanders-clinton.html). And primary elections--the only elections that matter in "Red" or "Blue" states, often exclude large portions of the electorate from voting at all--not very democratic either.

The sum of all this: in 2016, despite an angry electorate, a single incumbent was ousted in a Congressional primary (http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/21/in-year-supposed-angry-electorate-just-one-congressional-incumbent-ousted-in-primary.html).

If we want something more like Democracy in this country, we could do worse to change how our two-party system works. Replacing primaries with a Two-round system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system) might be a good start.

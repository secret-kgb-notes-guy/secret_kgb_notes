Today, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes and Ranking Member Adam Schiff released the following statement:

For many years, one of the House Intelligence Committee’s highest priorities has been to oversee the Intelligence Community’s activities to counter Russian aggression, including the cyber-attacks directed against the United States in the last year.

As part of this oversight responsibility, the Committee has been undertaking a bipartisan inquiry of these activities and the underlying intelligence used to draft the Intelligence Community Assessment, “Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections”. 

While the Committee has already begun to receive important documents, we trust that the incoming leadership of the Intelligence Community will fully and promptly support our requests for information related to the inquiry. It will not be adequate to review these documents, expected to be in the thousands of pages, at the agencies. They should be delivered to the House Intelligence Committee to provide members adequate time to examine their content. 

The scope of the Committee’s inquiry has included, and will continue to include:

    -Russian cyber activity and other “active measures” directed against the U.S. and its allies;
    -Counterintelligence concerns related to Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, including any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns;
    -The United States Government response to these Russian active measures and any impact they may have on intelligence relationships and traditional alliances; and
    -Possible leaks of classified information related to the Intelligence Community’s assessments of these matters.

This issue is not about party, but about country. The Committee will continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead.

QUESTION: Can you say categorically that there were no contacts whatsoever between any officials affiliated with the Russian government and the Trump campaign?

QUESTION: I just want to be really clear, so the FBI specifically told you that they have found no contacts between any Trump associates and Russian officials?

NUNES: Yes, so I want to be -- we're not going to just -- we're going to say the whole I.C. here, I'm not going to get up to specific to any one agency. But as of right now, I don't have -- I don't have any evidence that would -- of any phone calls.

The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls

QUESTION: When the White House asked you about, you know, talking to this reporter, did you know that they had also asked Senator Burr to do the same thing? And did it feel to you like some sort of a coordinated effort to push back?

NUNES: No. I mean, if anything -- if anything, it was the opposite.

As a former adviser and current shareholder in Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled gas company, Page has a personal interest in a relaxation of sanctions against Moscow. But his rambling pro-Putin writings extend far beyond the legitimate debate over the efficacy and morality of using sanctions as a deterrent. In the January 2015 piece, Page conspiratorially asserts that U.S. officials, including Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, secretly fomented the Ukrainian uprising against Yanukovych.  

According to Page’s public online biography, he is a founder and managing partner of Global Energy Capital. He spent seven years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch, and opened its office in Moscow.

U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.

Some of those briefed were “taken aback” when they learned about Page’s contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser’s talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being “actively monitored and investigated.”

MOSCOW — Carter Page, an early foreign policy adviser to Donald J. Trump who was scrutinized by the F.B.I. on suspicion of private communications with senior Russian officials over the summer, was back in Moscow on Thursday.

Mr. Page was closelipped about the purpose of his visit, telling RIA Novosti, a Russian state-run news agency, that he would stay in Moscow until Tuesday and would meet with “business leaders and thought leaders.”

Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital, drew attention during the summer for a speech that criticized the United States and other Western nations for a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” in Russia and in other parts of the former Soviet Union.

Now Mr. Tillerson’s career is igniting a debate over the blending of business and politics — and whether that could tip the scales in Russia’s favor on major policy decisions like the sanctions.

Speaking on Monday in Moscow, Carter Page, a supporter of Mr. Trump who described his former work for the Trump campaign as pulling together “new ideas” on foreign policy, said he was excited that Mr. Tillerson would probably put more of an emphasis on private sector business opportunities in relations between Russia and the United States.

“What makes me excited about new possibilities is the chance to really work on new things to improve more from a business standpoint,” Mr. Page said at a news conference.

During a 2015 trip to Russia, Donald Trump's pick to be national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, said he didn't know whether the 2013 sarin gas attack in Syria was conducted by the Syrian Army or by other forces in an attempt to draw the United States into the conflict.

Flynn not ruling out the possibility of a "false flag" attack raises questions about how the Trump administration will approach the Syrian conflict. The Obama administration, the Arab League, NATO, and many western governments have pointed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime as being responsible for the attack. A United Nations investigation didn't assign blame, but evidence from the report pointed to the Assad regime being responsible.

Assad's regime and Russian President Vladimir Putin claim opposition forces were behind the attack.

His attendance at the RT gala, before which he also gave a talk on world affairs, appeared to inaugurate a relationship with the network—presumably a paid one, though neither Flynn nor RT answered queries on the subject. Flynn now makes semi-regular appearances on RT as an analyst, in which he often argues that the U.S. and Russia should be working more closely together on issues like fighting ISIL and ending Syria’s civil war. “Russia has its own national security strategy, and we have to respect that,” he said in one recent appearance.

A meeting in Paris between Donald Trump’s son and a Syrian politician with strong ties to Russia has strengthened expectations that the new US administration will side with Moscow in the conflict.

...Earlier this month, Assad appeared to give the president-elect a cautious endorsement, saying Trump would be a “natural ally” if he fulfils his pledge to fight “terrorists”.

Several consultants who worked with Manafort during the Yanukovych election say the Republican truly believed in the now-deposed politician’s capabilities as a leader and doubted that his competitors — widely seen as more pro-Western — had more productive aspirations for the country.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html
The counterintelligence investigation centers at least in part on the business dealings that some of the president-elect’s past and present advisers have had with Russia. Mr. Manafort has done business in Ukraine and Russia. Some of his contacts there were under surveillance by the National Security Agency for suspected links to Russia’s Federal Security Service, one of the officials said.

Attached to the text is a note to Paul Manafort referring to “bulletproof” evidence related to Manafort’s financial arrangement with Ukraine’s former president, the pro-Russian strongman Viktor Yanukovych, as well as an alleged 2012 meeting between Trump and a close Yanukovych associate named Serhiy Tulub.

In an interview on ABC's "This Week" that aired Sunday, Trump asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not going to invade Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels — and some Russian special forces — have been operating for several years despite Putin's reluctance to acknowledge any role.

Those meetings at the Republican convention came as questions about Trump’s stance on Russia started to seriously enter campaign trail conversation.

At the time, some GOP delegates were questioning an amendment to the party platform that had been quietly engineered the previous week and appeared to shift party policy in a direction Moscow would appreciate. A provision supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed rebels had been softened, and it was unclear whether the Trump camp had played a role.

Then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, who previously was a paid adviser to a pro-Russian Ukrainian president, told NBC in August that the change “absolutely did not come from the campaign.”

But this week, Gordon, the Trump campaign adviser, offered a different explanation. He said he had advocated for the change, believing it to match Trump’s views. In an email, he said he had consulted about the matter with “campaign policy colleagues” before arriving in Cleveland.

Michael T. Flynn, then Donald J. Trump’s incoming national security adviser, had a previously undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador in December to “establish a line of communication” between the new administration and the Russian government, the White House said on Thursday.

Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and now a senior adviser, also participated in the meeting at Trump Tower with Mr. Flynn and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/despite-early-denials-growing-list-of-trump-camp-contacts-with-russians-haunts-white-house/2017/03/03/a5b196d8-002d-11e7-8f41-ea6ed597e4ca_story.html
Kislyak appears to have worked to cultivate a relationship with the Trump campaign, starting his outreach even before Trump was thought likely to win the GOP nomination.

In April, Kislyak popped up at the Mayflower Hotel, where he was seated in the front row at one of Trump’s first major foreign policy addresses. During the speech, Trump offered a forceful promise that he would seek better relations with Russia.

...Kislyak was also in attendance at the Republican National Convention, where he briefly met Sessions after a July 18 Heritage Foundation event attended by dozens of diplomats.

Two days later, Kislyak met with Trump advisers Carter Page and J.D. Gordon after a convention-related Global Partners in Diplomacy event at Case Western Reserve University.

In an email, Gordon said he briefly spoke to Kislyak in a group of diplomats there and also at an evening reception. Gordon called it a “brief, informal conversation,” during which he repeated public Trump statements about improving relations with Russia.

Page also confirmed his interaction with Kislyak at the event to MSNBC on Thursday. Last month, he told PBS that he had held “no meetings” with any Russian officials during the campaign.

A few minutes before he made those remarks, Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception.

TAPPER: CNN's Evan Perez has reported that the intelligence community, that the U.S. intelligence community believes that Russia's ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, is not just an ambassador, but he is a spy and he's also a spy recruiter. Was that your understanding when you were at the agency?

MCMULLIN: Yes, that is my understanding.

But why it's significant is that you have somebody with enormous access here in Washington as an ambassador engaging with some of our senior-most officials in Congress and elsewhere who also has the skills that a spy would have to extract important information and to help run covert operations.

And, so, that's the kind of person we're dealing with here. It doesn't mean that all Ambassador Kislyak's activities are related to espionage, but it means he is a skilled practitioner of that -- of such operations.

TAPPER: Of spycraft.

MCMULLIN: That's right.

TAPPER: Can you give me just a kind of understanding of what that means exactly? He has skills in persuasion, extracting information when people don't want to give that information? What exactly do you mean?

MCMULLIN: He would have skills in compromising people, first and foremost, so that...

TAPPER: Potentially blackmailing them?

MCMULLIN: Blackmailing, but it's not just blackmail.

It is not as dramatic as that. It's about slowly easing people into a situation in which they are revealing information that they shouldn't reveal, that compromises them, which makes it easier to get additional information and additionally compromise them into the future, until you have something that amounts to a covert operation in which they are working on behalf of you. That's what his job would be.

Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine’s newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Investigators assert that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials.

The agency’s investigation of Mr. Manafort began last spring as an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country’s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. It has focused on why he was in such close contact with Russian and Ukrainian intelligence officials.

In another hacked exchange a few months later with someone else, Andrea Manafort wrote that her father’s “work and payment in Ukraine is legally questionable.”

Jeff Sessions lied during his press conference about lying under oath

On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions held a press conference to address concerns surrounding a report that he may have lied to Congress about his contact with Russian officials during the 2016 election. During his confirmation hearings, Sessions had said, in response to a question from Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), that he never had contacts with the Russians. But, according to the Washington Post, Sessions had two such contacts with Russia's ambassador to Washington.

Business reporter Adam Davidson spent months investigating the Trump Hotel Baku deal, which the Trump Organization cut its ties with a month after Trump's election. In his detailed story for The New Yorker, Davidson writes that Trump did business with corrupt partners who also did business with Iran's Revolutionary Guard. This would be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

It is not enough that Jeff Sessions stepped aside Thursday.

What matters now is that an independent special prosecutor is appointed, one above all partisanship, who is determined to chase down every lead into any and all secret dealings between Russia, Donald Trump and the Trump presidential campaign.

Who in the Trump camp was involved? What exactly are Trump’s past and present business ties to Russia and influential individual Russians? What are his staff and advisers’ ties? What foreign policy understandings may have been reached with a wink and nod? What promises might have been made? Who else knows exactly what?

The stakes are far too high for this investigation to be left to Attorney General Sessions’ deputy or to the Justice Department as a whole, which Sessions will continue to head. And a select committee of Congress would be ill-equipped to take the broadest possible approach.

Only a special prosecutor, enthusiastically endorsed by Congress on both sides of the aisle, will suffice. This investigation must go wherever the truth leads, without reservation.

On Thursday, Sessions removed himself from any investigation amid furor over the revelation that he, during his Senate confirmation hearing, failed to disclose under questioning that he twice had met with the Russian ambassador last year. Sessions’ own actions, including whether he purposely misled the Senate committee, now become part of the federal inquiry.

In ordinary circumstances, Sessions’ recusal would mean the job of investigating Trump’s ties to Russia — and Russia’s tampering in the election — would be turned over to the acting deputy attorney general, Dana Boente, or to the man soon likely to replace Boente as deputy, Rod Rosenstein, pending confirmation by the Senate.

But Boente would be suspect. He was Trump’s choice to replace Obama administration hold-over Sally Yates, whom Trump fired for refusing to enforce his travel ban. Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, also would be suspect, having been nominated by the president.

The only trustworthy way forward is for Boente or Rosenstein to name a special prosecutor of unimpeachable integrity and deep experience — somebody Congress across the board can support. Strictly Republican appointees need not apply.

The heart of the matter is the question of whether an unfriendly foreign power attempted to tilt an American presidential election. As long ago as October, two agencies — the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — said the U.S. intelligence community had concluded that Russia was behind a hacking operation to interfere with the presidential elections. The unanimous view of government intelligence agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, is that the Russian government directed cyber attacks against U.S. political organizations. CNN has reported that multiple sources say high-level Trump associates were in constant contact with Russians who were known to U.S. intelligence.

Yet here we are in March, with no answers. We can’t even say we know all the questions.

Federal investigators have been looking into contacts between Trump advisers and Russia for months. House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting separate investigations. But to say the congressional probes are running at a snail’s pace is unfair to snails.

As for the Trump White House, it is once again in nothing-to-see-here mode, insisting this week that questions about Sessions’ meetings with the Russian ambassador are nothing more than “the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats.” This is an administration with serious messaging issues. Just hours before Sessions announced he would recuse himself, Trump said he did not think his attorney general needed to do so.

In choosing a special prosecutor, we urge the Justice Department and Congress to heed the example of Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. attorney for Northern Illinois, who in 2003 led a strong investigation into a government leak of the name of a CIA operative, Valerie Plame. Fitzgerald’s work, at a time when Republican George W. Bush sat in the White House, led to the conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, Lewis “Scooter” Libby.

Jeff Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself. Whether he might now be compelled to resign remains an open question.

The more pressing matter is to appoint a superb special prosecutor who gives no quarter.

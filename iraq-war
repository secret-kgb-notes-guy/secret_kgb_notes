	The Niger uranium forgeries were forged documents initially released by SISMI (Italian military intelligence), which seem to depict an attempt made by Saddam Hussein in Iraq to purchase yellowcake uranium powder from Niger during the Iraq disarmament crisis. On the basis of these documents and other indicators, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom asserted that Iraq violated United Nations Iraq sanctions by attempting to procure nuclear material for the purpose of creating weapons of mass destruction.


This by KGB?


	No one has been convicted of forging the documents. Various theories have been reported on how they were produced, distributed, and where pressure was applied to keep their fraudulent nature a secret.

	...It is as yet unknown how Italian intelligence came by the documents and why they were not given directly to the U.S. According to a 2003 article in The New Yorker by Seymour Hersh, the forgery may have been a deliberate entrapment by current and former CIA officers to settle a score against Cheney and other neoconservatives.

	The CIA was involved in several ill-fated attempts to get rid of Saddam Hussein, all of which backfired and led to the arrest and/or execution of almost all of its agents there. So the agency didn't have a good network of sources in the country who could either orchestrate an effective regime change or evaluate intelligence. When the Bush Admin ordered the CIA to provide intelligence on supposed al Qaeda connections to Hussein or his presumed WMD program, the agency did what it was told to do, forwarding reports to the White House that it knew were questionable. As I explain in Spooked, by the time some within Langley realized that we were going to invade based in part on those reports, they tried to reach out to certain reporters to raise the alarm, but it was too late.


Saying CIA knew the intel was fake, Bush acted anyway? was "too late" to stop him? interesting

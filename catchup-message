https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/obama-trump-russia-election-hacking.html
	WASHINGTON — In the Obama administration’s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election — and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump and Russians — across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn’t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.

	American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials — and others close to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin — and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/07/kgb-defector-cold-war-vasil-mitrokhin-notes-public
	Mitrokhin copied the files between 1972 and 1984 when he supervised the transfer of the KGB's foreign intelligence archives from the Lubyanka to its new headquarters in Moscow. He smuggled out his notes, typed them up in his dacha, and hid them under the floorboards.

	In 1992, he took the overnight train to Riga dressed as what was described a street pedlar, hiding a sample of his documents under old clothes and sausages. He went first to the US embassy but was put off by the long visa queue there.

	He then went to the UK embassy where he was put in touch with a young member of the staff who asked him: "Would you like a cup of tea?", before getting in touch with MI6 who later exfiltrated him and his family. Mitrokhin died in Britain in 2004. Asked about what kind of man he was, Andrew described experiencing the former KGB's officer's feeling of relief – that of a someone who, in the Soviet Union, had not been able to confide in anybody but himself for as many as 30 years.

	We're on the brink of potentially having two European countries where Russia is the disrupter of their leadership. What we might assess as a very covert effort in 2016 in the United States is a very overt effort as well as covert in Germany, France, already been tried in Montenegro, the Netherlands. We feel part of our responsibility is to educate the rest of the world about what's going on.

http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ryan-u-s-responsibility-stop-russian-influence-article-1.3013605
	House Speaker Paul Ryan said the United States has a “special responsibility” to stop Russian attempts to influence elections across the globe.

	...“So we all knew this before the election,” he said. “We all knew, Russia was trying to meddle with our election. And we already know right now they are trying to do it with other countries.”

	“So the nation, the world super power, the American government needs to do everything we possibly can not only to undercut what they are trying to do but to uncover what they are trying to do and help our allies prevent this from happening,” Ryan said. “Because with Russia trying to influence elections in Eastern Europe and Europe, around the globe I think we have a special responsibility given our capabilities to make sure we help our allies guard against this meddling by Russia in their elections just like they tried to with our election.”

Other than that, here is a time-line of some important bits of the ongoing Trump-Russia scandal, also with a possible example of active measures by creating "fake scandals:"

https://pastebin.com/nCwti01C


Building off that timeline, here is a write-up of what looks like an instance of obstruction of justice or abuse of power by President Trump:

--------

In my last email (https://pastebin.com/nCwti01C), I mentioned that ill-meaning people could leak misleading information to the press, or misrepresent this information to create fake scandals about President Trump.

According to Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, the Trump Administration has actually tried this before:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/22/the-white-house-is-trying-to-dupe-the-new-york-times-with-phony-leaks/?tid=sm_tw_pp
    Conservative talk show host Bill Mitchell has hatched an ingenious plot to destroy the credibility of major newspapers.

        You know what we should do? Start flooding the NYTimes and WAPO tip lines with all kinds of crazy "leaks." Then laugh when they print them!

         — Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) May 21, 2017

    Simple, right? Mitchell's theory is that the media is so hungry for unflattering information about President Trump that it will gobble up anything that feeds its narrative. When “crazy leaks” make print, Mitchell and his fellow Trump boosters can expose the falsehoods and prove once and for all that the “fake news media,” as the president calls it, is composed of a bunch of hacks.

    It's brilliant! But New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman says the plan won't work.


https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/866374018051584005
    The Trump administration has tried this a few times, sir. We actually vet these things.

    — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) May 21, 2017


And this is corroborated in part by the testimony of Mr. Comey:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/
    COMEY: ...I do think in the last six weeks, couple of months, there's been at least -- apparently a lot of conversation about classified matters that's ending up in the media.

    Now, a lot of it is just dead wrong, which is one of the challenges because we don't correct it, but it does strike me there's been a lot of people talking or at least reporters saying people are talking to them in ways that have struck me as unusually active.


Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Maggie has been doing a good job of vetting her sources:

www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/analysis-pence-filling-key-voids-in-trump-white-house/
    By Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman
    The New York Times

    ...When Flynn was fired in mid-February, Trump and White House officials said that he had misled the vice president about his conversations with Kislyak, which led to an embarrassing television appearance in which an oblivious Pence defended Flynn’s conduct.

    In reality, Trump — convinced by Bannon, Priebus and Kushner — had already decided that Flynn was a liability, and was eager to find an excuse to get rid of him, according to three administration officials familiar with the episode.


Maggie's sources contradict the testimony of Yates from early May:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/
    YATES: ...And, in fact, Mr. McGahn responded back to me to let me know that anything that General Flynn would've said would have been based -- excuse me -- anything that Vice President Pence would have said would have been based on what General Flynn had told him.

    YATES: ...one of the questions that Mr. McGahn asked me when I went back over the second day was essentially, why does it matter to DOJ if one White House official lies to another White House official?

    And so we explained to him, it was a whole lot more than that and went back over the same concerns that we had raised with them the prior day, that the concern first about the underlying conduct itself, that he had lied to the vice president and others, the American public had been misled.

    YATES ...and in fact, I remember specifically saying, you know it wouldn't really be fair of us to tell you this and then expect you to sit on your hands.


The account that Maggie and Thrush dismiss is the same account that Yates gave under oath: Flynn lied to Vice President Pence, leading to Pence misleading the public. If President Trump had "already decided Flynn was a liability," as Maggie's sources allege, why did McGahn go back to ask why it "matter[s] if one White House official lies to another?" And if he wanted to "get rid" of Flynn, why did the President wait two weeks (and one scandal) later to fire Flynn when Yates specifically told the White House this was urgent information for them to act on?

This isn't the only time Maggie has dropped the ball in trusting White House sources:


https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/864592791283912705
    The day after Flynn resigned, POTUS allegedly asked Comey to "let go" of Flynn probe. Explosive @nytmike

    — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) May 16, 2017


Maggie is referring to this May 16 article by Micheal Schmidt:

https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html
    President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting.


Schmidt alleges that President Trump asked Comey to "shut down" the FBI investigation into Flynn. But Comey had previously testified that he had never been asked to stop an investigation for political reasons:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/03/read-the-full-testimony-of-fbi-director-james-comey-in-which-he-discusses-clinton-email-investigation/
    HIRONO: So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?

    COMEY: In theory yes.

    HIRONO: Has it happened?

    COMEY: Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that -- without an appropriate purpose. I mean where oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it. But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience.


Maggie should know better than to call this report "explosive" when it contradicts a testimony given under oath. (Maggie is said to have a long-standing relationship with Trump: http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/07/media/maggie-haberman-trump/index.html)

This is important because the allegation in the NY Times report suggests that President Trump acted to obstruct justice when he fired Mr. Comey. But this is misleading--if Trump did anything to obstruct justice, it was his firing of acting AG Yates.

Recall the timeline of events surrounding President Trump's firing of Yates (https://pastebin.com/nCwti01C):

    Jan 24th: the FBI interviews Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak at the White House

    Jan 26th: Yates warns the White House that Flynn is vulnerable to blackmail for lying to Pence and tells White House Counsel Donald McGahn that the FBI interviewed Flynn.  McGahn asks how Flynn did.

    Jan 27th: McGahn schedules a second meeting with Yates, in part to discuss "applicability of criminal statutes and the likelihood that the Department of Justice would pursue a criminal case."

    Jan 30th: President Trump fires Yates as acting Attorney General.


A few days after President Trump learned Flynn was under FBI investigation, he fired Yates under suspicious circumstances.

The White House certainly knew that Flynn was under investigation before firing Yates, and according to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, the President was briefed on the Flynn situation "immediately" after the DOJ notified McGahn:

https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/14/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-2142017-12
    The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the President to ask for General Flynn’s resignation.  Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House Counsel of the situation, the White House Counsel briefed the President and a small group of senior advisors.

This would put the briefing to President Trump on the 26th. In the same press briefing, Spicer said "all of the actions and all of the words in this administration are on behalf and at the direction of this President."


Whatever McGahn said to the President, it looks like Trump knew what Yates told the White House:

http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-news-conference-transcript-20170216-story.html
    As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.

    It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said "well I don't see" -- to me, he was doing the job.

    The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said "doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there." But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.

    ...Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.

    He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.


https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/861592420043157504
    Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel.


And Trump has since expressed concern that Flynn could face legal trouble:

https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/847766558520856578
    Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!


This could explain why the President invited the FBI director to an impromptu meeting the day after Yates' warning:

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/did-trump-raise-mike-flynn-s-fbi-troubles-comey-dinner-n759761
     Three days before Trump's dinner with Comey, on January 24, FBI agents came to the White House to interview Flynn about his discussions with Ambassador Kislyak.

    That means Trump would have known about the FBI and Justice Department concerns about Flynn — one of his closest advisers — when he sat down to dinner with Comey.

    ...Former director of national intelligence James Clapper told NBC News' Andrea Mitchell that he was with Comey during the day on the 27th, at an FBI farewell for Clapper.

    "He mentioned that he had been invited to the White House to have dinner with the president, and he was uneasy with that because of… even the appearance of compromising the independence of the FBI," Clapper said.

    But, Clapper added, "Anyone who is a serving office in the government and you are asked by the president to dinner…you are in a difficult position to refuse to go."


Regardless, the testimony of Yates, the statements of the President and his spokesmen, the White House Counsel's calling Yates with concerns about the DOJ pursuing a criminal case against Flynn, and the fact that the FBI interview of Flynn took place on White House grounds all strongly suggest that President Trump learned that Flynn was under investigation shortly before he fired Yates, and that the President was concerned Flynn would face criminal charges.

The circumstances surrounding President Trump's firing of Yates are also suspicious. The President claims he fired Yates for "refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United State," which could only be referring to the travel ban executive order Trump issued a few days earlier.

The problem with this reason are: 1. It was far from clear even then that the executive order was legal (the ban was struck down in court a few weeks later: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/politics/appeals-court-trump-travel-ban.html), and 2. Trump created this very legal quandry that he fired Yates over on January 27th, shortly after learning Flynn was under investigation.

The President's executive order caught most of the country off-guard:

    YATES: No and that was one thing that was of concern to us, is that not only was department leadership not consulted here and beyond department leadership, really the subject matter experts, the national security experts, not only was the department not consulted, we weren't even told about it. I learned about this from media reports.

    KLOBUCHAR: So you learned about it after the meeting at the White house Council from the media.

    YATES: Right.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/donald-trump-rush-immigration-order-chaos.html
    How Trump’s Rush to Enact an Immigration Ban Unleashed Global Chaos


When a reporter brought up the execution of the travel ban, the President offered an excuse for why he rushed his executive order:

http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-news-conference-transcript-20170216-story.html
    QUESTION: On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...

    TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government...

    QUESTION: Were there any mistakes...

    TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait.

    Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.

    We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision.

    ...Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a one-month period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones.

    You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.

    Kelly said you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.

    Now nobody ever reports that. But that's why we did it quickly.

    Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect. The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.


If President Trump's motivation to enact the ban "immediately" was truly for the safety of the United States, one has to wonder why the President didn't sign the order when it was reportedly ready, on January 25th:

    U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign several executive orders on Wednesday restricting immigration from Syria and six other Middle Eastern or African countries, according to several congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the matter.


Trump didn't sign his travel ban until the 27th, after the second meeting between Yates and McGahn. It was during this meeting that McGahn asked about criminal proceedings against Flynn and Yates invited McGahn to view the evidence underlying Flynn's conduct.

After the President's travel ban was hastily implemented on the 27th, it was widely protested for being a thinly-veiled ban on Muslim immigrants:

https://www.democracynow.org/2017/1/26/headlines/thousands_protest_trumps_immigration_crackdown_in_nyc_dc_la


This is a bad look for the President, since making laws that discriminate based on religion is unconstitutional. But instead, the next day, a surrogate of President Trump went on Fox News to say that the President intended for his order to be a Muslim ban:

http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316726-giuliani-trump-asked-me-how-to-do-a-muslim-ban-legally
    Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) said in an interview on Saturday that President Trump had previously asked him about legally implementing a "Muslim ban."

    But Giuliani then disputed the notion that the president's sweeping executive order barring refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim nations amounts to a ban on Muslims.

    "I’ll tell you the whole history of it: When he first announced it, he said ‘Muslim ban,'" Giuliani said on Fox News.

    "He called me up, he said, ‘Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.’"

    Giuliani said he then put together a commission that included lawmakers and expert lawyers.

    "And what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger," Giuliani said.

    "The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible."

    Giuliani reiterated that the ban is "not based on religion."

    "It's based on places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country," he said.


This an unusual move, since, as logic has it, admitting the executive order was intended to be a Muslim ban would only add to the outrage. But this statement by Giuliani did make the executive order hard to legally defend, as Yates said in her January 30th statement:

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/30/us/document-Letter-From-Sally-Yates.html
    ...Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or its surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order's purpose.

    ...I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.

This is bad optics for the President, since it would not have been hard at that time to figure that this move would lead to Sally Yates refusing to defend his executive order, and indeed be pivotal in doing so, as it established an unconstitutional intent or "purpose" behind the order. But Yates' refusing to defend his travel ban was exactly the reason the President gave for firing her--the President created the reason he gave for firing the acting Attorney General, inexplicably, and shortly after learning Flynn was under investigation.

Finally, the President has shown intent to conceal Flynn's misconduct. President Trump said he knew Flynn "didn't tell the vice president properly the facts."

http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-news-conference-transcript-20170216-story.html
    TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.

    He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem.

    ...You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.

    But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.

    ...TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts.


But if the President was as concerned about Flynn lying to Vice President Pence as he suggests, he didn't show it. Pence didn't learn that Flynn lied to him until 15 days after Yates warned the White House:

http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/aide-claims-pattern-keep-vice-president-pence-out-loop-n761916
    Vice President Mike Pence has been kept in the dark about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn's alleged wrongdoing, according to a source close to the administration, who cited a potential "pattern" of not informing the vice president and calling it "malpractice or intentional, and either are unacceptable."

    ...Vice President Mike Pence has been kept in the dark about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn's alleged wrongdoing, according to a source close to the administration, who cited a potential "pattern" of not informing the vice president and calling it "malpractice or intentional, and either are unacceptable."


And the White House was surely made aware that Flynn's conduct was problematic:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/
    YATES: ...And we then walked through with Mr. McGahn essentially why we were telling them about this and the first thing we did was to explain to Mr. McGahn that the underlying conduct that General Flynn had engaged in was problematic in and of itself.

    ...that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Finally, we told them that we were giving them all of this information so that they could take action, the action that they deemed appropriate.


If the President knew Flynn had conducted himself improperly, that he lied to the Vice President, that this lie created a serious situation that the White House should act one immediately, that Flynn was under investigation by the FBI, and that Flynn was in a situation where he "should ask for immunity" (
https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/847766558520856578), why did the President hide this form even his own Vice President? Why did the President tell the public Flynn is a "fine person" who was treated "unfairly," (http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/02/15/trump-netanyahu-joint-presser-flynn-question.cnn) and did nothing wrong?


Additional reports suggest the President intended to keep Flynn's misconduct under wraps:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sought-to-block-sally-yates-from-testifying-to-congress-on-russia/2017/03/28/82b73e18-13b4-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html
    The Trump administration sought to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying in the House investigation of possible links between Russian officials and Donald Trump’s campaign, according to letters provided to The Washington Post.

    ...O’Neil then wrote to White House Counsel Donald McGahn, saying that he believed any privilege had been waived as a result of past White House statements and that Yates planned to testify unless he heard back from McGahn.

    But that same day, the hearing, which also would have included former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., was canceled by the House Intelligence Committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), and any White House decision on Yates’s testimony became moot.

    ...Nunes has said he canceled the hearing to first hear from FBI Director James B. Comey in a classified setting. That session was also canceled.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-asked-intelligence-chiefs-to-push-back-against-fbi-collusion-probe-after-comey-revealed-its-existence/2017/05/22/394933bc-3f10-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html
    In addition to the requests to Coats and Rogers, senior White House officials sounded out top intelligence officials about the possibility of intervening directly with Comey to encourage the FBI to drop its probe of Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, according to people familiar with the matter. The officials said the White House appeared uncertain about its power to influence the FBI.

    “Can we ask him to shut down the investigation? Are you able to assist in this matter?” one official said of the line of questioning from the White House.


There has been a reported intent by the President to shut down the investigation into Flynn and a clear effort by the White House to block Yates from testifying. It's even possible that the President fired the FBI director to distract from Yates' testimony--Yates testified May 8th, and President Trump fired the FBI director the next day. It was the day after that that the President invited Russian officials to the White House, adding to the confusion.

Shortly after learning Flynn was under investigation, the President acted hastily and suspiciously to create an alibi for firing acting Attorney General Yates, fired the acting Attorney General, then acted to conceal Flynn's misconduct from the Vice President and the public. This sequence of events and the circumstances surrounding them strongly suggest that the President likewise fired the acting Attorney General to conceal Flynn's misconduct. If this is true, then the President is guilty of obstruction of justice.

Hello,


Here are the write-ups I've been sending out on the influence operations of Russia's intelligence services.


I've never sent them to a lot of Russian people before, so I'm not sure how people from Russia would react to tem.  It's awkward since I'm pretty sure our countries are in conflict, but it seems to be mostly between our politicians and intelligence services, with Russian and American people kindof shrugging it off and otherwise getting along fine.


For what it's worth I'm a fan of Russian people, but let me tell you your intelligence services are really something else...


The gist of it, or at least a long running theme, is that they rely on influence operations a lot, a sort of "political theater," targeting Russia but also countries around the world. So they will have a lot of agents posing as journalists, for example.


Most of what they do is "divide and conquer" type strategies. So they divide the Republicans and Democrat political parties in my country, divide the Democrats further into the "progressives" and "neo-liberals," try to divide countries like the, U.S. and China, China and Japan, and I think the U.S. and Russia too, but in more nuanced ways. They are good at inventing reasons for different groups of people to get mad at each other and take an "us versus them" mentality.


So they might convince the Russian and Ukrainian people they need to be at war, the Russian and American people, etc., but in the end it's all kindof pointless. I think they go out of their way to hire sociopaths who get their rocks off doing this sort of thing.


Anyway, here are all the notes--sorry they are all in English, I would translate them if I knew Russian:

Hello,

Here are the write-ups on the influence operations of Russia's intelligence services, with plenty of sources.

The gist of it, or at least a running theme, is that they rely on influence operations a lot, a sort of "political theater" targeting the U.S., Russia, and countries around the world. So they will have a lot of agents posing as journalists, "experts," media personalities, politicians, etc.

Most of what they do is "divide and conquer" type strategies. So they divide the Republicans and Democrats, try to divide the Democrats further into the "progressives" and "neo-liberals," try to divide countries like the, U.S. and China, China and Japan, and the U.S. and Russia (in more nuanced ways I think). They are good at inventing reasons for different groups of people to fight with each other and take on an "us versus them" mentality. Supposedly, they go out of their way to hire the type of person who enjoys manipulating other people.

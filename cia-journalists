	A CIA operative told Washington Post owner Philip Graham … in a conversation about the willingness of journalists to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories:

		You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month.


	...In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America’s leading news organizations.



http://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-cia-paid-and-threatened-journalists-to-do-its-work
	The CIA has long played the international game of propaganda required by an intelligence agency, but during the Cold War, the Agency paid and intimidated journalists into helping promote its messages. Famous Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein broke the story in 1977 for Rolling Stone. Bernstein revealed the workings of Operation Mockingbird, in which many journalists – included Pulitzer Prize winners – joined the CIA’s payroll, writing fake stories to disseminate the agency’s agitprop and providing intelligence. Other journalists were threatened and blackmailed into cooperating with Mockingbird, and many were given falsified or fabricated information about their actions in order to engender their support for the CIA’s mission. The program has never been officially discontinued.


that's the entire article? weird...

	“I’m going to stand up and say it is not right what I have done in the past, to manipulate people, to make propaganda against Russia and it is not right what my colleagues do and have done in the past, because they are bribed, to betray the people not only in Germany all over Europe.”

	Ulfkotte

	Udo Ulfkotte, a German journalist and whistleblower who spoke out against fake news from government and intelligence sources, has died from a heart attack at the age of 56. He was an assistant editor for German mainstream media newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and he lived in many Middle Eastern countries during his career, including Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan.

	As Ulfkotte became increasingly upset at news reports sourced from false government information, he began publishing a magazine called Whistleblower, which reports on topics not covered by the German media. He also wrote multiple books on the subject during the 2000s.

	Ulfkotte is best known to international viewers from select appearances on Russia Today, specifically an October 2014 interview about his book ‘Bought Journalists’, in which he discussed the epidemic of propaganda in mainstream media news reports and the increased anti-Russia sentiment being generated. He also discussed the heavy influence on international news from American, Israeli and other western intelligence agencies.

	...His comments were one of the earlier warnings about anti-Russia propaganda which came before the recent escalation which features American media claiming Russian officials influenced the 2016 US election in favor of Donald Trump.

Reddit AMA on "CIA manipulation of the MSM," was pinned to front page of r/politics iirc

	Mainstream media is kind of an annoying construct, as is alternative and/or new media. My book focuses both on what we would traditionally refer to as the elite media: the NYTimes, WashPost, etc, as well as newer sources of investigative material, such as Wikileaks, Vice, and the Intercept. Some reporters at elite newspapers, like James Risen of the NYT, have done a great job challenging the CIA, White House, and their own editors, but often are shut down on important stories. There is an unspoken rule that all such media outlets provide the CIA/White House etc, with at least a 24 hours heads up about any story they are about to publish, but this is starting to wane in practice. The CIA, when I visited their public affairs office last year, complained bitterly about their inability to prevent stories from reaching wide audiences via the internet once they are posted somewhere, and specifically complained about the Intercept refusing to play by the traditional rules.



https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57hot4/hi_reddit_im_nicholas_schou_author_of_spooked_a/d8s7gx9/
	I think the CIA revels in the nefarious depiction it sees in over-the-top movies like the Bourne series. The agency doesn't care how it is perceived in fiction or in print, as long as reinforces the idea in people's minds that we would be worse off without it. I am less concerned with abolishing the agency than with focusing the minds of the American public on the massive expansion of secrecy and the public-private partnership that continues to gobble up our tax revenue in the name of national security and the war on terror. As Jonathan Kwitny best argued in his book Endless Enemies, the problem goes to the very foundation of our state: it is built on war and creates conflicts where there would be none.


"CIA not worth the money" sounds familiar...


https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57hot4/hi_reddit_im_nicholas_schou_author_of_spooked_a/d8s3hb2/
	I find it less difficult to generalize about individual reporters than the outlets where they work. At the NYT, James Risen, Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman are very dogged and willing to lose sources or fight editors to get important stories into print. But the NYT as an institution completely failed to do its job in publishing the Judith Miller stories on Iraqi WMDs. Same goes for the Washington Post. That newspaper is uniquely embedded in the U.S. national security state, and while it gets a lot of great scoops, it has also allowed itself to consistently act as a tool of Langley et al. The Intercept is starting to live up to its potential as a source of aggressive reporting, and Jason Leopold at Vice News is a one-man factory of great public records-based reporting, so much so that the FBI dubbed him the "FOIA Terrorist."

WaPo is CIA propaganda

	To repeat: It has been illegal for the CIA to directly employ domestic journalists ever since the 1970s. Even assuming the CIA was willing to break the law, it would be a ridiculous thing for the agency to do given the fact that, AS MY BOOK WHICH YOU SHOULD READ DEMONSTRATES, the CIA doesn't need to pay reporters, because reporters do the agency's bidding simply to promote their own careers.


hmmmm


https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57hot4/hi_reddit_im_nicholas_schou_author_of_spooked_a/d8s4l96/
	Sure. First of all, the big change in this nexus was Watergate and the Family Jewels scandal, which placed the CIA under congressional oversight and prohibited it from carrying out domestic spying operations or putting journalists on its payroll. But the brief window of aggressive investigative reporting during that era was quickly closed during the 1980s, with the rise of Reaganomics. Journalists have been under attack ever since then, with mounting financial pressure and the gradual corporate monopolization of the press. By the 1990s, the CIA had already effectively rehabilitated its image in the press (with the Gary Webb saga being one brief interruption) and this coincides with when the agency made overtures to work closely with Hollywood, seeing a new opportunity to burnish its image there--a decision that paid off handsomely for the agency.


interesting way of putting it

talking about family jewels saga

	What do you think they might be doing as far as the current election cycle is concerned?

	Edit: Don't look now, but there is a spider just behind you.


	...The CIA and White House are extremely upset about the possibility that the Russian government (possibly in cahoots with Wikileaks) is trying to manipulate the outcome of the U.S. elections. This has led to very prominently placed articles in the Washington Post and other elite news media outlets alleging that this is happening, although no clear link to the Kremlin has been cited. While it may be true, the American public is simply being told to believe this via newspaper articles that fail to quote even a single intelligence source speaking on the record about it, which is suspicious.


Russia is fake news!

	The CIA has worked behind the scenes with its allies in the news media to debunk any so-called conspiracy theories that challenge the agency's sense of purpose. It colluded with the press to control inquiries into JFK's assassination, hiding crucial information from congress and the public, and helped build a public relations campaign that tended to discredit legitimate research into what the CIA knew beforehand. This isn't to say the CIA whacked JFK per se, but rather that the agency knew that a fair inquiry into the matter would be very embarrassing to the agency, given its ties to obvious suspects, etc. This set the template for all future independent inquiries into CIA misconduct that lacked adequate political support: deny everything and wait for the frustrated, ill-equipped media to stop researching and turn on each other, etc...


Talking about Church committee, that kind of thing?

	I had included information about this that was edited out of the book for space reasons but also because it's already been reported. Bradlee himself talks all about Angleton and his bizarre behavior after the death of Mary Pinchot Meyer in his memoir. Rumors have always abounded about Bradlee's ties to the agency. I was told by a former Wash Post writer that Bradlee was terrified at the thought that the CIA would be able to recruit a spy inside the paper. I found this idea very ironic because that would be the worst use of agency funds imaginable--they already own the paper. Just read Veil, by Bob Woodward, in which CIA director Bill Casey told the Post that they were running a war in Central America without congressional approval, and Bradlee told Woodward to just sit on the info, which he did.


Angle and bizzare behavior.. reminds me of Hersh?


https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57hot4/hi_reddit_im_nicholas_schou_author_of_spooked_a/d8s6irw/
	Nobody's asked about it yet, but another huge story Langley effectively planted in the media and Hollywood is the official story about how we supposedly found Osama bin Laden hiding out in Abbottabad. Seymour Hersh poked major holes in that story--which would definitely have come out differently if our helicopter hadn't crashed at the scene--and his major allegation that a Pakistani intelligence source told us bin Laden's whereabouts has yet to be debunked.

a fan of Hersh?

	Are the Russians Really Using Cyber Tricks to Undermine US Democracy?
Or is the Washington Post Playing Ventriloquists’ Dummy for the CIA

	Old Allies Fighting the New Cold War
	.

	On Sept. 5, The Washington Post published a front page story asserting that the Russian government is seeking to undermine American democracy at a crucial time, using unspecified “cybertools” to spread disinformation and chaos that could alter the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election.

	“US intelligence and law enforcement agencies are investigating what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States to sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in US political institutions,” the Post reported.

	The paper’s source for this information? Anonymous “intelligence and congressional officials.” Not until the fifth paragraph of the story, which ran under the alarming headline, “US investigating potential covert Russian plan to disrupt November elections,” did the newspaper acknowledge that its stable of off-the-record sources had no “definitive proof” whatsoever of any Russian plot.

	Then, having issued the obligatory, if somewhat buried, disclaimer, the story went on to highlight the supposed threat posed by Russian hackers working for the Kremlin to the very foundation of American democracy.

	...This is hardly the first time the Post has allowed itself to serve as an unpaid asset of the CIA by running a story full of blind quotes highlighting some perceived national security threat. In fact, ever since the start of the Cold War, the newspaper has proved itself to be the most reliable media organ of the US national security state.

	The newspaper’s role in helping to build the illegitimate case for invading Iraq based on leaked reports of false evidence that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction is perhaps the most famous example. However countless other examples exist, and they include editorial crimes of both commission and omission.

	...But as revealed by the recent hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the only actual case of election-related hacking allegedly tied to the Kremlin, the endgame of that particular operation wasn’t to sabotage an election. In fact, the motive seems to have been exactly the opposite — to expose the fact that the DNC had sabotaged the party nomination campaign of Bernie Sanders.

	Sadly, we don’t need the Russians to undermine American democracy, because that mission has already been accomplished from within.

	Washington Post-CIA Connections Destroy Post’s “election hack” Claim
	Who exactly is the fake news outlet?

	...You might remember the Washington Post’s role in defaming and destroying Gary Webb, who, in 1996, published a series of articles in the Mercury News about the CIA seeding black Los Angeles neighborhoods with crack cocaine. The Post basically asked the CIA whether the charge was true, and when the Agency denied it, the Post attacked Webb as a “fake news” reporter. The same Washington Post is now leading the campaign to tie the Russian government to Hillary Clinton’s defeat. And the Post, once again, is using unproven statements from the CIA to back up their claim.

	I could go on and on about the Post and its historic CIA ties. But now, right now, the owner of the Post is Jeff Bezos, who also owns Amazon. And Amazon has a $600 million contract to provide the CIA cloud computing services (more here and here).

	Boom.

	According to an unsubstantiated article by the Washington Post, anonymous CIA officials have confirmed that the Russian government hacked the United States election to favor Donald Trump. Though it’s entirely possible the Russian government attempted to influence the election, the Post has been widely criticized — for the second time in a month — for its failure to follow basic journalistic practices. Nevertheless, the narrative is sticking.

	But the outlet’s behind-the-scenes relationship with the CIA is nothing new.

	In the past six weeks, the Washington Post published two blockbuster stories about the Russian threat that went viral: one on how Russia is behind a massive explosion of “fake news,” the other on how it invaded the U.S. electric grid. Both articles were fundamentally false. Each now bears a humiliating editor’s note grudgingly acknowledging that the core claims of the story were fiction: The first note was posted a full two weeks later to the top of the original article; the other was buried the following day at the bottom.

	The Washington Post on Thursday night promoted the claims of a new, shadowy organization that smears dozens of U.S. news sites that are critical of U.S. foreign policy as being “routine peddlers of Russian propaganda.” The article by reporter Craig Timberg — headlined “Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election, experts say” — cites a report by an anonymous website calling itself PropOrNot, which claims that millions of Americans have been deceived this year in a massive Russian “misinformation campaign.”

Reporter Thomas Frank, who wrote the article, assistant managing editor Eric Lichtblau, and executive editor for investigations Lex Haris all left the outlet following the story’s retraction. The story, published last week, linked Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci to the Russia investigation, citing a single anonymous source. Politico’s Hadas Gold reported that Scaramucci threatened CNN with legal action over the story. After the story’s retraction, CNN implemented new guidelines on its Russia coverage.

    “Russia is a full-scope cyber actor that will remain a major threat to US Government, military, diplomatic, commercial, and critical infrastructure,” the assessment reads. “Moscow has a highly advanced offensive cyber program, and in recent years, the Kremlin has assumed a more aggressive cyber posture. This aggressiveness was evident in Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election, and we assess that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized the 2016 U.S. election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets.”


I don't know how to reach him, but I think Coats is missing the mark here. Historically, the greatest threat from them has been their influence operations--their influence operations alone killed tens of millions of Chinese in the Great Chinese Famine--and it looks like that hasn't changed. Here are some notes on their operations:

They might have used influence operations to start and prolong the Iraq and Vietnam wars too:

So cyber attacks are one threat, but I think Coats might be misunderstanding the kind of threat the U.S. and the world faces from these people.

And there might be an underlying misreading of how they think here too. The U.S. could treat cyber-warfare as another "theater" of war and respond to attacks in-kind, but I don't the U.S. should or would want to respond with attacks to civilians and nor do I think the Russian government would care. Before the Chinese Famine, they forced "Lysenkoism" agricultural pseudoscience on the Russian people as well. And Stalin deliberately allowed, if not encouraged, operation Barbarossa to kill millions of Soviet citizens.

From what I can tell, their whole ideology is based on selfishness or "self-interest." You might be able to mitigate them, but the U.S. will probably never be able to prevent cyberattacks or biological attacks that cripple our infrastructure and kill millions of people using technology and "defense" alone. It's far easier to destroy than to create or preserve. You have to rely on deterrence; specifically, creating an understanding that such attacks will result in personal consequences for their leadership.

    In one breath, President Donald Trump’s new director of national intelligence told lawmakers that threats to the United States are growing in size and complexity — and in the next, that he is looking for cuts across the entire U.S. intelligence community.

    Director Dan Coats told a Senate panel Thursday that he is looking to “streamline” the 17 federal agencies that comprise the IC.

    “As part of the administration’s goal of an effective and efficient government, we have already begun a review of the entire intelligence community, to include the office of the DNI,” Coats testified to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
     In any other year, declaring one’s intention to hunt for taxpayer savings would be a stock statement by an agency head telling Congress what members always like to hear. But Coats spoke two days after Trump fired James Comey over what many senators believe was the FBI director’s investigation of potential links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

    President Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey is “another victory on the scoreboard” for a Russian government that has put the institutions of the U.S. government “under assault,” former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Sunday.

    ...“In many ways, our institutions are under assault, both externally — and that's the big news here, is the Russian interference in our election system. And I think as well our institutions are under assault internally,” Clapper said.

    “Internally from the president?” CNN anchor Jake Tapper followed up.

    “Exactly,” Clapper replied. “The Founding Fathers, in their genius, created a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances. And I feel as though that's under assault and is eroding.”

Coats, Pompeo, Kelly, and others should make sure this effort to "streamline" the USIC isn't part of influence operation to curtail the USIC's ability to fight back. The KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn suggested something like this has happened before:

    Pursuit of a realistic foreign policy by the United States has been made even more difficult by the demoralization of their intelligence and counterintelligence services that followed the Watergate exposures and the overblown campaign to restrict the functions of the CIA and FBI. The CIA's capacity for political action was curtailed and two thousand experienced officers were retired. Particular damage was done to US counterintelligence, whose task it should be to analyze communist policy and tactics, forecast communist intentions, and so help to protect the nation and its intelligence services from communist penetration, subversion, agents of influence, and disinformation.


It is critical for our national security to ensure we have robust intelligence services, and that USIC and Congressional leadership understands the kind of threat we face. The Okhrana was able to essentially destroy the country of China and kill millions of their people due to an intelligence advantage alone.

We are in the middle of a major foreign attack on our country, the likes of which we haven't seen before. Russia is using psychological warfare to deceive and divide our citizens, and espionage, blackmail, and bribery to take control of our government. They have allies in Congress, industry, and the media.

Russian leadership has a long-lived and deep-seated hatred of the United States. It is believed the purpose of their coup is to augment their psychological warfare to accelerate the destruction of American society.

Our foreign allies can help us, but pretty soon their governments will be taken over by the Russians too. We have to act quickly. Americans must take back control of our government.

Their coup won't work if Americans don't accept it. Don't give in. Don't give up.

It looks like Russia has a history of manipulating its pawns and enemies into violent conflict with each other, in line with their philosophy of "turning a stronger force against itself:"

With that in mind, it's interesting to see how the attitude toward certain countries in Russia's propaganda changes over time.

Around the height of tensions between the U.S. and Iran surrounding their nuclear program, InfoWars took a pretty strong stance against war with Iran:

https://www.infowars.com/media-blackout-on-cheney-iran-false-flag-story/

https://www.infowars.com/most-americans-and-europeans-support-impending-attack-on-iran/


But toward the end of the Obama presidency and into the Trump presidency, they take an increasingly negative stance on Iran, with less anti-war and more scaremongering and chest-thumping in their Iran coverage:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site:infowars.com+Iran&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/2016

https://www.infowars.com/is-iran-funding-terrorism-in-latin-america/

https://www.infowars.com/iranian-military-leader-threatens-president-elect-trump/


It's similar for other outlets. Breitbart barely covered Iran during the nuclear crisis under Obama:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abreitbart.com+Iran&tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1/1/2011

http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2010/06/22/review-in-hbos-for-neda-the-symbol-of-irans-green-revolution-comes-to-vivid-life/

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2010/10/31/cyber-warfare-and-the-future-of-post-castro-cuba/


But before and during Trump, they started pumping out articles about Iran funding terrorists or challenging the U.S.:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abreitbart.com+Iran&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/2016

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/03/30/top-us-commander-irans-heightened-threat-since-nuclear-deal-may-require-military-response/

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/02/15/exclusive-iran-harassed-us-ships-three-times-year/


There's a similar pattern with Zerohedge, which is more anti-war. During the Iran crisis under Obama, they barely covered Iran besides a few conspiracy theories that the "deep state bankers" are in cahoots with Iran (or something like that):

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Azerohedge.com+Iran&tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1/1/2011

http://www.zerohedge.com/article/inside-global-banking-intelligence-complex-bcci-operations

http://www.zerohedge.com/article/guest-post-irans-option-case-attack-its-nuclear-facilities


But under Trump, they have more than a few articles about Iran going rouge or being a threat, although they still occasionally put out articles against war with Iran (albeit while claiming war is inevitable):

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Azerohedge.com+Iran&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/2016

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-03/coming-clash-iran



Iran isn't the only country where you can see this pattern. Brietbart's coverage of North Korea around their 2013 nuclear tests was sparse, and included a lot more light-hearted articles:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abreitbart.com+North+Korea&tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1/1/2014

http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2013/04/16/hawaii-five-0-north-korea/

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2013/04/13/female-north-korean-soldiers-march-in-high-heels/

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2013/08/21/north-korean-ruler-having-trouble-finding-virgins-to-dance-for-him/


But into the Trump administration, their coverage increased in volume, especially the chest-thumping and scare-mongering kind:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abreitbart.com+North+Korea&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/2016

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/03/20/north-korea-tillerson-ready-any-war/

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/03/29/north-korea-we-are-ready-for-pre-emptive-nuclear-strike-on-u-s/


And it's the same again for InfoWars and other outlets. During the 2013 nuclear tests they treat North Korea like a curiosity or a distraction:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ainfowars.com+North+Korea&tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1/1/2014

But up to and during Trump's presidency they treat North Korea as a threat:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ainfowars.com+North+Korea&tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:1/1/2016


And you can also generally see Russian propaganda scaremongering about ISIS obtaining WMDs:

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ainfowars.com+ISIS+biological+OR+nuclear+OR+dirty+OR+radioactive+weapons&tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1/1/2016

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abreitbart.com+ISIS+biological+OR+nuclear+OR+dirty+OR+radioactive+weapons&tbs=cdr:1,cd_max:1/1/2016


I think this is part of a general strategy by Russia to lure the U.S. into prolonged or expensive wars, like Vietnam or Iraq. The CIA has suspected the Russians of trying this kind of thing before:

http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB428/
    Instead, the SNIE postulated that reported "Soviet fears of impending war" could be a ploy to lure the United States into a smaller scale confrontation (perhaps in the Middle East) which the Soviets would exploit for larger geostrategic gain."

And, true to form, Russia accuses us of doing the same in their propaganda:

https://www.rt.com/news/afghanistan-the-us-made-soviet-trap/

http://www.pravdareport.com/world/asia/16-02-2009/107105-usa_ussr_afghanistan-0/


What's interesting is the question of China's involvement. It looks like China helped North Korea build their missiles:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kim-jong-uns-rockets-are-getting-an-important-boost--from-china/2017/04/12/4893b0be-1a43-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html
    When confronted privately about such exports, Chinese officials have typically demanded high levels of proof — specific names and dates that can be difficult to derive from water-damaged rocket parts pulled from the ocean, said an Obama administration nonproliferation official involved in sensitive negotiations with China over its relations with North Korea.

     “They’d say, ‘give us details,’ but in most cases we could never say it was ‘this precise person on this precise day,’” said the official, who insisted on anonymity in describing diplomatic negotiations. “With them, it was never a team sport. It was always just the bare minimum of what they had to do in order to avoid having to take serious action.”

And their attitude about it makes it sound like they wanted North Korea to have long range ballistic missiles.

Similarly, it looks like Russia is helping Syria obtain chemical weapons:

http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/politics/us-intelligence-syrian-chemical-weapons/
    The US now assesses that Syria has re-established a unit of personnel associated with chemical weapons that existed before the 2013 agreement in which the Syrian government pledged to give up its weapons inventory. And there is some indication they are getting outside help.

    "We know they have the expertise. And we suspect that they have help," a US military official told reporters at a background briefing Friday.

while Trump's "advisors" pitch theories that Iran was behind the attack:

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/donald-trump-bashar-assad-syria-chemical-weapons-237083
    In White House meetings, evening calls with friends and even throughout the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump asked a repeated question: Why did Syria’s president use nerve gas? Trump puzzled over the mystery —even as he ordered 59 Tomahawk missiles careening into a Syrian airfield last Thursday night.

    Trump isn’t alone. U.S. officials and Syria experts are still debating what Syrian President Bashar Assad was thinking when he ordered a chemical attack sure to spark international outrage. Maybe Assad was hoping to terrorize his opponents. Perhaps he was testing Trump’s limits for his military planning. Trump officials even initially considered the possibility that Assad had not ordered the strike at all, according to one administration official, and that a military commander might have gone rogue without Assad’s knowledge.

    …Trump is hardly the only one wondering about Assad's motive. “It’s a good question,” said Paul Salem, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute. “Nobody really knows.”

    While many Syria experts in Washington endorse the official consensus that Assad is desperate to fend off even a weakened rebel opposition, they are still entertaining other theories.

    Some are complex and probably far-fetched. They include the possibility of a rogue military commander — perhaps loyal to Iran, which has sent troops and funding to prop up Assad — was trying to sabotage the possibility of a U.S.-Russia-Assad alliance that could isolate Tehran.

Both Russian and China could (correctly I think) figure: if false intelligence about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq could draw the U.S. into a costly war, actual weapons of mass destruction in the hands of North Korea, Syria, or ISIS would be more than enough to do the same.

This raises questions about how far Russian and China are cooperating to undermine the U.S., which was a question during the Cold War as well. Angleton thought Kissinger was a Russian spy, and he looks even more like one today:

https://pastebin.com/zjHbRS7C

In addition to promoting appeasement with the Soviets and helping prolong the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Kissinger also jump-started China's economy with his "opening to China:"

http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB66/

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-gardels/kissinger-its-time-for-ch_b_886638.html

Angleton thought the "Sino-Soviet split" at the time was a fake-out. Interestingly, the semi-famous journalist Seymore Hersh ridiculed Angleton for this:

http://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/25/archives/the-angleton-story-from-forced-retirement-james-jesus-angleton.html
    He still clings to the view, which he advocated forcefully within the C.I.A., that the Sino‐Soviet formation operation concocted by the K.G.B. After Henry Kissinger made his dramatic 1971 trip to Peking to restore relations with China, Angleton, according to one acquaintance, expressed suspicions about “whether the K.G.B. had its arm on Kissinger.”

    ...One former official, who served as an aide to Richard Helms when Helms was director, recalled that Angleton would occasionally give his views of the Sino‐Soviet split at staff meetings, “and everybody would just look at one another and shrug

But Hersh sounds like another Russian propagandist, even today:

https://pastebin.com/zjHbRS7C

https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-04-07/who-trusts-russian-spies-on-syria

(some other well-known journalists have turned out to be Russian agents, like I.F. Stone)


Today, there are still indications of cooperation between China and Russia, even though Russian propaganda today generally looks like it tries to provoke distrust or fear of China. For example, Russia had a large propaganda campaign against the TPP, but killing the TPP helps China more than Russia. And Duterte fits the mold of the Russian stooges being installed throughout Europe:

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-idUSKBN14528Q

https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aphilstar.com+Putin

But the Philippine's split from the U.S. also helps China more than Russia.


The U.S. is a stronger power than either China or Russia alone, so they could reasonably be expected to see teaming up against the U.S. as in their interests. As with Russia, there is evidence of Chinese infiltration of our Government too:

Whether Russia and China are cooperating or not, there is still the question why Russia's propaganda didn't trying to foment conflict with Iran or North Korea until Trump's presidency. After 2013 it became clear that Obama's foreign policy was timid, and Russia might have figured luring Obama into a war would be difficult. But fomenting public fear and distrust of Iran or North Korea under Obama wouldn't have hurt their efforts under the next president.

So it looks like they see Trump as especially suited for luring the U.S. into a costly war (or wars). Trump is even dumber than Bush, and his most trusted advisors are even more suspicious than Bush's advisors. If Bush could get suckered into Iraq, one would expect they could get Trump to do even worse. A proxy war with China would be particularly costly, since China could send in a lot more "volunteers" than Russia could:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Volunteer_Army

and Trump might be too dumb to realize it (assuming he wasn't just trying to cover for Putin here):

http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/31/politics/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-crimea-putin/
    Trump says Putin is 'not going to go into Ukraine,' despite Crimea

http://euromaidanpress.com/2016/03/16/little-green-men-returned-back-to-russia-in-prague/

This might also explain in part why the Russians held off on trying to foment conflict with North Korea or Iran, and why China and Russia ignored Obama's "diplomatic efforts" to stop Syria and North Korea from obtaining WMDs. If both knew the U.S. Government has a problem with infiltration from Russian and Chinese spies, and both knew Russian propaganda outlets like InfoWars, Breitbart, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, and others were gaining a foothold in U.S. media, they could predict that the U.S. was about to get "regime changed," and any consequences for their actions would be short-lived.

I think I get one way how they use divide and conquer, why they always cause divisions and influence both sides.

Part of human nature is to form groups and fight.

But in a fight, people lose sight of things they wouldn't otherwise--decency, ideals, sometimes even food, sleep, family. They become focused on beating "the other side" and forget everything else.

By putting people into a fight, they help reduce people to their base instincts, making them easier to control. The more bitter the fight, the more of people's humanity it strips away.

	There is a Latin tag cui prodest? meaning “who stands to gain?” When it is not immediately apparent which political or social groups, forces or alignments advocate certain proposals, measures, etc., one should always ask: “Who stands to gain?” 


I think there was another quote where Lenin projects says the only way to figure out someone's motive and goals is to watch what they do and project the effects. Maybe he was thining of "maskirova" when he said this.


The problem is if you look at the activities of Russia's special servies as a whole, nobody on earth stands to gain...

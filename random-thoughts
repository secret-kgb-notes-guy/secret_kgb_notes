I think I get one way how they use divide and conquer, why they always cause divisions and influence both sides.

Part of human nature is to form groups and fight.

But in a fight, people lose sight of things they wouldn't otherwise--decency, ideals, sometimes even food, sleep, family. They become focused on beating "the other side" and forget everything else.

By putting people into a fight, they help reduce people to their base instincts, making them easier to control. The more bitter the fight, the more of people's humanity it strips away.

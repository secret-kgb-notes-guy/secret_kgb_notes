Heritage has been closely involved with Trump's transition team:

	They make an unlikely pair: an uncompromising conservative giant of the tea party movement and the one-time Democrat who wrote “The Art of the Deal.”

	But former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint has forged a relationship with President Donald Trump and his administration anyway, and as the new presidency gets underway, he enjoys a position as one of the most influential conservatives in Trump’s Washington.

	...The list of powerful Heritage veterans now at the White House includes Winfree, who held several prominent posts at the Heritage Foundation, and Rick Dearborn, now the White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her family, Republican mega-donors from Michigan, have also long been close to the organization.

	A year ago, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation dismissed Donald Trump as a big-government enthusiast and left-wing sympathizer.

	Now, the Heritage Foundation has emerged as one of the most influential forces shaping President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team, embedding the veteran Washington group into the operation of a candidate who ran loudly against the Beltway.

	Part gatekeeper, part brain trust and part boots on the ground, Heritage is both a major presence on the transition team itself and a crucial conduit between Trump’s orbit and the once-skeptical conservative leaders who ultimately helped get him elected.

	Heritage is “absolutely the fulcrum, and essential to staffing the administration with people who reflect Trump’s commitments across the board,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of Susan B. Anthony List, a prominent group that opposes abortion rights. “I can say it’s been a source of great confidence during the election to know that principled people were planning for a Trump administration.”


But Russian intelligence has been interested in the people and institutions that make U.S. policy, as well as those of other countries:

	There is an attempt to co-opt parts of the expert community in the West via such bodies as the Valdai Forum, which critics accuse of swapping access for acquiescence. Other senior Western experts are given positions in Russian companies and become de facto communications representatives of the Kremlin.

	They were both business partners in TechCast, a think tank that tries to predict the shape of tomorrow's technologies, and had also been members of a board at the Lifeboat Foundation, a non-profit organisation that encourages scientific advancements.

	Rafael Ramirez, of the Oxford Futures Forum in the UK, has told the BBC he was in regular professional contact with Mr Heathfield over internet security and strategy programmes.

	"He came across as an American entrepreneur, quite an aggressive American entrepreneur, trying to work internationally," Mr Ramirez said.

	"I'm either very, very bad at second-guessing who is a Russian spy or he hid it very well."

	“Volexity observed five different attack waves with a heavy focus on U.S.-based think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs),” the company wrote. “These e-mails came from a mix of attacker created Google Gmail accounts and what appears to be compromised e-mail accounts at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). These e-mails were sent in large quantities to different individuals across many organizations and individuals focusing in national security, defense, international affairs, public policy, and European and Asian studies. Two of the attacks purported to be messages forwarded on from the Clinton Foundation giving insight and perhaps a postmortem analysis into the elections.”

    The Soviets pumped huge amounts of cash to influence Indian politicians, including a large number of Congress MPs during former prime minister Indira Gandhi's government, to influence Indian policies, according to a now declassified December 1985 CIA report.

    The agents, whom the U.S. sent to Russia in July 2010 in the largest spy swap since the Cold War, are not accused of stealing any U.S. secrets. But they were more dangerous than commonly believed, C. Frank Figliuzzi, FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said in an interview.

    They were "the cream of the crop" of trained Russian intelligence agents, he said, and they were sent here to blend in and befriend American policymakers. They were succeeding, Figliuzzi said.


Like other think tanks, Heritage might have a Russian spy problem. Although they sometimes advise the U.S. to be tough on Russia:

http://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/how-the-next-president-should-deal-russia


(although it's interesting they stop short of reccomending more sanctions on Russian oil companies)


other times they have advocated for bad policies, like helping grow Russia's energy sector:

Or advising against intervention in Syria (but without outright saying it):

Heritage President Jim DeMint has also aggravated lawmakers with his efforts to influence Congress to be more partisan:

He also promotes bad ideas or helps promote people with bad ideas:

Whether he knows it or not, DeMint is helping the Russians make U.S. politics more ideologically divided and dysfunctional.

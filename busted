    Nunes described the surveillance as most likely being “incidental collection.” This can occur when a person inside the United States communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be kept secret — but can be “unmasked” by intelligence officials under certain circumstances.

    Nunes said his new information appears to show that additional members of the Trump transition team — beyond former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn — were unmasked. This means they were identified in U.S. intelligence reports.

    He said the information that he had seen and was disseminated across the intelligence community appeared to him to have "little or no apparent intelligence value."


Nunes claims the intelligence has "little or no apparent intelligence value," but he looked awfully nervous a few days ago when he said he was worried about incidental collection catching members of Congress.

Nunes says members of the Trump transition team were caught in incidental collection, but many members of Trump's transition team were members of Congress, including Nunes.

Data from incidental collections can be used to start an investigation:

    Indeed, it has recently come to light that FBI agents can trawl these databases to initiate investigations in addition to looking for foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime, further undercutting the argument that Section 702 is solely a foreign-oriented scheme rather than an avenue for conducting warrantless domestic security surveillance.


And the investigation into Trump's associates has reportedly uncovered evidence of collusion:

    The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign, US officials told CNN.

    The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee is claiming that he has been presented with new information on collusion between associates of President Donald Trump and Russia that would merit a grand jury investigation.

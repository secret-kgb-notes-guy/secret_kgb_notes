Hello,

It appears that Russia has taken over the Federal Government of the United States:

Furthermore, Russia is poised to install puppets throughout Europe in the coming months, using similar tactics of vote tampering, propaganda, blackmail, and releasing compromising information.

To call this a disaster would be an understatement. The United States needs to take a strong stance against Russia to deter Putin from essentially taking over the entire Western world. But President Trump has shown he is more interested in appeasing Putin:

Although there have been allegations that Trump is being blackmailed by the Kremlin, there is evidence that Trump's motivations are ideological:

Trump has long had strange ideas and warm feelings for Russia. He seems to think that other countries are exploiting us, and that Russia and the U.S. must join forces and pool their nuclear armaments to prevent a global nuclear proliferation catastrophe.

It looks like we won't be able to convince Trump to prevent Russia from taking over the Western World. With time running out, we have limited options. And since Trump is historically unpopular, and Russia all but certainly tampered with votes in our 2016 elections, there is a chance the U.S. could see increasingly massive protests or revolution.

One way for America to revolt against the Federal Government peacefully and swiftly is by succession of states, which might be viable under a Trump administration. For example, "California Yes" is a movement that has gained some recent popularity, although it is a Kremlin operation designed to divide the United States:

Things are different if multiple states succeed. If enough powerful states succeed from the Union, it could build momentum for the rest to follow. Then the states could create a new federal government that is not controlled by Russia, and hold a new election with better protections of our electoral systems.

Even though the states would not have control of Federal armed forces during this time, there's a good chance they would have enough military power to deter Russia anyway. The national guard reserve cyber forces have greatly out-performed Federal cyber forces, for example:

Although this plan is unusual, I hope state governors consider it seriously and lay the groundwork for such a plan to be executed if necessary. This is an unprecedented situation, and the United States should be prepared to respond by any means necessary. When the U.S. installed Yeltsin in Russia, it devastated their country, and we should expect Russia's efforts will likewise harm our country and our allies if they go unchecked:

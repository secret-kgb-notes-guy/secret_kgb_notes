Angleton's views on Russian intelligence are interesting. In 1978, he suspected Henry Kissnger was working for them:

http://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/25/archives/the-angleton-story-from-forced-retirement-james-jesus-angleton.html
    Angleton, according to one acquaintance, expressed suspicions about “whether the K.G.B. had its arm on Kissinger.”


It looks like he was on to something:

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-kissinger-russia-putin-232925
    When Barack Obama took over the presidency from Bush, he sought Kissinger’s help on how to deal with Putin. A 2009 meeting between Kissinger and Putin helped lay the groundwork for a new arms-control pact as part of Obama’s effort to “reset” Russian relations. Kissinger remained involved in arms negotiations through 2010, according to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails released by the State Department.

https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-31/inside-obamas-secret-outreach-to-russia
    President Barack Obama's administration has been working behind the scenes for months to forge a new working relationship with Russia, despite the fact that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown little interest in repairing relations with Washington or halting his aggression in neighboring Ukraine.

    ...In a separate attempt at outreach, the White House turned to an old friend of Putin’s for help. The White House called on former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to discuss having him call Putin directly, according to two officials. It’s unclear whether Kissinger actually made the call. The White House and Kissinger both refused to comment for this column.

(The reset didn't go so well. I thought Kissinger was supposed to be good?)

    By Henry A. Kissinger

    Far too often the Ukrainian issue is posed as a showdown: whether Ukraine joins the East or the West. But if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side’s outpost against the other — it should function as a bridge between them.

    ...The West must understand that, to Russia, Ukraine can never be just a foreign country.

    ...subordination of the strategic element to domestic politics in negotiating Ukraine’s relationship to Europe contributed to turning a negotiation into a crisis.

    ...Ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations, including with Europe.

    At the same time, it is already clear that in two eastern provinces, where 14 percent of the electorate lives, balloting will be next to impossible, thanks to forcible disruption by Russian-backed militants. The United States and its European allies have said they will impose additional sanctions on Russia if it disrupts the election or fails “to use its influence to prevent those efforts,” as White House spokesman Jay Carney put it last week. Six days before the election, that failure is blatantly evident.

    “There is intimidation,” a senior U.N. official told the Reuters news agency in describing the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ivan Simonovic, the assistant U.N. secretary general for human rights, said that a number of presidents and vice presidents of local elections commissions had been abducted or otherwise mistreated. Reuters reported that the last election commission attempting to operate in the city of Donetsk shut down Monday, leaving no voting operation in an urban area of 1 million people. Concluded the interior minister of Ukraine’s interim government: “It will be impossible to hold normal elections over the huge territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.”

    Washington, D.C., September 11, 2013 – Henry Kissinger urged President Richard Nixon to overthrow the democratically elected Allende government in Chile because his "'model' effect can be insidious," according to documents posted today by the National Security Archive. The coup against Allende occurred on this date 40 years ago. The posted records spotlight Kissinger's role as the principal policy architect of U.S. efforts to oust the Chilean leader, and assist in the consolidation of the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile.

    The documents, which include transcripts of Kissinger's "telcons" — telephone conversations — that were never shown to the special Senate Committee chaired by Senator Frank Church in the mid 1970s, provide key details about the arguments, decisions, and operations Kissinger made and supervised during his tenure as national security adviser and secretary of state.

http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/
    An apoplectic Kissinger argues that the unspilling of CIA secrets is "worse than the days of McCarthyism" when the Wisconsin Senator went after the State Department. Kissinger had met with former DCI Richard Helms who told him that "these stories are just the tip of the iceberg," citing as one example Robert F. Kennedy's role in assassination planning. Ford wondered whether to fire Colby, but Kissinger advised him to wait until after the investigations were complete when he could "put in someone of towering integrity."

    ...Cabinet and sub-cabinet level officials led by Kissinger discuss ways and means to protect information sought by ongoing Senate (Church Committee) and House (Pike Committee) investigations of intelligence community abuses during the first decades of the Cold War.

    A newly declassified document has added to long-standing questions about whether Henry Kissinger, while secretary of State, halted a U.S. plan to curb a secret program of international assassinations by South American dictators.

    The document, a set of instructions cabled from Kissinger to his top Latin American deputy, ended efforts by U.S. diplomats to warn the governments of Chile, Uruguay and Argentina against involvement in the covert plan known as Operation Condor, according to Peter Kornbluh, an analyst with the National Security Archive, a private research organization that uncovered the document and made it public Saturday.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor
    Operation Condor was a campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, which started in 1968 and was officially implemented in 1975 by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America.

(So Kissinger ignores Democracy when pushing for policies that shame our country, but likes Democracy when it entails Russia rigging elections to annex Ukraine?)

    Washington, DC, November 2, 2007 - Then-national security adviser Henry A. Kissinger colluded with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to keep the U.S. Secretary of State in the dark about ongoing secret discussions between the Soviets and the Nixon White House, according to newly released Soviet-era documents, released last week by the Department of State.


After retiring as head of CIA counterintelligence, Angleton warned about Russian infiltration of the U.S. Government:

    James J. Angleton, former head of C.I.A. counterintelligence, contends that the K.G.B. is highly skilled and has penetrated top levels of Government and the C.I.A. itself. He and some other officials in the agency believe the Soviet presence is now almost impossible to counter.


But Congress hasn't taken the investigation of Russia's activities seriously:

You should consider why the CIA recently declassified reports that the KGB had 40% of Indira Gandhi's Congress on their payroll:

Or why Senators Grassley and Fienstein looked so grim after a recent meeting with Director Comey:

http://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/senate-intel-leaders-feinstein-and-grassley-grim-and-silent-after-trump-russia-briefings-with-comey/


Or why it seems that U.S. intelligences aren't telling Congress everything they know:

https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-03-02/house-committee-accuses-fbi-of-withholding-information-about-russia-probe


This is the number one reason why the inquiry into Russia's activities needs independent investigations. We don't know which members of our Government, including high-level appointees and elected officials, are Russian agents. We need an independent commission, a select committee in Congress, and an independent counsel, and we need to make sure the investigators are loyal to the United States.

It doesn't matter if they're Republicans or Democrats. A select committee could be all Republicans for all I care. What matters is that they're loyal to America, work together well, and interested in conducting an impartial and thorough investigation.

If Congress were serious about protecting national security, they would do everything in their power to ensure the investigations into Russia are free of Russian infiltration. And a select committee to investigate Russia's attack might go a long way toward improving communication between U.S. intelligence agencies and Congress.

	In the last half year, Russia has experienced an explosion of hate crimes. Some observers believe the Kremlin is using the rising tide of xenophobia as a weapon against its political rivals. If so, it's not a new strategy. The KGB often manipulated the threat of fascism and anti-Semitism to compromise political opponents of the Soviet Union.

	One of the most memorable cases was the KGB's Gray Wolves operation in the 1960s and 1970s. The goal of the operation was to prevent Baltic emigre and Jewish communities, who supported dissidents in the Soviet Union, from uniting against the Soviet regime. To do so, the KGB, via contacts inside the Baltic communities, disseminated documents related to the deportation of the Baltic population during the occupation of those regions by the Red Army in 1939. The documents came from the archives of the KGB's secret-police predecessor, the NKVD. In the documents, the KGB emphasized the Jewish names among the NKVD officers who took part in the deportations in order to stir up anti-Semitic sentiments.

	Russian President Vladimir Putin has emerged as a hero of several prominent alt-right figures, raising new questions about the Kremlin's influence on the far-right, white nationalist movement that has asserted itself as a new force in American politics.

	...

	Kevin MacDonald — who gave a speech at Spencer's NPI in late November about how "Jews remade America in their interests ... to make white America comfortable with massive non-white immigration and its own dispossession" — has written that the "demonization of Russia in Western media and political circles" is a Jewish campaign to undermine Putin.

	"Russia under Vladimir Putin," he wrote, "has proved to be far more nationalistic than is good for the Jews or for Israel."

	...

	Stroop noted that Americans involved with the World Congress of Families "have been looking to Russia as having the potential to 'save' Western civilization for a long time."

	"Based on quotations from white nationalists and racists like Matthew Heimbach and Pat Buchanan," Stroop added, "I'd say they've certainly looked to Putin as the savior of Christian civilization."

	For Heimbach, Putin's brand of orthodoxy, which opposes same-sex marriage, abortion, and globalism, "is the last institution standing for traditional values."

	But most observers are missing the point. Russia is helping Trump’s campaign, yes, but it is not doing so solely or even necessarily with the goal of placing him in the Oval Office. Rather, these efforts seek to produce a divided electorate and a president with no clear mandate to govern. The ultimate objective is to diminish and tarnish American democracy. Unfortunately, that effort is going very well indeed.

	...

	Active measures employ a three-pronged approach that attempts to shape foreign policy by directing influence in the following ways: state-to-people, people-to-people, and state-to-state. More often than not, active measures sidestep traditional diplomacy and normal state-to-state relationships. The Russian government today employs the state-to-people and people-to-people approaches on social media and the internet, directly engaging U.S. and European audiences ripe for an anti-American message, including the alt-right and more traditional right-wing and fascist parties. It also targets left-wing audiences, but currently at a lower tempo.

	Until recently, Western governments focused on state-to-state negotiations with Putin’s regime largely missed Russian state-to-people social media approaches. Russia’s social media campaigns seek five complementary objectives to strengthen Russia’s position over Western democracies:

    	Undermine citizen confidence in democratic governance;
    	Foment and exacerbate divisive political fractures;
    	Erode trust between citizens and elected officials and democratic institutions;
    	Popularize Russian policy agendas within foreign populations;
    	Create general distrust or confusion over information sources by blurring the lines between fact and fiction

	In sum, these influence efforts weaken Russia’s enemies without the use of force.

	Fed up with "political correctness," Donald Trump's fans rode a cycle of controversy and outrage to push him all the way to the top of a crowded field. Since then, however, they've waged a civil war over extremist rhetoric, fired a longtime supporter to quiet the backlash and now there's even talk of changing the rules to prevent them from taking over.

	No, it's not Trump's presidential campaign we're talking about. It's his leading fan site.

	...

	White supremacists, however, discovered that the censorship debate was a perfect chance to slip their propaganda into the mix again. One popular post on r/Mr_Trump actively promoted by one of the subreddit's moderators was a video parodying the song "Make A Man Out Of You" from Disney's "Mulan," which a user retitled "Troll The Cuck Out Of You" and paired with white nationalist lyrics. A sample from one (surprisingly well-sung) verse: "Look at demographics / they're not on our side / Vote your racial interests / or we won't survive."

	Unfortunately, peace is never achieved, as in these 100% states, the most radical Muslims intimidate, spew hatred, and satisfy their blood lust by killing less radical Muslims for a variety of reasons.

	...

	Today's 1.5 billion Muslims make up 22% of the world's population. But their birth rates dwarf the birth rates of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, and all other groups. Muslims will exceed 50% of the world's population by the end of this century.

http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-ex-russian-internet-troll-lyudmila-savchuk-a-1036539.html
	 SPIEGEL ONLINE: Is the work just done in Russia-language forums, or are there employees who write in English or German?

	Savchuk: Most work in Russian, but I know that some also write English posts. Ukrainian also plays a major role. I also heard about German, but not in this building.

	SPIEGEL ONLINE: Do you have evidence that other troll houses exist?

	Savchuk: Yes. The branch office in St. Petersburg is simply the one that has been best researched. A few colleagues reported about work trips to a Moscow office. There is also information about a further, highly secretive building in St. Petersburg.

	SPIEGEL ONLINE: How is the work organized?

	Savchuk: There are departments. Mine is responsible solely for Livejournal blogs and others are for commenting on the media. There's also a group that masquerades as journalists. They operate fake news portals that pretend to be Ukrainian news sites, with names like "Kharkiv News" or the "Federal News Agency." We had video bloggers. Some made themselves look like members of the Russian opposition.

	SPIEGEL ONLINE: Who do they sign their work contracts with?

	Savchuk: They don't even sign any contracts, which is why I am now submitting a lawsuit in a St. Petersburg court. That's the only way of dragging these fiends into the public eye. We want to show the world who is behind these troll factories. 

	...


	SPIEGEL ONLINE: Do you have the impression that these trolls are actually having any effect?

	Savchuk : Absolutely. The aggressiveness and the hatred spills over into the real world.

Service A resorted to similar provocations throughout the 1970s and well into the 1980s, viewing race relations as the issue most likely to destabilize the U.S. political system.



http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/trumps-bad-hombres-draws-jeers-spanish-lessons/	PHOENIX — Donald Trump’s utterance of “bad hombres” offended some of the millions of people watching the final presidential debate, who called it racially divisive.
	Within minutes of using the phrase Wednesday evening, the Republican presidential nominee was getting a lashing about his mishmash of English and Spanish.
	“We have some bad hombres here, and we’re gonna get ’em out,” said Trump, whose rise to the party nomination was fueled in part by his plan to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. He blamed these “hombres,” (OHM-brays) Spanish for men, for drug epidemics around the U.S.

They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

	My Mexican girlfriend just broke up with me for supporting Trump.
	Been slowly trying to red pill her lately. She's been reluctant to look too far into evidence for fear of any of it being true. Tonight it reached a breaking point and she started crying. Her father is an illegal immigrant so it's a touchy subject. She said she couldn't be with someone who didn't understand why Trump is so scary.
	My fellow centipedes, as a former Bernie supporter it's been a long journey to realize the truth. We need to MAGA and #DrainTheSwamp for the sake of our country, children around the world, and my relationship.

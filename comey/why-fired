	SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, I just want you to know that I have great respect for you. Senator Cornyn and I sit on the judiciary committee and we have the occasion to have you before us. You're a man of strength and I regret the situations we all find ourselves in. I just want to say that. Let me begin with one overarching question. Why do you believe you were fired?

	COMEY: I guess I don't know for sure. I believe — I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didn't know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe he's saying something that's not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 


Is that Comey's basis for thinking Trump fired him for the Russia investigation? he sounds unsure even about that

	So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
	FEINSTEIN: Do you believe the Russia investigation played a role?

	COMEY: In why I was fired?

	FEINSTEIN: Yes.

	COMEY: Yes. I've seen the president say so. 


says it multiple times, believes he was fired because of the Russia investigation because of what the President said

	Trump: Regardless of this reccomendation, I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, you know this Rusher thing with Trump and Russia it's a made up story it's an excuse for the democrats for having lost an election


	...Were you angry at Comey because of the Russia investigation?

	Trump...No look, let me tell you, as far as I'm concerned, I absolutely want this thing to be done properly


Hard to use to show intent I think? don't they say false exculpatory statements are better?



http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/trump-comey-russia-thing/index.html
	COMEY: That's a question I can't answer. I think it is a reasonable question. If, as the president said, I was fired because of the Russia investigation, why was the attorney general involved in that chain? I don't know. So I don't have an answer for the question. 


Comey really doubles-down on "the president said I was fired because of the Russia investigation"



	REED: Now, the Russian investigation as you've pointed out and my colleagues is one of the most serious hostile acts against this country's history undermining our core of elections is not a discrete event. It will likely occur again and is likely being prepared for '18, '20 and beyond. And yet the president of the United States advised you because at your own — some relationship to the investigation. Then he shows up in the Oval Office with the Russian foreign minister first as classifying you as crazy and a real nutjob. He said “I faced great pressure because of Russia; that’s taken off.” Your conclusion would be that the president, I would think is downplaying the seriousness of this threat. In fact, took specific steps to stop a thorough investigation of the Russian influence, and also from what you've said or what was said this morning, doesn't seem particularly interested in these hostile threats by the Russians. Is that true?

	COMEY: I don't know that I can agree to that level of detail. There's no doubt it's a fair judgment. It's my judgment I was fired because of the Russia investigation. I was fired in some way to change — or the endeavor was to change the way the Russia investigation is being conducted. That is a very big deal. And not just because it involves me. The nature of the FBI and the nature of its work requires that it not be the subject of political consideration. And on top of that, you have the Russia investigation itself is vital, because of the threat. And I know I should have said this earlier, but it's obvious, if any Americans were part of helping the Russians do that to us, that is a very big deal. And I'm confident if that is the case, director Mueller will find that evidence. 


interesting--didn't Comey make explicit he thinks the "Flynn" and "Russia" investigations are separate things?

	But then the explanations, the shifting explanations, confused me and increasingly concerned me. They confused me because the president and I had had multiple conversations about my job, both before and after he took office, and he had repeatedly told me I was doing a great job, and he hoped I would stay. And I had repeatedly assured him that I did intend to stay and serve out the years of my term. He told me repeatedly that he had talked to lots of people about me, including our current Attorney General, and had learned that I was doing a great job, and that I was extremely well-liked by the FBI workforce.

	So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation, and learned again from the media that he was telling privately other parties that my firing had relieved great pressure on the Russian investigation.


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/08/full-text-james-comey-trump-russia-testimony-239295
 	the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.

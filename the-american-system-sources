Many civilians are left without health and social services as the Ukraine government spends its limited funds on weapons and ammunition to fight the Russia-backed rebels in the east of the country.

The war in Eastern Ukraine began in early spring of 2014 after the popular uprising that ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in March of that year, it began sending troops and military equipment across the border into Eastern Ukraine to support pro-Russia separatists in the region.

At the same time, the President's staff, his campaign advisors, and the President himself all face criminal investigations or serious criminal allegations.


Mr. Manafort is among at least three Trump campaign advisers whose possible links to Russia are under scrutiny. Two others are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign, and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative.

...The F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Manafort began last spring, and was an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country’s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. In August, The Times reported that Mr. Manafort’s name had surfaced in a secret ledger that showed he had been paid millions in undisclosed cash payments. The Associated Press has reported that his work for Ukraine included a secret lobbying effort in Washington aimed at influencing American news organizations and government officials.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson used a pseudonym to discuss climate change in emails when he was the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, the New York attorney general's office has found.

As part of Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's investigation into whether the energy company was not forthcoming with shareholders and the public about the risks of climate change, Exxon Mobil says it has turned over 2.5 million pages of documents. According to Schneiderman's office, some 60 documents from the company included the email address Wayne.Tracker@exxonmobil.com, with "Wayne Tracker" being an alias Tillerson used from at least 2008 to 2015.

Additionally, Zimmer Biomet's political action committee made donations of $1,000 to Price's reelection campaign both before and after the introduction of the bill, according to CNN's report.

The President's associates' ties to Russia are the subject of a criminal investigation. 

Comey rejected the request for the FBI to comment on the stories, according to sources, because the alleged communications between Trump associates and Russians known to US intelligence are the subject of an ongoing investigation. 
http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/23/politics/fbi-refused-white-house-request-to-knock-down-recent-trump-russia-stories/


The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F.B.I. asked the N.S.A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed.

The F.B.I. has closely examined at least three other people close to Mr. Trump, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative; and Mr. Flynn.

All of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with Russian officials.

...The agency’s investigation of Mr. Manafort began last spring as an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country’s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. It has focused on why he was in such close contact with Russian and Ukrainian intelligence officials.

The FBI interviewers believed Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers. Although Flynn didn't remember all of what he talked about, they don't believe he was intentionally misleading them, the officials say.
Further, then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates delayed notifying the White House until after Flynn was interviewed. At that point, FBI Director James Comey did not object to notifying the White House counsel.
There is still an ongoing, broader FBI review of Flynn and Russia-related dealings.

Those who have been briefed were "taken aback" by the level of involvement.


U.S. intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president, according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue.

Some of those briefed were “taken aback” when they learned about Page’s contacts in Moscow, viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S. foreign policy, said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. The source added that U.S. officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the adviser’s talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being “actively monitored and investigated.”

House Republicans are moving to adopt a proposal weakening the chamber's outside ethics watchdog, removing its independence and establishing new limitations on its powers.

In a letter to leading Senate Democrats, Walter Shaub, Jr., the ethics office director, said the busy hearing schedule had overwhelmed his office. He said it had not completed ethics screening reviews on several nominees, which he described as a concern.

...“This schedule has created undue pressure on OGE’s staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews.”

Shaub’s letter to the senators comes just days before the Senate is set to hold a flurry of confirmation hearings beginning on Tuesday. In the letter, Shaub said that the schedule could leave some nominees with “potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues," though he did not mention any names.

“I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process,” said Shaub, who was appointed by President Obama to his position in 2013.

President Donald Trump signed off on press secretary Sean Spicer's decision to check aides' cell phones to make certain they weren't communicating with reporters by text message or through encrypted apps, multiple sources confirmed to CNN on Monday.

The decision sent a signal across the administration that Trump is furious at leaks from inside the White House. The sources also said the President gave his blessing before Spicer blocked reporters from the briefing last Friday.

When reached by CNN, Spicer denied that Trump was involved in either decision.

TAPPER: CNN's Evan Perez has reported that the intelligence community, that the U.S. intelligence community believes that Russia's ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, is not just an ambassador, but he is a spy and he's also a spy recruiter. Was that your understanding when you were at the agency?

MCMULLIN: Yes, that is my understanding.

But why it's significant is that you have somebody with enormous access here in Washington as an ambassador engaging with some of our senior-most officials in Congress and elsewhere who also has the skills that a spy would have to extract important information and to help run covert operations.

And, so, that's the kind of person we're dealing with here. It doesn't mean that all Ambassador Kislyak's activities are related to espionage, but it means he is a skilled practitioner of that -- of such operations.

TAPPER: Of spycraft.

MCMULLIN: That's right.

TAPPER: Can you give me just a kind of understanding of what that means exactly? He has skills in persuasion, extracting information when people don't want to give that information? What exactly do you mean?

MCMULLIN: He would have skills in compromising people, first and foremost, so that...

TAPPER: Potentially blackmailing them?

MCMULLIN: Blackmailing, but it's not just blackmail.

It is not as dramatic as that. It's about slowly easing people into a situation in which they are revealing information that they shouldn't reveal, that compromises them, which makes it easier to get additional information and additionally compromise them into the future, until you have something that amounts to a covert operation in which they are working on behalf of you. That's what his job would be.

Congress could initiate the process to create a different independent counsel for investigations by passing a law, as it did in 1978, when the Ethics in Government Act was passed.

The law, which was reauthorized several times until its sunset in 1999, was used more than a dozen times to initiate investigations, according to PBS Frontline.

Gingrich, when asked about the use of a special prosecutor Tuesday on Fox News, advised President Donald Trump to "take a lesson from the past" and assign a "very smart, independent person" to take on that investigatory role.

"Maybe somebody like Michael Mukasey, former attorney general [under George W. Bush] — put them in charge of the whole project

Mukasey is a close friend of a member of the President's inner-circle, and had previously promised to recuse himself from any investigations involving this individual.

Judge Michael B. Mukasey, if confirmed by the Senate as attorney general, will recuse himself from any matters involving his close friend Rudolph W. Giuliani, the White House said last night, suggesting he would do so with the ongoing criminal investigation of Bernard B. Kerik.

Congress has likewise rejected calls for a Congressional select Committee or independent commission to investigate the Russia scandal, deferring to the investigations House and Senate Intelligence committees.



But it "doesn't require" a special committee, he added.

"We have a Senate Intelligence Committee and a House Intelligence Committee, run by knowledgeable, responsible people," McConnell said.

The heads of both committees were caught lying at the behest of the White House to dispute news reports of contacts between the President's associates and Russian intelligence officials.



The Trump administration has enlisted senior members of the intelligence community and Congress in efforts to counter news stories about Trump associates’ ties to Russia, a politically charged issue that has been under investigation by the FBI as well as lawmakers now defending the White House.

Acting at the behest of the White House, the officials made calls to news organizations last week in attempts to challenge stories about alleged contacts between members of President Trump’s campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives, U.S. officials said.

The people want justice.


About two-thirds of Americans say a special prosecutor should investigate contacts between Russians and Trump campaign associates, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, and 55% say they are at least somewhat concerned by reports that some connected to the Trump campaign had contact with suspected Russian operatives.

Why Incumbents Rarely Lose
http://archive.nevadajournal.com/nj97/01/why.htm


The effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as incumbents are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann, only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, the lowest number in modern American history. Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and incumbents are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.

Mann, a Senior Fellow of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, has also noted that "Redistricting is a deeply political process, with incumbents actively seeking to minimize the risk to themselves (via bipartisan gerrymanders) or to gain additional seats for their party (via partisan gerrymanders)". The bipartisan gerrymandering that Mann mentions refers to the fact that legislators often also draw distorted legislative districts even when such redistricting does not provide an advantage to their party.

Gerrymandering of state legislative districts can effectively guarantee an incumbent’s victory by ‘shoring up’ a district with higher levels of partisan support, without disproportionately benefiting a particular political party. This can be highly problematic from a governance perspective, because forming districts to ensure high levels of partisanship often leads to higher levels of partisanship in legislative bodies. If a substantial number of districts are designed to be polarized, then those districts' representation will also likely act in a heavily partisan manner, which can create and perpetuate partisan gridlock.

The charts below show the enormous financial advantage enjoyed by incumbents. That's one of the reasons re-election rates are so high — incumbents generally don't have to work as hard to get their name and message out.
https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/incumbs.php


Political action committees have one overriding mandate: get the most bang for the buck. To maximize their dollars, nearly all PACs - particularly those of business groups - give the overwhelming proportion of their campaign dollars to incumbents. With congressional re-election rates typically in the 90 percent range, from their point of view that's a sound investment. Labor groups also give heavily to incumbents. Ideological groups, on the other hand, are much more likely to take a chance on political newcomers.
https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/pac2cands.php?cycle=2012


Political officeholders have long been seen as having a wide range of advantages over challengers: Name recognition is no problem, as they’re always in the public eye. Even if voters don’t agree with every position a long-time incumbent might take, they like the prestige and power that can come with seniority. And most importantly, officeholders make policy, so donors know to whom they should be signing the checks.

As noted by columnist David Brooks in the New York Times, in 1972 incumbents had an average spending advantage of 3 to 2 over challengers, and it’s since risen to 4 to 1.

...

    - Compared to challengers, incumbents on average have a $275,000 advantage in contributions in U.S. House elections and receive $28,000 more for state-legislature races.
    - Overall, Democratic incumbents have a 20- to 25-percentage-point advantage over challengers in the party’s contributions at the federal and state levels.
    - Interest groups motivated primarily by the desire for political connections tend to invest more in incumbents’ campaigns compared to groups that donate for more ideological reasons.
    - In U.S. House races, ideologically motivated groups contribute 16.57 percentage points more of all their donations to the incumbent party, while access-oriented groups favored incumbents by 40.52 percentage points.
    - As a consequence, access-oriented interest groups are thus responsible for approximately 60% of the financial advantage of House incumbents. In state legislatures, such groups weigh even more heavily, providing 71% of the financial advantage of incumbents.

PEWAUKEE, Wis. — Michelle Roelandts had a question for her congressman: If the Affordable Care Act and its premium subsidies were repealed, what would happen when her daughter turns 26 this year and needs to get her own health insurance while attending law school?

Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a durable Wisconsin Republican who has served in the House since 1979, had little to offer in response. “If I could give you an answer today, I would, but I can’t,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said at a town-hall-style meeting on Saturday, where about 70 people packed a room at the Pewaukee Public Library.

Constituents ask their members of Congress for town halls

Close to 100 constituents lined up in a Montgomery converted church venue on Thursday to question U.S. Rep. Martha Roby and U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers about access to healthcare, immigration reform, President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to foreign powers and freedom of the press — among a number of other issues.

But they didn’t receive any answers. Roby, who represents Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, and Rogers, who represents the 3rd Congressional District including Auburn, were not there.

Congress is in recess this week. While many members of Congress scheduled town halls or similar public meetings in their home districts, Roby and Rogers did not. Around the country this week, citizens, as they did in Montgomery, have decided to hold their own meetings with or without the representatives present.

WASHINGTON — Newly elected congressional Democrats had just a week to savor their victories before coming face to face with a harsh reality of Washington.

At a party-sponsored orientation session, the freshmen — many still giddy from winning close races in which they espoused grand plans to change the Capitol’s toxic ­atmosphere — were schooled in their party’s simple list of priorities for them.

Raise money. Raise more. Win.

The newcomers were told to devote at least four hours each day to the tedious task of raising money — so-called ­dialing for dollars — so they could build a war chest and defend their seats, according to those present. That’s twice as much time as party leaders expect them to dedicate to committee hearings and floor votes, or meetings with constituents.

Interestingly enough, it started with a protest.


(which particular protest is up to the reader)



Whether stimulated externally or ignited internally, ferment during the years from 1761 to 1766 changed the dynamics of social and political relations in the colonies and set in motion currents of reformist sentiment with the force of a mountain wind. Critical to this half decade was the colonial response to England’s Stamp Act, more the reaction of common colonists than that of their presumed leaders.

Both loyal supporters of English authority and well-established colonial protest leaders underestimated the self-activating capacity of ordinary colonists. By the end of 1765 … people in the streets had astounded, dismayed, and frightened their social superiors.

THE Boston Tea Party is one of the best-known incidents in American history, ranking in fame with Columbus' voyages, the landing of the Pilgrims, and a few battles like Lexington and Concord. In foreign countries it is perhaps the only fact associated with the town of Boston. This fame is well deserved, for the Boston Tea Party was the catalyst that brought about the American Revolution.
http://www.cambridgehistory.org/content/boston-tea-party-and-american-revolution


------

The famous Boston Tea Party was organized by the Sons of Liberty, the underground movement that was the precursor to the American Revolution.


A group of nine Boston craftsmen and shopkeepers gathered the evening of December 16, 1765, at Chase & Speakman’s distillery to write a letter to Andrew Oliver, the stamp officer appointed for Massachusetts. It demanded he appear at noon the next day at the Liberty Tree to publicly resign his office. “Provided you comply with the above,” the letter said, “you shall be treated with the greatest Politeness and Humanity. If not. . . .”

The next morning Bostonians who braved the day’s stormy weather found notices posted all over town, calling for the “True-born Sons of Liberty” to meet Oliver at the Liberty Tree. Oliver resigned his office in front of two thousand rain-soaked townspeople. There was now no one to enforce the Stamp Act in Massachusetts. At the time, Boston had fifteen or sixteen thousand inhabitants, and most were women and children, so the turnout was significant.

These American revolutionaries wanted a better form of government for their countrymen, based on ideas like "all men have natural rights," "government should be for the people," "no man is above the law," and "all men are created equal."


It is true that the political arrangements established by the Constitution were the result in large measure of the historical experience and the circumstances of the newly independent colonies, and much has been written about this experience and these circumstances. It is also true, however, that the Framers brought to their deliberations a coherent philosophy about the ends and means of government.

This philosophy, sometimes implicit and sometimes made explicit, guided their deliberations and informed the choices they made among competing solutions to pressing problems. This philosophy of government incorporated three major political doctrines: natural rights, republicanism, and constitutionalism. These ideas were part of the common intellectual currency of eighteenth century America.

It is important, if we are to understand the events surrounding the adoption and ratification of the Constitution, to remember that the discussion of these issues was not limited to a small intellectual elite. A knowledge of these philosophies was widespread. This is not, of course, to say that most Americans had read the works of philosophers such as Locke or Montesquieu. Many, however, had become acquainted with their ideas by reading the pamphlets that were published by the hundreds during the Revolution as well as during the debates over the adoption and ratification of the Constitution. In addition, the doctrines of these and other philosophers had also been preached from numerous pulpits and promulgated in the pages of many of the thirtyeight newspapers that existed in the colonies in 1775.

The modern reader must be struck, for instance, by the frequency with which the authors of the numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles published during the ratification controversy, appealed to the authority of the man they called " the celebrated Montesquieu." These pamphlets were intended for a relatively wide audience, and one can only assume that the authors took it for granted that their readers would know who Montesquieu was and be acquainted with his theories of republican government. It surely is one of the more interesting aspects of this episode in American history that these were people who took ideas seriously, who believed, in short, that ideas have consequences. The challenge before them, as they understood it, was to apply the ideas to the circumstances of the moment, to transform the ideas into political reality.

most of the world then believed in "the divine right of kings," placing monarchs above the people and the law.

The main way of instilling obedience, however, was propaganda. Through teaching, preaching and writing, the message was sent that sedition was morally wrong, un-Christian, and would result in divine retribution. Even those who escaped punishment in this life would burn in hell fire.
https://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/367/367-04.htm


------

The early American revolutionaries spread these ideas to gain support for their movement.


As Bernard Bailyn wrote in the foreword to his 1965 book, Pamphlets of the American Revolution, there were more than four hundred pamphlets published in the colonies on the imperial controversy up through 1776, and nearly four times that number by war’s end in 1783.2 These pamphlets varied in their theme and approach, including tracts of constitutional theory or history, sermons and orations, correspondence, literary pieces, and political debate. Bailyn originally decided to print seventy-two of these in a significant project that began with fourteen dated 1750–1765. In a two-hundred-page general introduction to what promised to be a multivolume effort, Bailyn developed an interpretation about the content of what was to follow, an analysis that he would deepen a few years later in the seminal Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967).

No American document has had a greater global impact than the Declaration of Independence. It has been fundamental to American history longer than any other text because it was the first to use the name “the United States of America”: in this sense, the Declaration was the birth certificate of the American nation. It enshrined what came to be seen as the most succinct and memorable statement of the ideals on which that nation was founded: the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the consent of the governed; and resistance to tyranny. And, as the first successful declaration of independence in world history, its example helped to inspire countless movements for independence, self-determination, and revolution after 1776. One of its most enthusiastic admirers was the nineteenth-century Hungarian nationalist, Lajos Kossuth: for him, the Declaration was nothing less than “the noblest, happiest page in mankind’s history.”

The Civil Rights movement brought increased prosperity to all Americans


Even public-school desegregation, often derided today as a misplaced priority or an outright failure, has had lasting economic benefits, according to recent research. Long-term studies by economists Sarah Reber, Orley Ashenfelter, William Collins, Albert Yoon and Rucker Johnson have found that Southern school integration increased blacks’ graduation rates, test scores, earnings and adult health status, while reducing the probability of incarceration.

It is difficult to identify precisely what led to these results (whether it was increased resources, better teachers or peer effects) and to differentiate the impact of schooling from that of expanded job opportunities for black graduates. But these complex interconnections only confirm that the civil-rights revolution was an economic watershed.

A striking feature of that revolution is that, for the most part, economic gains for black Southerners didn’t come at the expense of white Southerners. At no time during this era did average white incomes fall as black incomes rose. Nor did Southern whites’ graduation rates and test scores drop after desegregation; instead these indicators continued their long-term progress toward national norms.

What we see, in other words, is not a redistribution in the name of historical justice, but an integration of black workers into the regional economy. When we consider that the civil-rights movement opened the South to inflows of capital, creativity and new enterprises from around the world, it becomes clear that most white Southerners were also long-term beneficiaries of this revolution.

Martin Luther King Jr. made these words from the Declaration of Independence a centerpiece of his "I have a dream" speech.


One of the most important influences on the speech, especially in its introduction, was the words the Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson, an original Founding Father. King seemed to regard the ideal of liberty and equality of that founding document as an “American Scripture,” as Pauline Maier calls it. The words and thoughts of that Declaration wove themselves into the thought, feeling and rhetoric of King as a minister and leader.

America's founders were among the first abolishionists.


In February, 1790, the Society petitioned the new United States Congress under the Constitution for a federal prohibition of slavery [see Petition below].  When Congress declined to hear the petition, Franklin responded with one of his most biting satirical hoaxes in the Federal Gazette of March 23, 1790.  Speaking as one Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim, a member of the Algerian governing council, he gave the arguments against a supposed petition for granting freedom to Christians held in slavery in Africa.  They were, of course, the same arguments used in the United States Congress against the petition presented by the Pennsylvania abolition society.  It was, appropriately, Franklin’s last public statement.  He died less than a month later, on April 17, 1790.
http://wjmi.blogspot.com/2011/02/benjamin-franklin-on-slavery.html


Ten years before his death, Washington told David Humphreys that, with the proper opportunities, "the rising generation" of slaves could create for themselves "a destiny different from that in which they were born"—suggesting that Washington believed servitude was not the natural condition of black people and that the abolition of slavery was within the nation's grasp. 
http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Washington_George_and_Slavery#start_entry


Following the Revolutionary War, Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the 1777 constitution of Vermont, followed by Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act in 1780. Other states with more of an economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, also passed gradual emancipation laws, and by 1804, all the northern states had abolished it. Some slaves continued in servitude for two more decades but most were freed.

Also in the postwar years, individual slaveholders, particularly in the Upper South, manumitted slaves, sometimes in their wills. Many noted they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population increased from less than one per cent to nearly ten per cent from 1790 to 1810 in the Upper South as a result of these actions.

As President, on 2 March 1807, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves and it took effect in 1808, which was the earliest allowed under the Constitution. In 1820 he privately supported the Missouri Compromise, believing it would help to end slavery.

But the American Revolution changed him, and by the end of his life, he had arranged for all of his slaves to be freed.




On rare occasions, the high and mighty planters freed the children they had by slave women. Wiencek's investigations led him to conclude that Washington most likely did not have children by his slaves. Something beyond blood ties motivated him.

His experiences in the Revolutionary War also helped change Washington's outlook. Black soldiers made up about one-quarter of the Continental Army at Yorktown and played a crucial role in the final assault on the British positions. He met Phyllis Wheatley and helped publish her works. Thomas Jefferson gave the poetess only contempt.

Through Washington, Wiencek puts to rest the lie that Virginia's 18th century elite were merely men of their time, unable and unwilling to change the plight of their slaves. Yes, Washington often was constrained by politics and the mores of his time. Yes, he waited until he was in the grave, beyond the reach of ridicule and argument from his peers. But he did act.
http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-01-04/entertainment/0312300766_1_slaves-henry-wiencek-man-s-debt


According to Wiencek, his thoughts on slavery may have also been influenced by the rhetoric of the American Revolution, the example of the thousands of blacks who enlisted in the army to fight for independence, the anti-slavery sentiments of his idealistic aide John Laurens, and his knowledge of the ability of the enslaved black poet Phillis Wheatley, who in 1775 wrote a poem in his honor.

just as they inspired King and the Civil Rights movement

“My friends,” Dr. King said in his Detroit sermon, “all I’m trying to say is that if we are to go forward today, we’ve got to go back and rediscover some mighty precious values that we’ve left behind. That’s the only way that we would be able to make of our world a better world, and to make of this world what God wants it to be. . . .”

King led that fight more skillfully and convincingly than any American in our history. He offered a hopeful, transcendent idea of how America could be truly great. Meacham observed in Time that during his memorable speech at the Aug. 28, 1963, march on Washington, “King — like Jefferson and Lincoln before him — projected an ideal vision of an exceptional nation . . . In doing so, King defined the best of the nation as surely as Jefferson did in Philadelphia in 1776 or Lincoln did at Gettysburg in 1863.”

Surely, the right of the whole people to vote is here clearly implied. For however destructive in their happiness this government might become, a disfranchised class could neither alter nor abolish it, nor institute a new one, except by the old brute force method of insurrection and rebellion. One-half of the people of this nation to-day are utterly powerless to blot from the statute books an unjust law, or to write there a new and a just one. The women, dissatisfied as they are with this form of government, that enforces taxation without representation,-that compels them to obey laws to which they have never given their consent, -that imprisons and hangs them without a trial by a jury of their peers, that robs them, in marriage, of the custody of their own persons, wages and children,-are this half of the people left wholly at the mercy of the other half, in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this government, every one of which was based on the immutable principle of equal rights to all. By those declarations, kings, priests, popes, aristocrats, were all alike dethroned, and placed on a common level politically, with the lowliest born subject or serf. By them, too, me, as such, were deprived of their divine right to rule, and placed on a political level with women. By the practice of those declarations all class and caste distinction will be abolished; and slave, serf, plebeian, wife, woman, all alike, bound from their subject position to the proud platform of equality.

The preamble of the federal constitution says:

"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and established this constitution for the United States of America."

It was we, the people, not we, the white male citizens, nor yet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed this Union. And we formed it, not to give the blessings or liberty, but to secure them; not to the half of ourselves and the half of our posterity, but to the whole people-women as well as men. And it is downright mockery to talk to women of their enjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they are denied the use of the only means of securing them provided by this democratic-republican government-the ballot. 

After her arrest on charges of voting illegally in the 1872 federal election, Susan B. Anthony undertook an exhaustive speaking tour of all twenty-nine of the towns and villages of Monroe county, and twenty-one towns Ontario county.  The title for her lecture was "Is it a Crime for a Citizen of the United States to Vote?"  Her speaking tour was effective enough in winning support for her position that the prosecution sought and obtained an order transferring her trial to the United States Circuit Court at Canandaigua, where it was believed fewer potential jurors would be prejudiced in her favor.

Guided by the enlightenment ideas of tolerance

Toleration or tolerant pluralism was also a major theme in American Enlightenment thought.  Tolerance of difference developed in parallel with the early liberalism prevalent among Northern Europe’s merchant class.  It reflected their belief that hatred or fear of other races and creeds interfered with economic trade, extinguished freedom of thought and expression, eroded the basis for friendship among nations and led to persecution and war. Tiring of religious wars (particularly as the 16th century French wars of religion and the 17th century Thirty Years War), European Enlightenment thinkers imagined an age in which enlightened reason not religious dogmatism governed relations between diverse peoples with loyalties to different faiths. The Protestant Reformation and the Treaty of Westphalia significantly weakened the Catholic Papacy, empowered secular political institutions and provided the conditions for independent nation-states to flourish.

our nation's founders saw America, as Madison put it, as promising "asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every Nation and Religion."



The real story of religion in America’s past is an often awkward, frequently embarrassing and occasionally bloody tale that most civics books and high-school texts either paper over or shunt to the side.

...As for Adams and Jefferson, they would disagree vehemently over policy, but on the question of religious freedom they were united. “In their seventies,” Jacoby writes, “with a friendship that had survived serious political conflicts, Adams and Jefferson could look back with satisfaction on what they both considered their greatest achievement—their role in establishing a secular government whose legislators would never be required, or permitted, to rule on the legality of theological views.”

Nearly 9-in-10 (88 percent) Americans agree that America was founded on the idea of religious freedom for everyone, including religious groups that are unpopular. Ninety-five percent of Americans agree that all religious books should be treated with respect even if we don’t share the religious beliefs of those who use them. Nearly two-thirds (66 percent) of Americans agree that we must maintain a strict separation of church and state.

...Most religious, racial and ethnic groups are viewed relatively favorably in the U.S. although most Americans do not hold strongly favorable views. More than 8-in-10 Americans say they have a favorable opinion of African-Americans (89 percent) and Hispanics (82 percent). More than 8-in-10 Americans also report holding favorable views of Catholics (83 percent) and Jews (84 percent), two groups once the object of widespread prejudice in the country. Mormons are viewed favorably by two-thirds (67 percent) of the public, and a majority of the public also reports holding a favorable view of American Muslims (58 percent).

[America's] glory is not dominion, but liberty. Her march is the march of the mind. She has a spear and a shield: but the motto upon her shield is Freedom, Independence, Peace. This has been her declaration: this has been, as far as her necessary intercourse with the rest of mankind would permit, her practice.

Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend the general cause by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example. She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself, beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force.

I rejoice that liberty . . . now finds an asylum in the bosom of a regularly organized government; a government, which, being formed to secure happiness of the French people, corresponds with the ardent wishes of my heart, while it gratifies the pride of every citizen of the United States, by its resemblance to their own.

I always consider the settlement of America with Reverence and Wonder-- as the Opening of a grand scene and Design in Providence, for the Illumination of the Ignorant and the Emancipation of the slavish Part of Mankind all over the Earth.

On these occasions I consider how mankind may be connected like one great family in fraternal ties—I endulge a fond, perhaps an enthusiastic idea, that as the world is evidently much less barbarous than it has been, its melioration must still be progressive—that nations are becoming more humanized in their policy—that the subjects of ambition & causes for hostility are daily diminishing—and in fine, that the period is not very remote when the benefits of a liberal & free commerce will, pretty generally, succeed to the devastations & horrors of war.

Even as the United States poured billions of dollars into foreign military programs and anti-terrorism campaigns, a small core of American government-financed organizations were promoting democracy in authoritarian Arab states.

Two hundred and thirty years ago, James Madison proposed that our constitution be designed, in part, to protect the public from money influencing political decisions against the public good.


Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.

It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm.

Jefferson warned that the "aristocracy" of America's "monied corporations" could lead to the catastrophic "ruin of it's people."


in this respect England exhibits the most remarkable phaenomenon in the universe in the contrast between the profligacy of it’s government and the probity of it’s citizens. and accordingly it is now exhibiting an example of the truth of the maxim that virtue & interest are inseparable. it ends, as might have been expected, in the ruin of it’s people. but this ruin will fall heaviest, as it ought to fall, on that hereditary aristocracy which has for generations been preparing the catastrophe. I hope we shall take warning from the example and crush in it’s birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and to bid defiance to the laws of their country.
https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-10-02-0390


Early Americans had a far more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of corporations than the Court gives them credit for. They were much more comfortable with retaining pre-Revolutionary city or school charters than with creating new corporations that would concentrate economic and political power in potentially unaccountable institutions. When you read Madison in particular, you see that he wasn’t blindly hostile to banks during his fight with Alexander Hamilton over the Bank of the United States. Instead, he’s worried about the unchecked power of accumulations of capital that come with creating a class of bankers.

So even as this generation of Americans became comfortable with the idea of using the corporate form as a way to set priorities and mobilize capital, they did their best to make sure that those institutions were subordinate to elected officials and representative government. They saw corporations as corrupting influences on both the economy at large and on government — that’s why they described the East India Company as imperium in imperio, a sort of “state within a state.” This wasn’t an outcome they were looking to replicate.

In 1827, James Madison, known as the father of the Constitution, wrote that "incorporated companies with proper limitations and guards may, in particular cases, be useful; but they are at best a necessary evil only."

Eighty-six years later, Teddy Roosevelt rode a populist wave of "trust-busting."


The longer-term effects of the strike were just as important. Where the federal government in the past had been strongly pro-business in such labor disputes, it now acted in a more neutral manner. This portended a shift in mentality that eventually led to much increased regulation such as the Hepburn Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act.

It would be decades before unions won full protection and recognition in the eyes of the federal government. The Wagner Act of 1935 was the capstone in that regard, driven by the perils of the Great Depression. However, if that process had a beginning point, it could be said to be the strike of 1902 and Teddy Roosevelt's response.

Teddy Roosevelt was one American who believed a revolution was coming.

He believed Wall Street financiers and powerful trust titans to be acting foolishly. While they were eating off fancy china on mahogany tables in marble dining rooms, the masses were roughing it. There seemed to be no limit to greed. If docking wages would increase profits, it was done. If higher railroad rates put more gold in their coffers, it was done. How much was enough, Roosevelt wondered?

Wealthy Donors Pump Millions Into Sanders’ Campaign In Last-Ditch Effort To Destroy His Credibility

But they got a Presidential candidate.


"Economic inequality didn't become a mass issue until Occupy," said Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University history professor and co-editor of the leftist magazine Dissent. "It was the catalyst for publicizing these ideas and getting Americans to talk about them in ways they hadn't before."

In other words, Sanders might not be where he is today, trailing Hillary Clinton by just a few percentage points in the polls, if Occupy hadn't helped focus attention five years ago on the ideas that are now at the core of his campaign.

This has not gone unnoticed in the political world, either.

Among the obstacles Mr. Biden would face would be fund-raising: He has struggled when methodically calling upon donors.

Still, his supporters have been cheered by the small donations amassed by Mr. Sanders and have wondered if the vice president could use a similar approach. 
https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/us/politics/joe-biden-campaign.html


Yet, the candidates are seeking to downplay their reliance on major donors to their campaigns and supportive super PACs – often relying on misleading math tricks to make the case that their efforts are funded by regular folks. There are a few reasons: they don’t want to appear beholden to the very rich increasingly subsidizing presidential politics, and their operatives believe that small donors will continue donating throughout the campaign, and can eventually be mobilized as part of the campaign’s activist army to help get out the vote.

While the potential of small donors helped power Barack Obama’s historic 2008 campaign, the financial benefits are not immediately apparent for most presidential candidates this time around. In fact, some of the candidates who most touted their small-donor cred raised relatively insignificant percentages of their cash from small donations.

One big modern error in interpreting freedom of speech and press comes from not treating it as freedom from government shielding itself against public examination of its affairs through use of criminal libel or license but as a right to be heard or seen. Newspapers were never under any obligation to publish whatever someone had to say no more than a university or town was viewed obligated to provide persons with a public soapbox. It is all about government and its agents subjectively determining what speech or publication it considers defamation against government and punishing such without truth being a defense.

The judiciary must also be independent, according to Hamilton, so that it may fulfill its main purpose in a constitutional government: the protection of the "particular rights or privileges" of the people as set forth by the Constitution.

Americans of both parties fundamentally reject the regime of untrammeled money in elections made possible by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling and other court decisions and now favor a sweeping overhaul of how political campaigns are financed, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll.

...More than four in five Americans say money plays too great a role in political campaigns, the poll found, while two-thirds say that the wealthy have more of a chance to influence the elections process than other Americans.

The vast majority of votes cast for the United States House of Representatives this fall will be in races where the winner is an almost foregone conclusion. Only about 25 of the 435 races are considered truly competitive by the Cook Political Report.

In Maryland, Republican Dr. Mark Plaster is running an underdog campaign for one of those seats, considered “safe” for the incumbent, who is a five-term Democrat.

The challenge of unseating an incumbent is made all the more difficult by the actual make-up and shape of Maryland’s 3rd congressional district, which has been called one of the most gerrymandered in the country.

MOSCOW — Now that President-elect Donald J. Trump has chosen Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, to be the next secretary of state, the giant oil company stands to make some major gains as well: It has billions of dollars in deals that can go forward only if the United States lifts sanctions against Russia.

As head of America’s largest oil company, Mr. Tillerson has earned a friendship award from Russia and voiced skepticism about American sanctions that have halted some of Exxon Mobil’s biggest projects in the country.

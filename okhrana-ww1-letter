Tsarist secret police act strange for years before war, assassinating their own officials, fomenting unrest against tsar. Doing "social exepriments" with "police socialism," control over Russian society, etc.

Azef assasinations, Father Gapon, intriuges in Russo-Japanese war?

They bought off French journalists and Poincare was on call for any "trouble" in the Balkans. Okhrana agent Rachkovsky helped secure this alliance.

Then the arch-duke of Austria assassinated by an associate of the Russian military attache, who is suspiciously abset while the whole thing is going down

(Ferdinand Foch msysterously absent too?)



Okhrana infiltrated Bolsheviks enough that they couldn't tell who was who.

Lenin's entourage, "right-hand man" Malinovsky, then Zhitomirsky, 

Lenin says he wants to use a war to foment communism, and that's exactly what happens--war leads to revolutions all over world


German foreign ministry helps fund bolsheviks, bolsheviks arm revolution against their government, but they keep the foreign ministry, who continue to damage Germany.


Russian officials in position to have knowledge of Apis plot end up high-ranking Soviet officers.


Sazanov encouraged Tzar to mobilize, told official who stopped mobilization when Tsar had cold feet to "smash his telephone." This ruined Tsar and brought about Russian revolution--during civil war, Sazanov sabotages White Army opportunities to align with Finnish army and take Petrograd.


Okhrana agents infiltrated Aufbau and got in contact with Ludendorff, and he ended up helping to divide White army between two princes.


	The Bolsheviks took advantage of this anti-war and anti-government sentiment to channel it into support for their cause around the world. Bienno Rosso (“two red years”) in Italy, the 1917 army mutinies in France, the November Revolution in Germany (and the subsequent Spartacist uprising and formation of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic), the Aster Revolution in Hungary (and subsequent formation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and even shorter lived Slovak Soviet Republic), and the Kiev Bolshevik Uprising in Ukraine were all an immediate result of the war and were all brought about, with varying levels of directness, by Bolsehvik propaganda and agitation:


	...The Tsarist government, the German government, and the Russian provisional government all at various points funded and distributed Bolshevik propaganda to their own detriment.


	...The case of von Jagow and his accomplices at the German Foreign Ministry is particularly awkward: Jagow acted suspiciously to start the war, then acted carelessly to fund the Bolsheviks, only for the Bolsheviks to turn around and arm and support the anti-war German Revolutionaries, who proceeded to act suspiciously to keep Jagow in office!


Kerensky sabotaged Finish support for Whites, pushed after promises to end war while army hated war, armed bolsheviks after kornilov affair, gave up Russia to bolsheviks.


Falkenyahn shifts war to Germany v. France while Russia in war.

	Though less ruthless and thorough in the suppression of opponents, and enormously less numerous than the GPU to which we have become accustomed, the Okhrana was second to no other secret political police of its day. Where peasant risings and mutinies gave it the pretext, it proclaimed martial law and used gallows and firing squad. In other provinces, it made use of the power of administrative deportation without trial, up to a maximum of five years in Siberia. But a roster of millions of prisoners in concentration camps would have seemed an incredible nightmare to this little band of routine-incrusted police officials. According to the testimony of its chief, Vasiliev, at the height of its power it never had more than one thousand secret agents in all Russia, nor more than one hundred in the capital. He complains that he had "very few” operatives abroad and, every time a congress was held in foreign parts, had to further debilitate his Moscow and Petersburg forces by sending some of his best agents.

	But, with its years of political experience, the Okhrana sensed earlier than Lenin the nature of the new political situation, and prepared, too, to “go underground” once more. With forces that seem numerically so modest today, it now developed a system of espionage that eclipsed even the Zubatov and Gapon experiments. If, at every stage of our story so far we have found a police agent in the midst of each fairly numerous gathering, now we shall find them penetrating into the topmost secret hierarchies of the Social Revolutionary Party and the Bolshevik faction of the Social Democratic Party.

	Upon assuming the directorship of Fontanka, Beletskii ordered a massive penetration of Russian society by his field bureaus especially among the peasantry, railway workers, high school students and Russia's military and naval forces 'without delay' ...Like Plehve, he wished no nook nor cranny of possible dissent to escape his attention. However, Beletskii was not satisfied with simply spying on society, he wanted to control it as well. The relationship between public opinion (the Duma and the press) and the workers' movement became the focus of Beletskii's experiment in social control.

	...Fontanka devised a stategy to manipulate the Bolshevik movement into disrupting moderate social democracy. Bolshevism by its very nature offered the perfect vehicle for this strategy. Historians have noted that the decision to adopt this strategy was a grossly ill-considered one. After all what did Beletskii and the Special Section accomplish? As Laura Engelstein and Victoria Bonnell (among others) have pointed out, Fontanka's strategy ensured the demise of moderate social democracy in Russia by producing frustration and anger amongst young workers, the potential leaders of their class. Beletskii's strategy drove these young men and women into the arms of the radical intelligentsia, who promised that by rejecting moderation in favour of extremism the workers would attain the economic and political goals they so desired. The end result contributed, therefore, to placing Lenin and his Bolsheviks at the forefront of the labour movement.

    New Lights on the Russian Revolution

    June 14, 1919

    …Mr. Spargo traces the intricate history of the Russian revolutionary parties and shows how the Socialists in 1902 slit in two, the majority (Bolsheveki) following Lenin, and the minority (Mensheviki) following Plechanov. At first the Bolsheviki were nurst by the Czar, later by the Kaiser. The most violent of the Bolshevik leaders in the Duma, Malinovsky, a close friend of Lenin, turned out to be a police spy and provocateur, and his fiery speeches attacking the Government and the bourgeoisie were written for him by Beletzky of the Police Department.

    …The charge that the Bolshevik movement was secretly encouraged by the Russian Government before the war is confirmed by Serge Persky in the latest volume of his journalistic articles, From Nicholas II to Lenin. He has a photograph of notes of a speech delivered by Malinovsky in the Duma which had been OK’d and annotated by the Minister Maarof. Pravda (“Truth”), the official organ of the Bolshevists, was subsidized by the Okhrana (secret police), and Lenin himself in 1910 or 1911 had relations with them. When this was exposed Lenin defended himself in the same fashion as when charged with receiving German aid:

        "It was not the Okhrana that made use of us but on the contrary we that made use of the Okhrana. Without doubt the Okhrana has rendered great services to our party without ever obtaining anything from us."

	...“. . . At the end of the tragedy you (the capitalists and landowners, the kings and statesmen of the bourgeoisie) will be ruined and the victory of the proletariat will either be already achieved or at any rate inevitable.”

	 …To neutralize the chronic protest of French Socialists and Liberals against its operations on French soil, the Okhrana bribed French newspapers and journalists of the right who were willing to follow a pro-Russian line. According to an exposé of the Okhrana written in 1919 by one of its former senior officials, V. K. Agafonov, it financed a journalists’ club in Paris and paid regular subsidies to several important French newspapers, including the Echo de Paris, the Gaulois, and the Figaro. The last-named organ, according to Agafonov, for a while received 24,000 rubles—about $10,000—monthly from the Okhrana.

	When Izvolsky took over the Russian Embassy in Paris he promoted an arrangement with the French government for influencing French opinion that was more official, but hardly less conspiratorial, than the crude undercover operations of the Okhrana: the Russians would open a special credit, drawn upon the Czar’s secret funds, for the French government, which would then undertake to buy up the consciences—and the pens—of its own journalists in behalf of joint objectives. A letter sent by the Russian Prime Minister in October 1912 to his French opposite number—at that time Poincaré—pointed out one of the advantages of the proposed system: It would help keep within bounds “certain appetites and certain rivalries” in the French press which the Russians had learned from bitter experience were apt to be stirred up when they approached foreign journalists directly.

	...For a long time, not only the Russian military attache but the Ambassador, Hartwig, were in intimate contact with Apis. There is no suggestion that he personally pocketed any Russian funds, but the Russians looked upon him as their particular friend, if not quite their agent, and quite naturally tried to build him up in influence.
 
	...Artamonov, the military attache, continued, however, to see his Serbian colleague and friend nearly every day. It was natural enough: they were conducting a joint secret-service operation across the nearby Austrian border, with the help of a chain of Serbian customs inspectors and frontier guards who had been recruited as secret operatives of Apis. Artamonov's contribution to the operation had been to furnish some $1600--an impressive sum by contemporary Balkan standards--toward financing the clandestine network that Apis was setting up on Austro-Hungarian soil, particularly in Bosnia.
 
	The deepest unresolved mystery of Sarajevo is the degree of direct Russian guilt in the assassination. Did Hartwig, the Russian minister, or Artamanov, his military attache, know in advance what Apis was plotting? Albertini demonstrates convincingly that it is most unlikely Hartwig was informed of the murder plot. Artamanov is another story a very queer and confused stoiy. There is some testimony that he not only knew Apis was organizing the assassination, but that he asked St. Petersburg for approval and got it.

	...There may be one man still alive who knows the whole story; the Russian assistant military attaché, Captain Alexander Werchovski, who replaced Artamanov during his absence. A friend of Werchovski, a Polish nobleman named Louis de Trydar-Burzynski, stated in his memoirs, published in Italy in 1926, that “the assassination [at Sarajevo] was perpetrated with the support of the Russian military attaché at Belgrade, Captain Werchovski…” Werchovski, he continued, “was later War Minister in the Kerensky government; he was a young man whom I had known very well for years, and he told me quite frankly the truth about the origins, preparations and execution of the plot.” Unfortunately, Werchovski, if he is living today, is not likely to tell any more about the case; when last heard of, he held a high command in the Red Army—a curious detail in itself.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/spot-psychopath/
	We think of psychopaths as killers, alien, outside society. But, says the scientist who has spent his life studying them, you could have one for a colleague, a friend – or a spouse

	There are a few things we take for granted in social interactions with people. We presume that we see the world in roughly the same way, that we all know certain basic facts, that words mean the same things to you as they do to me. And we assume that we have pretty similar ideas of right and wrong.

	But for a small – but not that small – subset of the population, things are very different. These people lack remorse and empathy and feel emotion only shallowly. In extreme cases, they might not care whether you live or die. These people are called psychopaths. Some of them are violent criminals, murderers. But by no means all.

    Professor Robert Hare is a criminal psychologist, and the creator of the PCL-R, a psychological assessment used to determine whether someone is a psychopath. For decades, he has studied people with psychopathy, and worked with them, in prisons and elsewhere. “It stuns me, as much as it did when I started 40 years ago, that it is possible to have people who are so emotionally disconnected that they can function as if other people are objects to be manipulated and destroyed without any concern,” he says.

    ...“A high-scoring psychopath views the world in a very different way,” says Hare. “It’s like colour-blind people trying to understand the colour red, but in this case ‘red’ is other people’s emotions.”

	The Startling Accuracy of Referring to Politicians as 'Psychopaths'

 	...The question, then, is whether it is reasonable to believe that people with serious abnormalities in the way they interact with the world can be found running for (and winning) office. However unsettling as this may be, the answer seems to be yes. It's possible for psychopaths to be found anywhere -- including city hall or Washington, D.C. Remember, psychopaths are not delusional or psychotic; in fact, two of the hallmarks of psychopathy are a calculating mind and a seemingly easy charm. 

	In his landmark book on psychopathy, The Mask of Sanity, researcher Hervey Cleckley theorized that some people with the core attributes of psychopathy -- egocentricity, lack of remorse, superficial charm -- could be found in nearly every walk of life and at every level, including politics. Robert Hare, perhaps the leading expert on the disorder and the person who developed the most commonly used test for diagnosing psychopathy, has noted that psychopaths generally have a heightened need for power and prestige -- exactly the type of urges that make politics an attractive calling.

	Vladimir Lenin
	The Tasks of the Youth Leagues 

	...But is there such a thing as communist ethics? Is there such a thing as communist morality? Of course, there is. It is often suggested that we have no ethics of our own; very often the bourgeoisie accuse us Communists of rejecting all morality. This is a method of confusing the issue, of throwing dust in the eyes of the workers and peasants.

	In what sense do we reject ethics, reject morality?

	In the sense given to it by the bourgeoisie, who based ethics on God's commandments. On this point we, of course, say that we do not believe in God, and that we know perfectly well that the clergy, the landowners and the bourgeoisie invoked the name of God so as to further their own interests as exploiters. Or, instead of basing ethics on the commandments of morality, on the commandments of God, they based it on idealist or semi-idealist phrases, which always amounted to something very similar to God's commandments.

	We reject any morality based on extra-human and extra-class concepts. We say that this is deception, dupery, stultification of the workers and peasants in the interests of the landowners and capitalists.

	We say that our morality is entirely subordinated to the interests of the proletariat's class struggle. Our morality stems from the interests of the class struggle of the proletariat.

	The old society was based on the oppression of all the workers and peasants by the landowners and capitalists. We had to destroy all that, and overthrow them but to do that we had to create unity. That is something that God cannot create.

	This unity could be provided only by the factories, only by a proletariat trained and roused from its long slumber. Only when that class was formed did a mass movement arise which has led to what we have now -- the victory of the proletarian revolution in one of the weakest of countries, which for three years has been repelling the onslaught of the bourgeoisie of the whole world. We can see how the proletarian revolution is developing all over the world. On the basis of experience, we now say that only the proletariat could have created the solid force which the disunited and scattered peasantry are following and which has withstood all onslaughts by the exploiters. Only this class can help the working masses unite, rally their ranks and conclusively defend, conclusively consolidate and conclusively build up a communist society.

	That is why we say that to us there is no such thing as a morality that stands outside human society; that is a fraud. To us morality is subordinated to the interests of the proletariat's class struggle. 


http://uselessdissident.blogspot.com/2008/11/interview-with-yuri-bezmenov-part-three.html
	Bezmenov: ...This was my instruction: try to get into large-circulation, established conservative media; reach filthy-rich movie makers; intellectuals, so-called ‘academic’ circles; cynical, egocentric people who can look into your eyes with angelic expression and tell you a lie. These are the most recruitable people: people who lack moral principles, who are either too greedy or too much suffer from self importance. They feel that they matter a lot. These are the people who KGB wanted very much to recruit.


https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=ohiou1398772391
	...According to Aleksei Myagkov, a KGB agent who defected in the 1970s, “it was not only the Cheka that made use of their [the Okhrana’s] methods; they also persist to this day, and are being extensively used by the KGB,” and that KGB recruits “were all astonished at the similarities between the Tsarist system and the KGB’s in the way of working with agents. 

	Studying the changes between the Tsarist Okhrana and the Soviet Cheka is significant as well, as it accurately highlights the major difference between Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. Under the latter regime, the secret police force, and the state’s use of it for political subjugation, changed drastically in both scale and intent. The brutal police repression seen during the Bolshevik’s first few years surpassed the most violent days of Russian autocracy. The state justified every action the Cheka took as necessity to protect the revolution. For the Bolsheviks, the end justified the means – but the means used were barbaric. Lenin did not see the implementation of terror in terms of morality; in a speech given in February 1920, he stated bluntly, “for us this question is one of expediency.

This is a work in progress, but I've found this:


- The Tsarist secret police infiltrated revolutionary organizations, the press, and governments not only in Russia but around the world. France is the most well documented--there, Okhrana agents like Rachkovsky ingratiated themselves with French Leadership and secured the French-Russian military alliance that made World War I possible. The Okhrana also had an extensive operation to buy off journalists in the French press, who helped keep President Poincare in power with his knowledge and support. Elements in the Russian government saw Poincare as reliable should Russia get involved in a war arising from "Balkan affairs." 

- The Okhrana had infiltrated the Bolsheviks to the point where the Okhrana felt they could control them and ordinary revolutionaries were constantly paranoid. Multiple members of Lenin's "inner circle" were Okhrana agents, and Lenin would act to defend them from charges of their duplicity. Reportedly, Lenin himself had relations with the Okhrana and claimed he "used them" for his ends.

- Lenin and the Bolsheviks envisioned a global revolution and used the war to "further the revolution." The war was disastrously unpopular among citizens and soldiers and naturally pit them against their governments. At the same time, the Bolsheviks distributed huge amounts of propaganda among citizens and soldiers blaming the war on their Capitalist and "imperialist" governments. As the war took its toll, these governments became increasingly unstable and more ripe for revolution.

- The revolution wasn't just intended for Russia: during and after the war, Bolshevik-inspired rebellions and revolutions took place in Italy, France, Hungary, and Germany.

- The Bolsheviks' allies were often at the forefront of anti-war movements, such as Bela Kun in Hungary or Rosa Luxemburg in Germany. Luxemburg organized anti-war protests since before the war started, and Kun led a propaganda campaign preluding the formation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Kun received direction from Lenin over radio for the Soviet revolution in Hungary, and the underground socialist "Shop Stewards" received funds and weapons from the Soviets for the The November revolution in Germany.

- Often times, high-level leadership in these countries did inexplicable things to make these revolutions possible. In France, Poincare's minister of the interior ignored pleas to stop Bolshevik propaganda from being spread among the army, and was found responsible in part for the French army mutinies of 1917. In Germany, as the government was negotiating the war's end, German Admiralty, without knowledge of the government, ordered a "suicide mission" to attack allied fleets (see http://alphahistory.com/weimarrepublic/kiel-mutiny/, https://books.google.com/books?id=xXOxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA186). The sailors promptly mutinied, and this sparked the November revolution.

- In Russia, the war's unpopularity was precisely the reason the Tsar abdicated, yet Kerensky, as head of the provisional government, ordered a massive push while simultaneously letting the Soviets "propagandise" and "democratize" the army as to make them ineffectual. When General Kornilov marched on the Soviets (with the full knowledge and agreement of Kerensky, according to some investigations, see: https://books.google.com/books?id=5Y7UDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA193&lpg=PA193), Kerensky armed the Bolsheviks against Kornilov. These would form the Red Army, who Kerensky would do more or less nothing to stop in the October revolution. Later, during the Russian civil war, Kerensky spoke out against Finnish independence at a key moment when the Whites needed their support to take Petrograd.

- Likewise, many officials who acted to start and prolong the war went on to help the Bolsheviks in other ways. The Russian Foreign Minister Sazonov encouraged the Tsar to mobilize the army after Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia and even directed an official to smash his telephone when the Tsar got cold feet. During the Russian civil war, while ostensibly working for the Whites, Sazonov would sabotage the White Army's opportunity to secure Finnish support to take Petrograd.

- Many members and associates of the German Foreign Ministry, such as Bethmann-Hollweg and von Jagow, acted suspiciously to start the war. Hollweg and Jagow supported writing a "blank cheque" of support for Austria-Hungary, and at a key time in the crisis sabotaged a mediation proposal by deleting lines in a forwarded telegram (among other ways). Later, the German Foreign Ministry would run a decisive campaign to support the Bolsheviks, including funds, propaganda, and securing passage to Russia for Lenin over German territory, even as Bolshevik propaganda undermined German military and society. Even though the Foreign Ministry became synonymous with imperialism, the Bolshevik-armed revolutionaries in Germany left the old Germany Foreign ministry largely intact after the November revolution.

- During Germany's initial push, some German commanders, such as Lieutenant Colonel Hentsch and Field Marshall Bulow, acted inexplicably to stop the German's push and retreat at the battle of Marne. This was a turning point in the war that converted it from a "war of movement" to trench warfare. After General von Moltke was fired for this, his replacement, General Falkenhayn, ignored opportunities to defeat Russia decisively in order to focus his forces in a war of attrition and costly battles on the Western Front, most famously at Verdun. The effect of this was to keep Russia in the war while prolonging the war in general.


There's more to be done, but my best guess at what's going on so far is this: Before the war, the Bolsheviks already had allies in high places across European governments and the Russian secret police, or the Bolsheviks were themselves a project of an overly ambitious secret police. They started the war deliberately with hopes of channeling the resulting anti-government sentiment into revolutions where they could put themselves in power, with a system of government that would let them take power more absolutely. After the war, the Soviets continued this pattern of using war and revolution to spread their influence throughout the globe during the cold war (here's some notes on their involvement in starting the Korean war: https://pastebin.com/3yq1y5yj).

This is important for today, since it looks like this same group has an extensive network of contacts and agents of influence across the press and governments around the world (see: my previous emails), even moreso than they did 100 years ago. To stop this kind of thing from happening again, we need to know their scope, how they work, and what they're capable of. If today they are anything like they were then, they don't care about any particular country (they certainly didn't care about Russia during World War One)--I think it's more like an international organization than the project of any one government. Instead, they use countries and misguided forms of "patriotism" to "divide and conquer" the rest of the world.

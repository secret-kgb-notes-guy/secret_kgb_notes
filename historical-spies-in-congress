	“Bab” (cover name in Vassiliev notebooks): Described as “A senator, vice chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.  Visited the USSR”.  References to in 1933 as having been a circa-1928 contact via an questionable agent.  Likely Senator William H. King (D. Utah), who visited the USSR in 1923 and in 1933 was the ranking majority member of the Senate Finance Committee.  The Senate Finance Committee, like other Senate committee, did not have a “vice-chairman”, but the ranking majority member was the second ranking position after the chairman. (Alternative translation: Bob).

	Wirt, William A., and “Wirt Affair”: Nationally known k-12 school administrator.  In 1934 Dr. Wirt 
attended a Washington cocktail party at the home of Alice Barrows, an official of the U.S. Office 
of Education deeply involved in CPUSA activities.  Wirt claimed that at the party a member of 
President Roosevelt’s “brain trust” (as the press named them) of influential advisors had told him 
that FDR was a manipulated front man for a Communist plan to take power and would be 
replaced with an American “Stalin”.  A U.S. House committee chaired by Rep. Alfred Bulwinkle 
(D. NC) heard Wirt’s testimony.  His charges faded when those he identified turned out to be 
obscure bureaucrats and left-wing journalists rather than prominent FDR advisors.

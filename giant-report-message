giant report on aims, methods of active measures, Comey, Clinton, Trump, dossier


Sorry this took so long...

I wanted to be thorough.

Here is a series of articles that build off each other. It goes over Comey's actions during the election and recently with respect to the goals and methods of active measures, looks at Clinton and Trump in detail, answers some questions about the "dirty dossier," then makes a guess at what the Russians might be planning next.

This is sort-of separate, but it makes a guess at one of the "deals" Trump might think he can get away with:

Hope this helps!

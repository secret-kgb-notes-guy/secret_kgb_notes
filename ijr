IJR's Kyle Becker has written a long list of articles that promote or echo Russian propaganda, some of which are listed here:

>Footage provided by the FSA purportedly shows Syrian rebels using a U.S.-made TOW missile to finish off a rescue helicopter sent to secure pilots ejected from a downed Russian Su-24 fighter jet.

>While Russian fighter pilots descended by parachute from a plummeted Su-24, footage allegedly shows Syrian rebels shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and trying to kill them in the air - a violation of the Geneva conventions.

...

>The Russians refute that their fighter jet violated Turkish air space. Here is an alleged radar report of the incident

>...The U.S. and NATO claim the fighter jet did enter Turkish airspace

...

>In 2014, President Obama signed bipartisan legislation to arm and train Syrian rebels. In October 2015, U.S. officials suspended the program, calling it an “operational pause.”

Becker cites [this zerohedge.com article](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-24/caught-tape-syrian-rebels-destroy-russian-helicopter-us-supplied-anti-tank-missile) in suggesting the U.S. is ultimately responsible for downing the Russian helicopter, but that doesn't add up:

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-arms-idUSKBN0TE1KJ20151125
>A Syrian military source said rebels are making heavy use of U.S.-made anti-tank missiles paid for by Saudi Arabia and supplied via Turkey in recent weeks and the weapons are having an impact on the battlefield.

>The so-called TOW missile is the most potent weapon in the arsenal of rebel groups battling President Bashar al-Assad, and has been seen in action more frequently since Russia intervened with air strikes on Syria on Sept 30.

>A rebel group was shown using one of the guided missiles to destroy a grounded Russian helicopter in Syria on Tuesday.

http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-faced-huge-risks-in-trying-to-rescue-its-pilots-that-turkey-shot-down-2015-11
>As it turns out, reports say the Mi-8 came under intense small-arms and Triple-A fire — most likely 12.7, 14.5, and 22mm cannons — and was forced to land. The TOW missile shot to finish the job was the coup de grâce.

Zero Hedge is widely known to be [Russian propaganda](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/unmasking-the-men-behind-zero-hedge-wall-street-s-renegade-blog), and the incident is widely blamed on the U.S. in Russian propaganda outlets:

http://ijr.com/2014/07/158716-russian-terrorists-discuss-mh17-crash-captured-audio-eerie-flaw-timing/
>It's been revealed that there are some glaring holes in a Youtube video claiming audio evidence of Russian separatists discussing the takedown of Malaysia Airlines MH17. The flight crash killed 298 innocent people in a Russian breakaway region of Ukrainian territory.

>The supposedly captured audio of two Russian separatists discussing the crash was widely posted in the media. But when it comes to information warfare regarding Russia and the Ukraine, it's wise to be highly cautious before spreading such disinformation. This case shows one reason why.

>...The one major problem is that many claim the timestamps of the video's “creation time” put it at July 16, one day prior to the Malaysia Airlines crash on July 17. Then it was published by “Anonymous” on July 18. This screenshot comes via Zerohedge

>...In addition to the timestamp issue, there is the problem of logic. Why and how would unencrypted military communications be captured and cleared for public dissemination through a Youtube channel so quickly?

>Wouldn't it have been more effective for the Ukrainian government to verify the transmission as authentic, and host a press conference inviting CNN, the BBC, and other major world outlets to report on it?

>A videoblogger DahBoo77 dissected the timestamp and purportedly found the video was uploaded 810 times - prior to the plane being shot down. Other questions have arisen, one posed on Zerohedge, about similarly formatted videos, such as one uploaded by “Ukraine Investigation” blaming “Cossacks” for chaos in Russia.

Becker is helping spread conspiracy theories that the Ukrainian government framed Russian separatists for the downing of flight MH17, citing [Zero Hedge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/unmasking-the-men-behind-zero-hedge-wall-street-s-renegade-blog) again.

This narrative also appears throughout Russia's propaganda network:

Russian separatists shot down MH17 with a missile [supplied by Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/asia/malaysia-air-flight-mh17-russia-ukraine-missile.html).

Becker seems to dislike Ukraine. When the Ukrainian Parliament turned on the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych to stop his [crackdown](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/20/ukraines-parliament-just-threw-president-yanukovych-under-the-bus-thats-great-news/) on protesters, Becker was quick to point out that some Ukrainian protesters are violent "nationalists:"

http://ijr.com/2014/02/116664-ukrainian-revolt-death-toll-hits-75-eu-scrambles-peace/
>The revolts in the Ukraine have led to a death toll of 75, as the European Union implores the Ukrainian leadership to seek peace. Ukrainians in Kiev and other cities have been taking their frustrations to the streets in an effort to pull their nation free of the Russian orbit.

>However, the opposition in the Ukraine is mixed between “nationalists,” and citizens who are fed up with the corrupt, oppressive government under President Viktor Yanukovych. The Ukrainian parliament just passed a resolution for the security services to restrain their crackdown.

Here he suggests that it was actually Ukraine who was behind the DNC leaks all along:

http://ijr.com/wildfire/2017/01/768714-a-comprehensive-list-of-smoking-gun-evidence-the-russian-government-hacked-the-election/
>There is an alternative explanation behind the DNC hacks, one unproven, but remotely plausible: Ukrainian hackers wanted to sabotage the DNC and Clinton campaign to make the presumed incoming President Hillary Clinton furious at the Russians. Such a turn of events would benefit the Ukraine in that it would reinvigorate U.S. foreign policy resistance to Russian territorial incursions.

And here he suggest Ukrainians are pedophiles:

http://ijr.com/2015/04/300281-ukrainian-girl-does-a-pole-dancing-routine-it-stuns-the-crowd-to-find-out-shes-only-8-years-old/
>Ukrainian girl Emily Moskalenko blows away the judges at the “Next Star” television competition. What makes this unique, however, is that she is only 8 years old.

>The question is raised whether it's automatically inappropriate for a young girl to perform a “pole-dancing” routine, due to its obvious associations in society.

>Or is there something to be said for the athleticism and gymnastic talent of the girl, thus making this routine more of its own art form?

>That's up to the audience to decide.

--------

Often, Becker is inconsistent. He likes the mainstream media when it makes the U.S. Government look bad:

http://ijr.com/2014/10/188068-scoff-new-york-times-blasts-biggest-myth-george-w-bush-iraq-war-water/
>NY Times Just Blasted Out of Existence Biggest Myth About George W. Bush & Iraq War

Unless it's a member of the U.S. Government who happens to be a foreign agent:

http://ijr.com/2017/02/801691-michael-flynns-resignation-letter-is-a-punch-in-the-face-to-the-mainstream-media/
>Michael Flynn's Resignation Letter is a Punch in the Face to the Mainstream Media

Of course, the Russians don't like our "mainstream media" either:

https://www.rt.com/usa/375231-fail-stream-media-mainstream-fake-news/

https://www.infowars.com/new-figures-prove-the-mainstream-medias-audience-is-literally-dying/

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-10/mainstream-media-relevant-anymore


Becker does seem to like Russia's "alternative media" though, such as infowars:

http://ijr.com/2017/03/823523-get-know-alex-jones-close-personal-way-never-ever-dreamed/
>If you've heard this name bandied about in hushed dark corners of the internet but got that 'icky' feeling to stay away from it, and never could muster up the courage to scratch the itch of conspiratorial piqued curiosity, you're in luck.

>Super Deluxe, maestros of funny and enlightening viral videos, encapsulated the wild and captivating media persona that seems to keep 'keeping on,' regardless of the political environment.

--------

Becker can be misleading. Here, Becker accuses two polarizing Democrats of being hypocritical in calling for AG Sessions to resign:

http://ijr.com/2017/03/816520-nancy-pelosi-nailed-dead-to-rights-about-not-meeting-russian-ambassador/
>Memory error or deliberate lie, under oath or not, it's more than ironic that the Senator would ask for a colleague's resignation while arguably making the same mistake.

>Another Democratic politician can be added to the list of those who don't appear to remember meeting with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) herself, former Speaker of the House, has also demanded Sessions resign while failing to recall that she has met with the ambassador.

Sessions [lied under oath](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html) about his meetings with Kislyak, a [Russian spy](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1703/03/cg.01.html). Lying under oath is a felony.

--------

Becker helps spread Kremlin conspiracy theories to smear people they don't like:

http://ijr.com/2016/09/703663-fbi-director-let-hillary-off-the-hook-now-we-know-why-he-wouldnt-talk-about-the-clinton-foundation/
>FBI Director Let Hillary Off the Hook. Now, We Know Why He Wouldn't Talk About The Clinton Foundation.

Becker suggests FBI Director James Comey "let Hillary off the hook" because he worked for two companies that donated to the Clinton Foundation and his brother was the Director of Real Estate for the law firm that audited their taxes.

Russian propaganda outlets targeting conspiracy theorists seem to like this theory as well:

Becker seems to be generally on-point with most Russian propaganda narratives:

http://ijr.com/wildfire/2017/01/768645-wapo-reports-russian-hackers-take-down-vermont-power-grid-then-the-electrifying-truth-comes-out/
>Conjuring up images of hoodied Russian hackers working furiously in dark Moscow coffeehouses to penetrate the U.S. power grid, the fear-inducing story can be seen in the ripple effect of the Democrats' new-found obsession with a Russian adversary that President Obama tried to ~overcharge~ reset relations with and had once even shrugged off.

>...It also would behoove journalists and pundits to be restrained in their criticism of anyone skeptical of government or media-driven reports that Russians hacked the election DNC.

>That's not carrying water for a future Trump administration, but demanding transparency and due diligence in reportage before Americans jump to political conclusions or diplomats provoke a second “Cold War.”

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-31/washington-post-published-fake-news-story-about-vermont-utility-getting-hacked-russi
>Ooh, sounds menacing right? By the looks of it, the Russians were quickly working their vodka driven ways towards shutting down all of our lights, Christmas tree included. The only problem with this narrative is that it's a complete fabrication.

https://www.rt.com/usa/372448-washingtonpost-retracts-russian-hackers/
>Glen Greenwald, a prominent US journalist who was among those breaking the story on Edward Snowden’s leaks on the NSA spying scandal, said the case suits America’s anti-Russian agenda. “It matters even more because it reflects the deeply irrational and ever-spiraling fever that is being cultivated in US political discourse and culture about the threat posed by Moscow,” Greenwald wrote.

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5l8nl8/so_let_me_get_this_straight_unnamed_officials_of/

Becker, RT, infowars and others jumped on WaPo's retraction as proof that mainstream media is "fake news" and spiraling into anti-Russian "fever."

Russia is said to have a "network" of propaganda outlets, which may explain why many ideas and narratives favoring the Kremlin tend to appear across a wide-range of outlets at the same time:

Becker generally tries to cast doubt on ties between Russia and Trump:

http://ijr.com/2017/03/823276-kremlin-wants-americans-know-met-clinton-campaign-advisers/
>**Vladimir Putin Wants Americans to Know Clinton Campaign Advisers Met with the Russians**

>Leave it to the Kremlin to try setting the record straight after a U.S. media frenzy spinning any contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government as evidence of election sabotage.

http://ijr.com/wildfire/2017/01/772788-latest-us-intelligence-memo-released-it-declares-russia-had-preference-for-hillary-over-trump/
>Secondly, there is still no hard evidence tying the Putin regime to the hacks released by WikiLeaks—we still have to take the intel community's word for it.

http://ijr.com/wildfire/2017/02/802527-the-new-york-times-has-once-again-released-a-bombshell-report-about-trump-this-time-it-involves-the-russians/
>Once again, leakers with classified information are contacting The New York Times with stories that give the appearance of impropriety, yet that may or may not be the case. For example, the comment alluded to regarding then-candidate Trump hoping that Russian intelligence would unearth Hillary Clinton's emails is widely considered to be a joke.

>But as the American people have come to learn time and time again, the news media environment is long on accusation and innuendo but short on substantiated facts that the Trump administration has inappropriate ties to foreign governments or broke the law.

http://ijr.com/2017/03/823991-trey-gowdy-drops-cold-hard-truth-media-missing-chasing-trump-conspiracy-theories/
>South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy gives something for the media to focus on besides spinning and striking out on its millionth Trump-Russia conspiracy theory to explain why Hillary Clinton lost the election.

http://ijr.com/2017/03/819875-democrats-argue-that-russians-rigged-the-election-for-trump-so-how-do-hillary-supporters-explain-this/
>And with that ... the media was off and running. Never mind that undermining the legitimacy of the duly elected president — based on no more than indignation that the DNC happened to be illegally and wrongly hacked — was a known objective of the Kremlin all along.

Here Becker argues Putin didn't prefer Trump, he merely didn't want Clinton to win:

http://ijr.com/wildfire/2017/01/772788-latest-us-intelligence-memo-released-it-declares-russia-had-preference-for-hillary-over-trump/
>It is vital to point out what the New York Times reported following the election on this matter:

>>The Russians were as surprised as everyone else at Mr. Trump’s victory, intelligence officials said. Had Mrs. Clinton won, they believe, emails stolen from the Democratic committee and from senior members of her campaign could have been used to undercut her legitimacy. The intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia tried to help Mr. Trump was first reported by The Washington Post.

>If the Russians were calculating that Hillary Clinton was likely to win, then intelligence operations intended to harm her would necessarily be undermining her presidency; they would also exhibit a “preference” for Donald Trump.


Here he seems to be saying that Putin secretly wanted Clinton to win (although the article is hard to decipher):

http://ijr.com/2016/08/663775-vladimir-putin-the-shadowy-figure-who-has-become-a-force-in-the-us-election/

>The twists and turns of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign—email hacks of the Democratic Party machine and praise of foreign leaders by a “nationalist” presidential candidate—make little sense unless one focuses on the powerful figure behind the scenes: Vladimir Putin.

>It is easy to mistake Putin's various statements about Trump—he is “talented and bright,” as well as the “absolute leader” in the race—as an endorsement. Contrary to widespread belief, however, the ex-KGB Colonel is not necessarily backing Trump, but hedging his bets in the U.S. election.

>Hillary Clinton has been notoriously weak against Putin. Her “reset” button signaled to Putin exactly the kind of naiveté the Russian President desires in a U.S. leader. Clinton's passive foreign policy set the table for the Russian leader to scoff at President Obama's “red line” in Syria.

>After Clinton left office, Putin continued his recent aggression against former Soviet republics by leading an incursion into The Crimea, which left a deep scar on Ukraine. When it comes to the “Grand Chessboard,” Putin was playing 3-D chess, and Hillary Clinton was playing checkers.

>As a plot twist, Donald Trump recently discussed Putin's military annexation of The Crimea this Sunday on ABC's “This Week.”

>The Republican presidential candidate argued that Putin would not go into Ukraine if he were president

Here, Becker admires Putin, saying he looks "angelic" in a shirtless piuture of the Russian President hiking:

Here, Becker appears to be telling the truth.

The Kremlin likes to employ journalists in their warfare:

http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-09/russia-propaganda-eastern-ukraine-separatists-e-mails/seite-3
>Some journalists find it exciting not to remain neutral in their reporting, but to become involved in psychological warfare instead, says Dmitri R., who worked as an independent journalist in eastern Ukraine and was supposed to become a propagandist. He worked for Newsfront, the channel associated with the rebels. He quit his job when he realized how the regime was exploiting journalists. He is unwilling to use his real name, fearing reprisals. When asked how free he was to report on events in the eastern Ukraine war zone, Dmitri R. laughs bitterly: "Whenever I asked if I could use the material to record material independently, I was always given the same answer: This is not the time for journalism. Journalism is something for peace. For the war, which is also an information war, we need information soldiers. We truly regarded ourselves as information soldiers. And it made the work seem very special." 

http://uselessdissident.blogspot.com/2008/11/interview-with-yuri-bezmenov-part-three.html
>Most of the activity of the department was to compile a huge amount of information on individuals who were instrumental in creating public opinion: publishers, editors, journalists, actors, educationalists, professors of political science, members of parliament, and representatives of business circles. Most of these people were divided roughly into two groups. Those who would toe the Soviet foreign policy, they would be promoted to the positions of power through media and public opinion manipulation. Those who refused the Soviet influence in their own country would be character-assassinated or executed physically, con-revolution.

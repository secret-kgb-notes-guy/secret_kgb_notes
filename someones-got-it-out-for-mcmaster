On May 15th, Greg Miller and Greg Jaffe of the Washington Post broke a story that heavily implied Trump damaged national security by leaking information in a conversation with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html


The next morning, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster held a press briefing asserting that "the premise of the article is false":


http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/16/mcmaster_national_security_put_at_risk_by_leaks_like_washington_post_story.html
	What I'm saying is really the premise of that article is false, that in any way the president had a conversation that was inappropriate or that resulted in any kind of lapse in national security.

	...in the context of that that discussion, what the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html
	Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State’s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.

	The Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.


http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/16/mcmaster_national_security_put_at_risk_by_leaks_like_washington_post_story.html
	QUESTION: ...Did the president reveal a city? I mean, the spin is that the president revealed the name of the city, and that gave away information that undermined an ally.

	MCMASTER: OK, I will answer that.

	OK, so, all of you are very familiar with the threat from ISIS. All of you are very familiar with the territory it controls. If you were to say, "Hey, from where do you think a threat might come from territory that ISIS controls?," you would probably be able to name a few cities, I would think.

	And so it was -- it was nothing that you would not know from open source reporting in terms of a source of concern. And it had -- it had all to do with operations that are already ongoing, had been made public for months.


Specifically, McMaster shot-down the implication of the Washington Post story that Trump's disclosure was inappropriate and damaged national security. He did not confirm or deny that Trump revealed classified information (and I'm not sure if he legally can). But it is implied that Trump revealed the name of the ISIS-controlled city where Israel "detected the threat," and that this disclosure was appropriate and innocuous.

Yet a few hours later, a number of public figures and journalists (including one of the authors of the WaPo article) were ready to hit the press essentially (or directly) calling McMaster a liar:

	By Jennifer Rubin  May 16


What makes them so sure? McMaster's main point was that the conversation didn't damage national security, contradicting the WaPo article. And unlike the WaPo authors, McMaster was actually present for the conversation and is qualified to judge national security breaches. And McMaster has a reputation for integrity. So why assume he is a liar?

What's interesting is that McMaster has a unique role in Trump's cabinet: he is one of the few cabinet members to improve our national security situation. Remember this timeline: https://pastebin.com/nCwti01C Flynn was compromised, and McMaster undid his changes to the NSC, moving the suspicious people Flynn brought on to other positions. And McMaster is also unique in that he was not brought-on by Trump's transition team, and Pence, who's selection as VP appears to have alarmed some Trump associates (http://time.com/4409330/donald-trump-mike-pence-vice-president-2/), reportedly "played a role" in picking McMaster.

On top of this, there are reports that McMaster has fallen out of favor with Trump, or that Trump even intends to fire him:


http://www.newsweek.com/trump-mcmaster-israel-russia-fired-national-security-adviser-jared-kushner-616735
	Is H.R. McMaster, the White House national security adviser, on the way out? By some signs, he is: President Donald Trump not only excluded him from a key meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his national security adviser Monday night in Jerusalem, he was kept “outside the King David [Hotel] room during the course of the entire meeting,” according to an eye-catching Israeli account.

	Taken alone, the perceived shaming wouldn’t amount to much: Trump has a habit of slighting his aides in public. But the incident came only days after a report in The New York Times that McMaster had fallen out of favor with the president. Trump had “complained that General McMaster talks too much in meetings,” and “the president has referred to him as ‘a pain,’” The Times said in a report that was not challenged by the White House. By the time Trump left Israel for his meeting in Rome with the Pope, right-wing news sites closely allied with the so-called “nationalist” wing of the White House were serving up full throated criticism of McMaster, a distinguished Army general.

	...Another writer at the liberal-leaning Foreign Policy web site quoted from McMaster’s book, Dereliction of Duty, to suggest he risked grave injury to his reputation if he stuck around much longer.


Compounding this, as the Newsweek article points out, some of the "alt-right" press has started attacking McMaster, calling him soft on "Islamic terrorism" and spreading conspiracy theories alleging his involvement in plots to manipulate the President with fake intelligence reports.

Ostensibly, firing McMaster would be disastrous for Trump's image: his administration is under investigation for collusion with Russia, he just fired his FBI Director, and the rest of his top advisors are all embroiled in some sort of Russia-related scandal. And McMaster appears to be one of the few (if only) advisors to counter Russia's influence in the White House and disagree with Trump: Trump overrode McMaster's decision to remove Ezra Cohen-Watnick from his position as Senior Intelligence Director, which troubled the CIA, after Cohen-Watnick appealed to Kushner and Bannon. Reportedly, Cohen-Watnick went on to search for intelligence intercepts to validate President Trump's wiretapping claims. With this being the only major disagreement between McMaster and Trump in the press, firing McMaster would raise even more questions about President Trump's honesty, relationship with Russia, and commitment to national security. Firing McMaster would not only remove the only key Trump advisor who is both sane and free of ties to Russia, it would be a public scandal nearly as big as Trump's firing of Yates or Comey.

Or, would be--except the recent press reports accusing McMaster of being a liar and calling for his resignation have created the perception that he deserves to be fired or even wants to be fired. Since, in the abstract, firing someone who deserves it or wants it isn't surprising, these reports have mitigated any scandal that would result from firing McMaster, at least in the eyes of the public. They are making it easier for Trump to fire McMaster.

Yet, after the Washington Post released an article saying that Jared Kushner, among other things, wanted to set up a secret back-channel with the Russians (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-ambassador-told-moscow-that-kushner-wanted-secret-communications-channel-with-kremlin/2017/05/26/520a14b4-422d-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html), some in print and social media took to beating-up on McMaster again:

	At the time of Mr. Kushner’s inquiries and the Kremlin’s response, relayed through Mr. Kislyak, Jared Kushner was a private citizen. There was no Trump Administration in December.

	McMaster says 'not concerned' after Kushner back-channel reports

	...It's clear we got our hopes up too high for this dude.

	What a sham he is. Guess he is right at home being crooked in this administration.

	Should have held onto your credibility McMaster. You're going to need it.


(one interesting exception: the Russian propaganda site zerohedge used McMaster's statement to argue Kushner's meetings with the Russians are a "non-story:" http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-27/mcmaster-responds-kushners-russia-back-channel-report)


The general theme of these reports is that McMaster told the press WaPo's Kushner story didn't bother him and has therefore lost all credibility. But that's not what he said:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFE1pdMv4yY

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-kushner-idUSKBN18N0NA
	Reporter: Question for General McMaster--I know you said you didn't want to address this, but you are the National Security Advisor, so, you know, I think we're all wondering why someone who's now a senior administration official would want or need a back-channel to Russia, and from you view what the security concerns are surrounding that, if it's appropriate to set something like that up?

	McMaster: No it's not something that I've in any way been involved with or have any knowledge of.

	Cohn: We--We're not gonna comment on Jared. We're just not gonna comment on it.

	Reporter: General, generally speaking General would you be concerned if somebody on the National Security Council or in this administration were to seek a back-channel communication system with the Russian embassy? And with the Kremlin? Would that generally concern you, not to even address Kushner specifically, but in general terms?

	McMaster: No. I mean we have back-channel communications with a number of countries. So generally speaking, about back-channel communications, what that allows you do to is communicate in a discrete manner. So it doesn't pre-dispose you to any sort of content of the conversation or anything. So no, I would not be concerned about it.

	Reporter: So you're not concerned General? You're not concerned.

McMaster said that generally speaking, (and ignoring all the strange details of the Kushner story), a back-channel between Trump and Russia would not concern him. McMaster implies back-channel communications between states are normal and common, which is correct:


https://muse.jhu.edu/book/12968
	Wanis-St. John takes on the question of whether the complex and often perilous secret negotiations between principal parties prove to be instrumental paths to reconciliation or rather roadblocks that disrupt the process. Using the Palestinian-Israeli peace process as a framework, the author focuses on the uses and misuses of "back channel" negotiations. He discusses how top-level PLO and Israeli government officials have often resorted to secret negotiation channels even when there were designated, acknowledged negotiation teams already at work. Intense scrutiny by the media, pressure from constituents, and the reactions of the public all become severe constraints to the process, causing leaders to seek out such back channels. The impact of these secret talks within the peace process over time has largely been unexplored.


http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2014/02/17/lincoln-peace-conference
	Critics say the U.S. should never negotiate with a country like Iran. But as the Obama administration and other members of the U.N. Security Council resume talks with Tehran this week, a new book argues that negotiations with your enemy can be the best path.

	The book looks back to a secret peace conference during the late stages of the Civil War when President Abraham Lincoln spoke in person with Confederate representatives on the presidential steamboat River Queen, the Air Force One of her day.


http://www.npr.org/2014/10/01/352775195/secret-talks-and-back-channels-pervaded-u-s-relationship-with-cuba
	For five decades, the official U.S. policy on Cuba was one of silence. But the real U.S. relationship with Havana involved secret negotiations that started with President Kennedy in 1963, even after his embargo against the island nation, say the authors of the new book Back Channel to Cuba. In fact, nearly every U.S. administration for the past 50 years has engaged in some sort of dialogue with the Cuban government, they say.


For any President, the back-channel itself isn't interesting, it's what they say that may or may not be concerning. As McMaster pointed out, a back-channel "doesn't pre-dispose you to any sort of content of the conversation or anything."  McMaster, either not knowing or not caring that his words would be used against him, simply answered the question straight.

So one has to wonder, why are media figures attacking him? Even for the few reports that pointed-out he didn't comment on the Kushner story specifically, many or most insinuated McMaster was involved in some kind of conspiracy to cover for Trump (e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/27/trump-adviser-i-would-not-be-concerned-about-a-russia-back-channel-irrespective-of-kushner/). And these reports were once again followed with calls for McMaster to resign:

The sum of all this: it looks like someone's got it out for McMaster. Take how Maggie Haberman and Glen Thrush report on him:


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/white-house-staff.html
	By GLENN THRUSH and MAGGIE HABERMAN  MAY 16, 2017

	...As they struggled to limit the fallout on Monday, Mr. Spicer and other Trump aides decided to send Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, to serve as a surrogate.

	They realized that selecting such a high-ranking official would in some ways validate the story, but they wanted to establish a credible witness account exonerating the president from wrongdoing — before the barrage of Twitter posts they knew would be coming from Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning.

	The White House Counsel’s Office worked with the national security adviser, an Army general, on framing language, producing a clipped sound bite: “The story that came out tonight as reported is false.”

	...In private, three administration officials conceded that they could not publicly articulate their most compelling — and honest — defense of the president for divulging classified intelligence to the Russians: that Mr. Trump, a hasty and indifferent reader of his briefing materials, simply did not possess the interest or the knowledge of the granular details of intelligence gathering to leak specific sources and methods of intelligence gathering that would harm American allies.

	Mr. McMaster all but said that publicly from the briefing room lectern.

	“The president wasn’t even aware where this information came from,” Mr. McMaster said. “He wasn’t briefed on the source or method of the information either.”


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/us/politics/trump-returns-to-crisis-over-kushner-as-white-house-tries-to-contain-it.html
	By MAGGIE HABERMAN, GLENN THRUSH and JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVISMAY 27, 2017 

	...The reports about Mr. Kushner dominated an end-of-trip briefing for reporters in Taormina, Italy, where Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the president’s national security adviser, and Gary D. Cohn, his top economic adviser, declined to comment specifically on Mr. Kushner but sought to play down the significance of the disclosures.

	“We have back-channel communications with any number of countries,” General McMaster said. “So, generally speaking, about back-channel communications, what that allows you to do is to communicate in a discreet manner. It doesn’t predispose you to any kind of content in that conversation.”

	He did not say whether he was comfortable with the idea of a private citizen, as Mr. Kushner was at the time, opening such a back channel.

	Behind the scenes, Mr. Trump’s advisers were working to create a crisis-control communications operation within the White House to separate the Russia investigations and related scandals from the administration’s day-to-day themes and the work of governing, according to several people familiar with their plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to divulge the details of a still-evolving strategy.


Haberman e.t. al report some kind of conspiracy involving McMaster to lie for the President (and also, interestingly, appears to have started the rumor that Trump dislikes McMaster). But anybody who actually watches McMaster's press conferences can see what he is doing: he either doesn't comment or answers the question straight. Apparently, some people have caught-on to this and realized they can use this against him. Haberman and her sources assign a disingenuous motive to McMaster, but her reporting has contradicted sworn testimony before (see https://pastebin.com/LH2D0eqR):


www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/analysis-pence-filling-key-voids-in-trump-white-house/
    By Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman
    The New York Times
 
    ...When Flynn was fired in mid-February, Trump and White House officials said that he had misled the vice president about his conversations with Kislyak, which led to an embarrassing television appearance in which an oblivious Pence defended Flynn’s conduct.
 
    In reality, Trump — convinced by Bannon, Priebus and Kushner — had already decided that Flynn was a liability, and was eager to find an excuse to get rid of him, according to three administration officials familiar with the episode.


It's interesting that Haberman, contradicting the later testimony by Yates, exonerates Trump somewhat by suggesting he didn't have intent to cover for Flynn.

It's also interesting that after Defense Secretary Mattis said he was not "not worried" about Trump's disclosure to the Russians, there was no wide-scale media controversy, little or no attacks on his character, and no calls for his resignation:


https://www.google.com/search?q=Mattis&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A5%2F16%2F2017%2Ccd_max%3A5%2F17%2F2017

Mattis has plenty of his own problems, which could be the subject of its own write-up later, not the least of which include:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukaradeeb_wedding_party_massacre
	USMC Major General James Mattis even said the idea of a wedding was implausible, "How many people go to the middle of the desert ... to hold a wedding 80 miles (130km) from the nearest civilization? These were more than two dozen military-age males. Let's not be naive." The Rakats and the Sabahs were residents of Mukaradeeb. He later added that it had taken him 30 seconds to deliberate on bombing the location.


http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article119255623.html
	Nunes’ intelligence committee chairmanship had already familiarized him with Mattis and Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, a sharp-elbowed retired Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief who Nunes called a “good friend.”

	Prior to Thanksgiving, Nunes recounted, the Trump transition team shared with him the names of potential defense secretary nominees. Nunes suggested the addition of Mattis, the 66-year-old former head of U.S. Central Command.

	“He wasn’t on the (original) list,” Nunes said. “I explained why I thought he would be good, and so they asked me if I would contact him, which I did.”

	Nunes said he e-mailed Mattis, who told him to “call any time.” The two subsequently conversed, and Trump himself talked with Nunes by phone one night about the potential selection. By Nov. 22, Trump told the New York Times that he was “seriously considering” Mattis for the Pentagon job. Trump told a campaign-style rally in Indiana on Dec. 1 that he would nominate the retired four-star general.

	“They say he’s the closest thing to Gen. George Patton that we have,” Trump said.


But Mattis seems to get a pass for doing more or less the same as McMaster. Like the leaking to Russia and secret back-channel stories, Trump's abrasive statements at NATO were a scandal in the media:


http://thehill.com/policy/international/330245-trump-didnt-know-much-about-nato-when-he-called-it-obsolete-report
	04/24/17 

	...“They had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete. But they didn't say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government. People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right?” Trump said to the AP, according to a full transcript published late Sunday.

	“So they asked me, Wolf ... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. ‘NATO's obsolete’ — not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO — NATO is obsolete, and I said, ‘And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism.’ You know, back when they did NATO, there was no such thing as terrorism,” Trump continued.


http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-reiterates-calls-for-nato-members-to-pay-fair-share-defeat-terrorism/
	May 25, 2017

	...Mr. Trump then urged nations to pay their share for defense, and not putting the burden on taxpayers of the United States. 

	"Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States, and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years," he said.

	The president told NATO members that even two percent of GDP falls short.  

	"We should recognize that with these chronic underpayments and growing threats, even 2 percent of GDP is insufficient to close the gaps in modernizing readiness and the size of forces," he said.

	Trump and NATO: A more gracious appeal may have gotten more mileage with the Europeans
 	By Kori Schake Published May 28, 2017


But Mattis later appeared on "Face the Nation" and defended Trump's statements:

	Mattis: Trump’s message on NATO “consistent” with past presidents
	May 27, 2017


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAIUUap3INM
	Dickerson: When the President puts pressure on these NATO members to pay up, is there any worry that might backfire? They might--domestically they don't want to look like they're bowing to the pressure of the American President.

	Mattis: Having been a NATO officer, under President Bush and President Obama, and then having been back there in Brussels representing the Department of Defense under President Trump, that this is a consistent message that we have given the NATO nations, where President Bush wanted them to pay more for the common defense---they get the best defense in the world, the NATO countries. We've all gotta be willing to deal with it like a bank: if you wanna take something out of it, you gotta put something into it.

	President Obama sent the same message to NATO: that they had to pay their fair share. Finally, during President Obama's time, all the nations made a commitment in Wales that they would do that. So what President Trump is doing is consistent with both prior Republican and Democrat Administrations, and the bottom line is that nations are spending more on defense now than they were five years ago or ten years ago.


And unlike McMaster's comments, Mattis' comments are misleading: the controversy isn't about Trump's message, it's about how he said it:


http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2002/s020131a.htm
	BUSH: The United States must have partners who can contribute their fair share to operations which benefit the entire Euro-Atlantic community. This is the best possible way to build on the emotional and practical strengthening of transatlantic bonds caused by the terrible attacks last year.

	The willingness to share the burdens and risks of taking on terrorism of a global reach was clearly evidenced in the offers made to the United States for its military campaign in Afghanistan.


http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-reiterates-calls-for-nato-members-to-pay-fair-share-defeat-terrorism/
	TRUMP: Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States, and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.

	...with these chronic underpayments and growing threats, even 2 percent of GDP is insufficient to close the gaps in modernizing readiness and the size of forces.


This is the damage from Trump's intel disclosures to the Russians:

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-highlights-u-s-ties-after-trump-shares-intel-russia-n760611
	Israel Highlights U.S. Ties After Trump Shares Intel With Russia

	 Israel's defense minister reiterated his country's "deep, significant" ties with the U.S. on Wednesday, a day after it emerged that President Donald Trump had shared highly sensitive Israeli intelligence with Russia.

	"The security relationship between Israel and our greatest ally the United States is deep, significant and unprecedented in volume," Avigdor Liberman wrote in a tweet. 


And this is the damage from Trump's statements at NATO:

http://www.timesofisrael.com/german-fm-trump-has-weakened-the-west-hurt-eu-interests/
	Germany unleashed a volley of criticism Monday against US President Donald Trump, slamming his “short-sighted” policies that have “weakened the West” and hurt European interests. 


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/world/europe/angela-merkel-trump-alliances-g7-leaders.html
	Merkel, After Discordant G-7 Meeting, Is Looking Past Trump

	Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Europe’s most influential leader, has concluded, after three days of trans-Atlantic meetings, that the United States of President Trump is not the reliable partner her country and the Continent have automatically depended on in the past.

	Clearly disappointed with Mr. Trump’s positions on NATO, Russia, climate change and trade, Ms. Merkel said in Munich on Sunday that traditional alliances were no longer as steadfast as they once were and that Europe should pay more attention to its own interests “and really take our fate into our own hands.”


But, as of the time of writing, there are no character attacks on Mattis for defending Trump's statements, nobody calling him a liar, no multi-page op-eds pondering where he lost his way, and certainly no calls for him to resign (although David Frum did attack McMaster for saying Trump supports article 5: https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/05/trump-nato-germany/528429/).

The point of all this is not that it's unfair, it's that it's weird. Why are journalists ignoring logic, accuracy, and consistency to attack the last counter to Russian influence in President Trump's cabinet?Why would any reasonable person interested in keeping Russian influence out of our government want this man to resign?

In U.S. intelligence reports and Congressional hearings, we've heard that Russia used "fake news" to influence the U.S. election, and that these influence operations continue to this day:


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/30/heres-what-we-actually-know-about-russian-election-interference/
	Each of the academic experts at Thursday’s hearing stressed that Russia uses a combination of covert and overt techniques to influence other countries. And Eugene Rumer, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment, said the overt techniques are the ones to which we should really be paying attention.

	“It is the totality of Russian efforts in plain sight — to mislead, to misinform, to exaggerate — that is more convincing than any cyber evidence. RT, Internet trolls, fake news and so on, are an integral part of Russian foreign policy today,” Rumer said.

	By their nature, Russian influence campaigns are multifaceted and designed to be deniable because they use a mix of agents of influence, cutouts, front organizations, and false-flag operations. Moscow demonstrated this during the Ukraine crisis in 2014, when Russia deployed forces and advisers to eastern Ukraine and denied it publicly.

	...During the Cold War, the Soviet Union used intelligence officers, influence agents, forgeries, and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the Kremlin, according to a former KGB archivist.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/
	HECK: ...We've also heard how Russia released disinformation to spread rumors and confused the public and to sow distrust and the ability to even know truth objectively, using propaganda, media outlets, whether they're owned directly by Russia or not, to release such disinformation in order to claim plausible deniability of Russia's hands.


But fake news doesn't all come from trolls in the KGB's basement--somebody has to actually write this news. Sometimes, they are easy to spot:

	Let’s Make Russia Our Sister Country!

	Ann Coulter, American Renaissance, March 15, 2017

	Have you guys heard of the Evil Empire? Now Democrats are hypersensitive to a Russian leader’s flaws?

	Liberals were cool with the show trials, the alliance with Hitler, the gulags, the forced starvations, the shooting down of American planes and goose-stepping through Eastern Europe.

	But that was when the Russian leader was Joseph Stalin or Nikita Khrushchev — not the beast Putin!

	...That’s how liberals became born-again John Birchers, seeing Russians under every bed. Now, no fear of Russia is inordinate. The Russians do NOT love their children, too.

	We really could have used some of this fighting spirit about 50 years ago when the Soviet Union sought total world domination and Stalin’s spies were crawling through the U.S. government. 


Other times, it's not that easy. Russian intelligence takes their "active measures" very seriously, and they have made extensive use of press placements for more than century:


https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/okhrana-the-paris-operations-of-the-russian-imperial-police/5474-1.html
	Harting's case officer was Pyotr Rachkovsky, probably the ablest head of the Okhrana's Foreign Bureau. Rachkovsky was a pioneer. He refined the art of what we today call active measures or perceptions management techniques. He paid subsidies to journalists willing to write articles favorable to Russian interests, and he purchased or subsidized such periodicals as Revue Russe and Le Courier Franco-Russe. During his tenure (1884-1902), journalists on the Okhrana payroll began planting articles in the French press that were favorable to Russian interests.


https://www.gwern.net/docs/terrorism/1989-andrew.pdf
	Like much else in the study of contemporary intelligence, KGB and GRU foreign operations are commonly interpreted with almost total disregard for historical perspective. "Active measures" are widely believed to be an invention of Soviet intelligence. In reality, though the KGB has been responsible for an enormous expansion in the use made of them, their effectiveness was at least as great in tsarist times. There is no convincing evidence that any KGB-inspired press campaign in the West as been as effective as the tsarist attempting to persuade Western investors, all of whom later lost their money, to ignore the risks of investing in Russia. Before World War I, every Paris newspaper of note save for the socialist L'Humanite was successfully bribed to support tsarist government loans. By 1914, 25 percent of France's foreign investment was in Russia


https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP86T00586R000400490007-7.pdf
	The Soviets enjoy nearly unfettered access to the pages of Indian newspapers, largely through the efforts of the Soviet Information Department. ...Moscow overtly and covertly placed more than 160,000 items (original articles plus replays) in the Indian press, widely regarded as the freest in the Third World. Access to Press Trust of India, the largest English language news service, has become so automatic that some Soviet officials have come to call it "Press TASS of India."


Maj. Stephanie Whittle does a good job of explaining more about what active measures is and how recruiting journalists plays into it:

https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=768335
	In a 1998 CNN interview, retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin described active measures as
		the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence. . . . Not intelligence collection, but subversion; active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO; to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs.

	...U.S. joint doctrine defines subversion as “actions designed to undermine the military, economic, psychological, or political strength or morale of a governing authority.” The Soviets simply defined subversion as the strategy of “conquest from within.”

	...Classic Active Measures:
	Press Placements

	In open societies covert press placements by the Soviets and their surrogates were usually difficult to identify, but sometimes the topic of a particular article or news story could provide clues that the talking points were consistent with active measures objectives.

	...In the West, covert action is normally entrusted to the state’s regular intelligence service and kept separate from other spheres of governmental or private activity. In the Soviet case, many active measures were planned and executed by intelligence operatives, but such measures were also conducted by party and government officials and by many nominally unofficial persons such as journalists, academics, and representatives of “public” organizations. The common thread that runs through all active measures is a high degree of emphasis on concealing Soviet involvement and the real purpose behind an activity in which a Soviet threat was overtly involved.

	...Political influence operations were arguably the most important but least understood aspect of Soviet active measures: “ They are difficult to trace and to deal with because they fall in the gray area between a legitimate exchange of ideas and an active measures operation.” They included exploitation of “agents of influence” and unwitting contacts in order to “insinuate the official voice of the Soviet Union into foreign governmental, political, journalistic, business, labor, artistic, and academic circles in a non-attributable or at least seemingly unofficial matter. KGB influence networks depended on developing strong personal relationships with political, economic, and media figures in the West and the Third World:

		The main objective of an influence operation is the use of the agent’s position—be it in government, politics, labor, journalism, or some other field—to support and promote political conditions desired by the sponsoring foreign power. This operation is one element of a carefully orchestrated effort: “kombinatsia” = the skill of relating, linking, and combining various agents of influence (at various times in various places) with special operational undertakings, in such a way as to enhance effectiveness. The first phase entails development of strong covert personal relationships with important figures in foreign societies. Next step is to secure active collaboration of the individual on matters of mutual interest (money, assistance in achievement of political or personal goals).

	The agent of influence aspect of active measures may have been the most complex and the least documented. Godson and Shultz note that “even skilled counterintelligence find it very difficult to follow and unravel orchestrated agent-of-influence operations.” An ideal agent of influence could be an established journalist, a government official, labor leader, academic, opinion leader, artist, or involved in one of a number of other professions—an authority with a credible reputation, whose opinions others would take “at face value.”

	...Use of the Media 

	Many KGB officers served abroad under “journalistic cover,” which was especially advantageous for influence purposes because these positions provided access to a “wider range of influential individuals than diplomats or other officials usually had.” Ladislav Bittman, a former Czech intelligence officer, emphasized that news pieces produced in these cases did not underscore support for Soviet policy, but instead concentrated on “undermining the United States and NATO, and on creating rifts between West Germany and France or between the United States and its allies.” Oftentimes a KGB handler would provide guidelines for an agent of influence in the media to follow, typically “two or three pages outline of objectives and themes to be covered in a given article.” All agents, including journalists, were either wittingly or unwittingly used for intelligence collection, purposes, as they often had access to strategically significant confidential in formation.

	Lunev also summarized other political influence efforts through alternative channels, beginning in the early years of the Stalin regime:  

		Through my KGB and GRU contacts, I heard many stories of how Stalin and other leaders initiated many long-term efforts to undermine American society. Their main effort was to increase violence inside the United States, and their effort included paying selected Hollywood producers to produce violent and offensive films. The Soviet Union also provided financial support to the most aggressive and violent minority leaders. The Soviet Union always supported “agents of influence” who could either sway people to the Soviet point of view or cause general turmoil in the United States.


As Maj. Whittle points out, Russian intelligence operates differently from how most people might think an spy agency operates. They put a far greater emphasis on influence operations than intelligence gathering, for one. And instead of sitting in the Kremlin and writing propaganda articles themselves, Russian intelligence recruits Americans to do it for them. American journalists have long been a target of their recruiting: you can find about 70 listed here, for example: http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page66.html#_ftn3

Russia has an active roster of journalists reporting the news writing opinion pieces the way the Kremlin wants it. For them, it is a part of how they wage war:


http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-09/russia-propaganda-eastern-ukraine-separatists-e-mails/seite-3
	Some journalists find it exciting not to remain neutral in their reporting, but to become involved in psychological warfare instead, says Dmitri R., who worked as an independent journalist in eastern Ukraine and was supposed to become a propagandist. He worked for Newsfront, the channel associated with the rebels. He quit his job when he realized how the regime was exploiting journalists. He is unwilling to use his real name, fearing reprisals. When asked how free he was to report on events in the eastern Ukraine war zone, Dmitri R. laughs bitterly: "Whenever I asked if I could use the material to record material independently, I was always given the same answer: This is not the time for journalism. Journalism is something for peace. For the war, which is also an information war, we need information soldiers. We truly regarded ourselves as information soldiers. And it made the work seem very special."


For the Kremlin, this is an old game. You shouldn't expect every Russian propagandists to be signing praises of Putin or calling for the dissolution of NATO. There is obvious value in recruiting journalists that are harder to detect than that, and Russian intelligence knows this. They also know that U.S. media will inevitably be covering Trump's Russia scandals, and that while it is all but impossible to bury them, it is possible to influence how his scandals are reported. Disparaging Russia or badmouthing Trump doesn't free a journalist of suspicion of being a Russian propagandist.

But there will always be a way to test if a journalist or any kind of agent of influence is working for the Kremlin: if they lie, misrepresent the facts, contradict themselves, act inconsistently, take an unusual risk, or otherwise go out of their way to act in a way that benefits the Kremlin's interests. In early 20th century France, propagandists in the French media convinced investors to place their money in Russia, despite the risks. For the McMaster case, it is all but certain the Kremlin would want McMaster, probably the last bulwark against Russian influence in the NSC, out of the White House. And the journalists and media figures who attacked him and called for his resignation certainly went out of their way to do so, leaving behind accuracy, consistency, and common-sense logic. One should take seriously the possibility that these people misrepresented the facts around McMaster's comments for a reason, and that this reason could be for the benefit of a foreign power.

Even famous journalists have been caught working for Russian intelligence:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._F._Stone#Allegations_revisited
	In the Cold War history, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America (2000), John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr said that I. F. Stone was the Soviet secret agent BLIN. They cited four Venona cables that mentioned the American journalist I. F. Stone, and that two of the cables contained evidence of Stone's pro–Soviet espionage. That the files of the KGB, from 1936 to 1939, indicate that Stone was a Soviet secret agent, who worked as a talent spotter, as a courier to other secret agents, and that he provided private and journalistic information to KGB. That Stone collaborated with the Communist Victor Perlo group, who gave him materials for use in journalistic exposés.

	...In Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America (2009), Klehr, Haynes, and Alexander Vassiliev, formerly of KGB, cite a KGB file [which Vassiliev saw in the Soviet Union] that named "Isidor Feinstein, a commentator for the New York Post" in the 1930s, as being secret agent BLIN, who "entered the channel of normal operational work" in 1936. That a note listed BLIN as an agent of the KGB station in New York City, in 1938. Klehr, Haynes, and Vassiliev said that Stone "assisted Soviet intelligence on a number of tasks, ranging from doing some talent spotting, acting as a courier, by relaying information to other agents, and providing private journalist tidbits and data [that] the KGB found interesting".


So, unfortunately for her, Maggie Haberman can't escape suspicion of being on the Kremlin's payroll either, despite her reputation.

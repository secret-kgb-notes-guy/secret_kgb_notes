Probably the best case that can be made that Gorsuch is a Russian agent comes from considering their motives and their capabilities: if Russia could get a sleeper agent appointed to the Supreme Court, why wouldn't they?

It does look like Russia has agents with credentials and expertise of Gorsuch's caliber, such as Jack Goldsmith, Henry Kissinger, possibly Donald McGahn, and some of the Americans listed in the Venona Papers or Mitrokhin Archives:

Otherwise, there are a few indirect hints that Gorsuch could be a Russian agent, particularly in they way he was chosen for SCOTUS and his family history.

The Kremlin has an interest in U.S. think tanks and public policy, and some members of the Heritage Foundation, including their President Jim DeMint, have acted in ways to help the Kremlin, knowingly or otherwise:

Heritage lawyer John Malcolm helped Trump pick Judge Gorsuch. But, like the Kremlin, both Malcolm and DeMint have been fanning the flames of partisan conflict over judicial nominees:


http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/full-transcript-johh-malcolm-234353
	MALCOLM: You know, it’s very, very hard to say. Obviously, the confirmation process, I don’t think is pleasing at this point to anybody. So if you’re a person on the left, you’re going to look and say, “Oh, my God. Wasn’t this a horrible thing. And Merrick Garland’s a fine judge.” And he is a fine judge, by the way, and a fine human being. “And isn’t this terrible that the Republicans did this?”

	Republicans have a somewhat different perspective. I mean, this all started in terms of politicizing the court, from the perspective of the right, with the nomination of Robert Bork, and has continued through Clarence Thomas, the filibustering of Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, and others. There was no great love lost between the Republican side of the Senate, and the Democratic side and President Obama.

	In November of 2013, Harry Reid exercised this so-called “nuclear option.” He did it for one purpose, and that was to pack the second most important court in the land, the D.C. Circuit, and get three judges appointed. So that if push came to shove on controversial issues, the court could take the issue en banc, and would more likely rule in favor of the administration.

	I would also note, and perhaps, it was Judge Garland, or Chief Judge Garland who was caught as a pawn in a chess game that was not of his own making. But there’s a history there. Then Senator Joe Biden, a year-and-a-half—it might have been a year—to go in the George H. W. Bush administration, said, “Hey, this is an election year. If there is a vacancy, the Senate will not confirm anybody whom you send up.”

	And then, about a year-and-a-half to go, into the administration of George W. Bush, Harry Reid said the same thing. He said, “If there is a vacancy, we will not confirm.” So there—[OVERLAPPING]

	DOVERE: The idea that this was politicized, or dysfunctional anymore in 2016, to you, is not really compelling? We’re already down that road?

	MALCOLM: Well, we were well down that road. 

	DOVERE: But you don’t think it did anything to harm the institution more than it—again, more than the harm that had been done already?

	MALCOLM: Look, I think the Supreme Court confirmation process has, for better or worse, become politicized. In terms of damaging the court, no. The court continued to do its business. It picked a few controversial cases this year, that were likely to divide the court. They only evenly divided on a small number. They will get a new colleague up there in the not-too-distant future. Any issues that they really want to decide again, they can hold over for re-argument.

	So the court muddled through and appeared to do quite well. And I guess my feeling is, is that at the end of the day, it is far more important to get a good constitutionalist justice up there than to rush the process and get up somebody who may not be up to snuff. And that’s not to imply that Merrick Garland wouldn’t have been up to snuff.

	DOVERE: He just wouldn’t have made your list?

	MALCOLM: Yeah.

	DOVERE: [LAUGHS]

	MALCOLM: No. He would not have made my list. But look, he’s a fine man. He was a fine man before he became a judge, and he’s a fine man as a judge, and he’s a dedicated public servant. And so, you know, I wish him well.


http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/317342-political-grandstanding-cant-discredit-judge-gorsuchs-record
	Yet today, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., insists that “The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, …(g)iven his record, I have very serious doubts about (his) ability to meet this standard.”

	Indeed, more than a few liberal senators declared their intention to filibuster President Trump’s nominee days before they even knew who that nominee would be! As Senator Ben Sasse, R-N.E., noted on a visit to the Supreme Court last night, protestors even had “fill-in-the-blank” signs.

	That’s not assessing a nominee according to his or her legal expertise, work experience or even general fitness for office; that’s political grandstanding and manufactured outrage. The only consideration should be whether a Supreme Court justice will be faithful to the Constitution.

Neil Gorsuch's mother, Anne Gorsuch, at least fits the mold of a Russian influence agent.

Anne Gorsuch's misconduct as head of the EPA caused a major scandal:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Gorsuch_Burford


Controversial journalist James J. Kilpatrick defended Anne Gorsuch and helped politicize the scandal:

https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19820417&id=msJaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZlkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6948,470739


Causing government scandals and politicizing them seems to be a Russian tactic, perhaps as a way to increase partisan conflict and animosity. The Russians might also have wanted to create scandals as a way to hurt Reagan's Administration.

And Kilpatrick also fits the mold of a Russian influence agent, as he played a major role in politicizing desegregation and stoking racial conflict:

At the time, the KGB was interested in exploiting the Civil Rights movement to cause a race war: https://medium.com/@bb06/ideological-subversion-and-racism-f3d09421cf78

Today, Russian propagandists are still interested in Killpatrick:

Anne Gorsuch also promoted the ideology of "New Federalism:" 

https://web.archive.org/web/20020620020957/http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/epa/15e.htm
	It should be remembered that I came to office as part of a new Administration that brought a different approach to solving the problems of government. One of the tenets of that approach was what we called New Federalism, or the idea that thee were any number of services being provided by Uncle Sam that could be better provided by the states themselves. Under that theory, while at EPA, we were the only agency in Washington that was truly practicing New Federalism. The amount of delegation we accomplished in 22 months was truly enormous. And with each delegation we increased the manpower in the country dedicated to environmental protection.

Most Russian propagandists that have been identified so far will have an ideology they want to promote and stick to it. You can see this today with Russian propagandists promoting racism, fear of muslims, anger against the police, and even still promoting communism. Efforts to promote an ideology that favors the Kremlin is a sign that someone is a Russian influence agent, although obviously such behavior isn't conclusive proof.

New Federalism revived the Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist debate, which strained the U.S. at it's birth and was a centerpiece of the Civil War.

Russian propagandists appear to recognize the divisive power of this debate:

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-24/buchanan-secession-solution-cultural-war
https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Afreedomoutpost.com+federalism


New Federalism was first promoted by Nixon. It's hard to say if New Federalism was a Russian project, although it would be in line with their methods of wielding ideology as a weapon to promote conflict.

Since Russian illegals are known to recruit their children a high-value spies, Anne Gorsuch being a Russian illegal would bolster the case that Neil Gorsuch is likewise a Russian illegal.

------

Overall, the indications that Gorsuch is a Russian agent are mostly faint. The analysis of Russia's capabilities and motives is probably the best reason to be concerned. But it doesn't look like there is any "smoking gun" here. At this point, it's simply hard to say for sure whether or not Gorsuch is a Russian agent.

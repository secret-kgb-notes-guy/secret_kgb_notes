Russia has a large network of deep-cover spies and agents of influence (the "illegals program," see https://pastebin.com/NjfhJTky and https://pastebin.com/8vtBnsuN). Unsurprisingly, Russia has been trying to make it harder for U.S. intelligence agencies to catch them, using active measures to try to change our surveillance laws. Trump's "wiretapping" tweets have helped them bring a fake illegal wiretapping scandal to the right:

	Snowden Helped Reduce Surveillance and Strengthen Resistance: Report

	Audit from the Department of Justice inspector general finds 2013 revelations attached 'stigma' to data collection requests

	...However, there may be other circumstances factoring into the drop, as the government turns increasingly toward other provisions like Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to sweep up information. Section 702 allows the government to collect emails and other international electronic information as long as no U.S. citizen is specifically targeted.

	The court’s mandate has expanded exponentially since 1978, especially during the 90s. More recently, Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act—both of which were passed decades after the initial FISA—granted far broader spying authorities to the government than had existed before, and the government has claimed the right to conduct mass surveillance under these provisions.

	The Problem of Our Surveillance Laws: Report Exposes Deeply Rooted Governmental Secrecy—Underscoring Why Obama Should Act Now

	...Information about the scope of government surveillance of U.S. persons under Section 702 of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act (FAA). The U.S. government relies upon Section 702 as the statutory basis for its PRISM and Upstream mass surveillance programs. These programs sweep up data on hundreds of millions of people who have no connection to terrorist investigations, including countless Americans.

	Word Games: What the NSA Means by ‘Targeted’ Surveillance Under Section 702

	It is completely correct to characterize Section 702 as mass surveillance

	...This word game is important because Section 702 is set to expire in December 2017. EFF and our colleagues who banded together to stop the Section 215 telephone records surveillance are gathering our strength for this next step in reining in the NSA. At the same time, the government spin doctors are trying to avoid careful examination by convincing Congress and the American people that this is just “targeted” surveillance and doesn’t impact innocent people.

	Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!


https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/837993273679560704
	Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!


https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/837994257566863360
	I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!


https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/837996746236182529
	How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!

	Trump Wiretapping ‘A Scandal Bigger Than Watergate’ Roger Stone Tells RT

	...He believes, and I believe, that he was under surveillance by the federal government and the intelligence agencies while he was the Republican nominee for president. This is a scandal bigger than Watergate. This is the most outrageous breach of law and of morality in American public history.

	The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?


http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/10/republicans-mull-over-whether-to-reauthorize-key-fisa-amendments/
	WASHINGTON — Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) amendments expire at the end of the year unless Congress votes to reauthorize them — but some members are unsure if that should happen.

	The deadline comes amid the House and Senate Intelligence Committees’ investigation into Russian influence peddling in the 2016 election.

	FISA gives the legal structure that enables the government to amass foreign intelligence material via physical searches, wiretapping and other search techniques.

	House Judiciary Committee members met last week to discuss the fate of Section 702,  a key provision of the FISA Amendments Act that sets up legal protocols for federal law enforcement to follow when collecting intercepts of individuals off U.S. soil for foreign monitoring intents.

	One Judiciary Committee member, Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, told The Daily Caller Thursday night his concern about the recent behavior of the intelligence community in relation to the sensitive leaks about the activities of the Trump administration. Gohmert pointed to the unmasking of General Michael Flynn’s name in wiretap that was leaked to the press.

	Unclassified Documents Show Obama Intel Agency Secretly Spied On Americans For Years
	
	The National Security Agency under former President Barack Obama routinely violated American privacy protections while scouring through overseas intercepts and failed to disclose the extent of the problems until the final days before Donald Trump was elected president last fall, according to once top-secret documents that chronicle some of the most serious constitutional abuses to date by the U.S. intelligence community.

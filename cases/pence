	A White House spokesman confirmed Pence's meeting with Hilarion and said the cleric's comments also reflected President Trump's views. Hilarion says that after talking with Pence, he feels “very positive” about the future of the relationship between the U.S. and Russia.

	Mr. Pence’s team has at times questioned whether Mr. Priebus was up to the demands of his job, according to one West Wing official close to the vice president, who was not authorized to discuss private interactions involving Mr. Pence. And Mr. Trump has made his own unhappiness known with Mr. Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

	Mr. Pence’s communications director, Jarrod Agen, insisted that it was “categorically untrue for anyone to suggest that Reince has anything but the full support” of the vice president.

What's going on here?

	And he professed ignorance of Mr. Flynn’s paid work for the Turkish government during the campaign, even though Mr. Cummings had written him a letter pointing out the potential conflict of interest during the transition.


hmmm, trying to drag Pence into a scandal?

	It’s clear that Mr. Pence knew Mr. Christie was in trouble — but it’s still unclear if he knew the ax would fall that day. Yet Mr. Pence’s dad-in-the-Norman Rockwell-painting demeanor masks a shrewd political intelligence, and he is often willing to play whatever role is required of him.

Suggesting some sort of conspiracy with Pence grabbing power in transition team?

	Mr. Pence was a lot less upset about how the episode was publicly portrayed — and happily provided the president and his staff with a plausible explanation for getting rid of Mr. Flynn, the officials said, even though it made the vice president appear out of touch.

suggesting Pence knew what was going on, lying?

	Both men have tried to nudge the president to the right, and pressed Mr. Trump to make serious concessions to the Freedom Caucus over health care, advocating an accelerated timetable for phasing out Medicaid at the behest of Republican governors.

	Mr. Pence was a steady advocate, if ultimately not a successful one, during Mr. Trump’s last-minute push, telling hard-liners as part of his pitch that “I would have been a member of the Freedom Caucus if I was still in Congress.”


Saying Pence and Bannon wanted Trump to make healthcare worse

	When that didn’t work, he joined Mr. Bannon in pushing for a vote — to identify and shame dissenters — even as the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, urged the president to think less about revenge than about stockpiling political capital for coming fights on the budget, tax reform and an infrastructure bill.

	But Mr. Pence refused to concede defeat.

	When Mr. Ryan called the White House at 3 p.m. on Friday, announcing that he didn’t have the votes to pass the health care bill, the vice president asked Mr. Trump for “another 10 minutes” to double-check Mr. Ryan’s vote count.

	After making a couple of calls, he conceded, “It’s over.”

	So, for instance - and I was thinking about this a lot yesterday - when he was choosing his vice president back in the summer of 2016, he had very clearly, quote, unquote, "settled" on Mike Pence and decided that's where he was going. That's where Paul Manafort, his then-campaign chairman wanted him to go. It's where a lot of people wanted him to go. But he literally until the last possible second was questioning whether he had made the right decision right before the announcement. And he did, by my reporting, have a last minute, you know, should I pick Chris Christie, and then did not.

	But a couple of people who I spoke to - and who my colleague, Alex Burns, who I did most of that race with spoke to - said at the time when we would ask about but didn't he say, you know, am I making the right decision, is this the right move? And two very close advisers to him told us that is just how he talks. One of them said to me, you know, how many times have you spoken to Donald Trump?

	And I, you know, I've spoken to him countless times. I've - I covered him at the New York tabloids. And the person said how many times has he asked you your opinion of whether he has made the right decision on something? And the answer was a lot. And so this is a stylistic tic with him as much as it is anything else.


Haberman likes to point out that Trump was unsure about Pence and Manafort pushed him to pick him

	He trusts that Mike Pence has his best interests at heart. He does not believe that Mike Pence is doing anything to undermine him. And for Trump, that is enormously important. I mean, for Pence, who's a former congressman, explaining to people on the Hill what the Trump policy endeavors are going to be and how this president will approach them is of huge importance.

Is that true? interesting. Although then why was Trump "unsure" about picking Pence?

	Pence is, for lack of a better - I don't want to say malleable because that suggests a lack of core beliefs in a way that I don't mean it, but I do think that Pence, for somebody who is a pretty dyed-in-the-wool conservative, can be willing to take a seemingly contrary stance when it suits him. I think for Trump, it's, frankly, less of a contradiction. You know, he's a novice politician who needed help balancing the ticket, and he needed somebody who wasn't going to overshadow him. His two other true - three options at the time, one was Mike Flynn, who crashed and burned during a road test on a Sunday show with ABC - which was probably for the best Given everything we know now - one was Newt Gingrich and one was Chris Christie. And in both cases but particularly with Newt - and I enjoy covering Newt Gingrich a great deal - but one of the Trump advisers said to me at the time, if we pair them up, they will end up fighting with each other by the end of the campaign. And Pence is never going to overshadow Trump, and he has no illusions about who is at the top, and that's very important for Trump.

Talks about how Flynn got cut-out by the "road test" on abortion... interesting

Also incinuations of Pence vying for power

	HABERMAN: Yes. And when - yes, it is hard to imagine that. And yet, it actually has worked. It's funny because when he was first getting to know Pence during that summer of 2016, and they really didn't know each other at all, they were actually first introduced by Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, who had been in charge of the Republican Governors Association, and knew Pence that way. And he made the introduction, got them together at a meeting during the Indiana primary, which was the last significant one of the Republican presidential race of 2016.

says Christie introduced Pence and Trump (true?)

	But Pence very quickly melded himself into being a Trump person. Pence has long harbored national ambitions of his own and has always seemed not quite able to get there. And so for Pence's advisers, when he signed on with Trump - and to be clear, this was well before the "Access Hollywood" tape that you were referring to - they took this as a high risk, high reward gamble.

Accusing Pence of deception

	GROSS: ...Trump has said some very insulting things about you on Twitter, calling you sad and third rate and, you know, criticizing you for just being wrong. And yet, he calls you and he gives you scoops. I mean, he called you right before deciding to pull the plug on repeal and replace of Obamacare to give you a heads up about that. You know, you've interviewed him a bunch of times. It seems very contradictory that he'd be so publicly critical of you and then seek you out in the way that he does.

a good point...

Haberman gets defensive

	And to be clear, when I spoke to him the day of the AHCA legislation being yanked, I had asked earlier in the day to speak to him that afternoon. I didn't know they were going to pull the bill at that point but I had asked to talk to him. When I have spoken to him, it's because I have asked for these interviews. I asked to talk to him for a story about how he was adjusting to White House life.

Why mention this?

	But behind the scenes, Mr. Pence and his team of loyalists are waging an equally challenging campaign, hoping to position him as a compelling national politician for a post-2016 landscape. Even if the Republican ticket fails in the battle for the White House, Mr. Pence wants to preserve his future viability, a goal that has created a delicate dance for him — leaving him wary of offending Mr. Trump and his base, while also eager to ingratiate himself with the Republican establishment.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/donald-trump-vice-president.html
	Beyond the question of gender balance, there is also the matter of what exactly Mr. Trump wants to communicate with his pick. If he is looking for someone who can go on the attack against Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, then Mr. Christie and Mr. Gingrich appear to be his best options.

	If he wants someone with military experience, there is Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, who is a veteran, although it is not clear that she would be interested.

Not such great picks Maggie...


	Mr. Trump’s three oldest children, who have served as his closest advisers throughout the campaign, do not have a favored candidate on the list, according to people familiar with their thinking. Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared, an influential figure in the campaign, is said to be playing a role in the process, although the scope of his input is unclear.

	The vetting of potential candidates is being overseen by Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., a Washington lawyer and former White House counsel to President Reagan. Mr. Culvahouse has performed a similar role for Republican nominees since 1976, including for Senator John McCain in 2008, when he recommended Sarah Palin, then the relatively unknown governor of Alaska.


Saying shady people involved in who to pick

	Correction: July 2, 2016
	An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated when Donald J. Trump met with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a potential running mate for Mr. Trump. The meeting took place Saturday, after the article’s publication; it did not take place Friday. 

What how did they know the future...?

	The piece—in which Karen Pence is described by friends and aides as a "warrior" of prayer—adds context to some of the easy-to-mock shit we knew about the couple. Mike Pence told the Hill way back in 2002, for example, that he never eats alone with a woman other than Karen. Additionally, Mike Pence does not attend alcohol-assisted events without Karen.

	“It certainly does slow down the transition’s progress,” one source inside the transition team said.

	It also means it will be tougher for Pence, now leading the transition effort, to deliver on one aide’s promise that the landing teams would arrive at federal agencies “imminently” — even as early as Friday, and it’s another sign of discord in a transition effort that, according to multiple reports, is struggling for stability.

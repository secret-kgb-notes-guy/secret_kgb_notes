	Trump’s political adviser, Roger Stone, said it’s unlikely Trump would release his tax returns – as many presidential candidates do in the spirit of full disclosure – to verify Trump’s worth.

	Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do --everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.

	If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!


every time he mentions Russia its like he has to say "or any other country"


like "In Moscow, Russia (or any other country)..."

	The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me


Trump believes Putin likes him

but has Trump considered Putin likes him sooo much that he would rig the election, just for him?

	WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn told President Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case.

	Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Mr. Flynn of the inquiry, Mr. Trump made Mr. Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Mr. Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by American intelligence agencies.


hmmm, made to his lawyer? is that a problem where attorney-client privilege means you can never figure out for sure in a court? or is it different for WH counsel?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Counsel
	Although the White House Counsel offers legal advice to the President, the Counsel does so in the President's official capacity, and does not serve as the President's personal attorney. Therefore, controversy has emerged over the scope of the attorney–client privilege between the Counsel and the President, namely with John Dean of Watergate notoriety. 


hmmm

	Yesterday, on the same day- I had meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the FM of Ukraine, Pavlo Klimkin. #LetsMakePeace!

Can the "master dealmaker do it?" can he "make peace?" between Ukraine and Russia?

probably not, unless the Russians want him to and set it up for him to prove some sort of point

	PIRRO: Will you be able to work with Schumer after all the horrible things he said about you?

	TRUMP: It's pretty tough to work with him. I am surprised because I have known him for a long time.

	PIRRO: Right.

	TRUMP: Again, he's gone very, very far left. He doesn't have good control of his party, he's not a good leader. And I think it's going to be pretty tough for me to work with him. We'll see. Hopefully what will happen is in `18, we'll going to elect some Republican senators, because we only have a margin of two. We'll going to elect some people, some more Republicans and we will be able to do it without having to go through that situation with Schumer. Because honestly, they just want to stop things, they want to clog up the wheels. And we can't let that happen.


Trump a falling out with Schumer? known him for a long time, perhaps feels betrayed?

 	FBI Director James Comey to stay on in Trump administration

	By Matt Zapotosky, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller January 24

	...The news that Comey would stay in place became public Tuesday, some time after he began informing senior FBI officials around the country that he had been asked to continue.

	Under normal circumstances, the revelation might have been unsurprising: Comey is less than four years into a 10-year term, and it is extremely rare for a president to remove an FBI director. But President Trump had notably declined to say whether he would keep the FBI director, telling “60 Minutes” in an interview after his election that he wanted to meet with Comey first.

	HOLT: Was it in a phone call? Did you meet face to face?

	TRUMP: I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House...

	HOLT: He -- he asked...

	(CROSSTALK)

	TRUMP: ...very early on. That dinner was arranged. I think he asked for the dinner.

	And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I'll, you know, consider. We'll see what happens.


oh wow

does Trump think Comey is talking to him through the Washington post?

	FBI Director James Comey said on Oct. 28 the agency was reviewing emails that might be relevant to a previous inquiry into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, then announced on Nov. 6 that the fresh review had yielded nothing to change the agency's finding that she was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing.

	"What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had, she should never have been allowed to run - guilty as hell," Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday.


hmmm

Would Trump know about the Flynn Clinton email thing?

HOLT: Did you know that he had had -- that received payments from the Russian government? That he had...

TRUMP: No.

HOLT: ...received payments from the Turkish government?

TRUMP: No, but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration. And his -- and -- and this is something they never want to report.

He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have. And I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.

You know, you're talking about 2015. I don't know that I knew him in 2015.


Maybe important to keep in mind:

Trump doesn't actually care about Flynn

Trump only cares about himself.


Even defending Flynn would be just to make himself look better, make it look like he didn't make a mistake

took him off VP shortlist after Flynn flubbed abortion question

fired him when keeping him on made him look bad


why not fire him earlier? could have figured it would be an admission of guilt in a way, an admission that he did at least something wrong--was already in the news Flynn was under investigation.

	"The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story ... I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration."


What is Trump even thinking here? "Flynn is a great guy--but can you believe Obama hired him?"

Pointing this out doesn't help Flynn--it helps himself.

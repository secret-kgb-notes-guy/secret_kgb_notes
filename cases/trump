https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-national-security-adviser.html
	WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn told President Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case.

	Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Mr. Flynn of the inquiry, Mr. Trump made Mr. Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Mr. Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by American intelligence agencies.


hmmm, made to his lawyer? is that a problem where attorney-client privilege means you can never figure out for sure in a court? or is it different for WH counsel?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Counsel
	Although the White House Counsel offers legal advice to the President, the Counsel does so in the President's official capacity, and does not serve as the President's personal attorney. Therefore, controversy has emerged over the scope of the attorney–client privilege between the Counsel and the President, namely with John Dean of Watergate notoriety.

	PIRRO: Will you be able to work with Schumer after all the horrible things he said about you?

	TRUMP: It's pretty tough to work with him. I am surprised because I have known him for a long time.

	PIRRO: Right.

	TRUMP: Again, he's gone very, very far left. He doesn't have good control of his party, he's not a good leader. And I think it's going to be pretty tough for me to work with him. We'll see. Hopefully what will happen is in `18, we'll going to elect some Republican senators, because we only have a margin of two. We'll going to elect some people, some more Republicans and we will be able to do it without having to go through that situation with Schumer. Because honestly, they just want to stop things, they want to clog up the wheels. And we can't let that happen.


Trump a falling out with Schumer? known him for a long time, perhaps feels betrayed?

 	FBI Director James Comey to stay on in Trump administration

	By Matt Zapotosky, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller January 24

	...The news that Comey would stay in place became public Tuesday, some time after he began informing senior FBI officials around the country that he had been asked to continue.

	Under normal circumstances, the revelation might have been unsurprising: Comey is less than four years into a 10-year term, and it is extremely rare for a president to remove an FBI director. But President Trump had notably declined to say whether he would keep the FBI director, telling “60 Minutes” in an interview after his election that he wanted to meet with Comey first. 


https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
	HOLT: Was it in a phone call? Did you meet face to face?

	TRUMP: I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House...

	HOLT: He -- he asked...

	(CROSSTALK)

	TRUMP: ...very early on. That dinner was arranged. I think he asked for the dinner.

	And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I'll, you know, consider. We'll see what happens.


oh wow

does Trump think Comey is talking to him through the Washington post?


------


http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-idUSKBN14X1FZ
	FBI Director James Comey said on Oct. 28 the agency was reviewing emails that might be relevant to a previous inquiry into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, then announced on Nov. 6 that the fresh review had yielded nothing to change the agency's finding that she was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing.

	"What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had, she should never have been allowed to run - guilty as hell," Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday.


hmmm

Would Trump know about the Flynn Clinton email thing?


------

https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: Did you know that he had had -- that received payments from the Russian government? That he had...

TRUMP: No.

HOLT: ...received payments from the Turkish government?

TRUMP: No, but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration. And his -- and -- and this is something they never want to report.

He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have. And I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.

You know, you're talking about 2015. I don't know that I knew him in 2015.


Maybe important to keep in mind:

Trump doesn't actually care about Flynn

Trump only cares about himself.


Even defending Flynn would be just to make himself look better, make it look like he didn't make a mistake

took him off VP shortlist after Flynn flubbed abortion question

fired him when keeping him on made him look bad


why not fire him earlier? could have figured it would be an admission of guilt in a way, an admission that he did at least something wrong--was already in the news Flynn was under investigation.


http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-defending-mike-flynn-2017-5/#gen-flynn-is-a-wonderful-man-i-think-he-has-been-treated-very-very-unfairly-by-the-media-as-i-call-it-the-fake-media-in-many-cases-and-i-think-it-is-really-a-sad-thing-that-he-was-treated-so-badly-1

	"The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story ... I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration."


What is Trump even thinking here? "Flynn is a great guy--but can you believe Obama hired him?"

Pointing this out doesn't help Flynn--it helps himself.

	 TRUMP: Well, I think that's probably because Hillary, that's all they talk about is temperament. I think I have a great temperament. I beat 16 very talented people in -- and I've never done this before. You don't do that with a bad temperament.

	I'm leading her in the polls, as you probably have noticed. And I think I have a great temperament.

	I have a temperament where I know how to win. She doesn't know how to win. She's not a winner. She doesn't know how to win.

	Honestly, she lies a lot and she really -- she should tell the truth. I honestly believe if she told the truth -- because she made some reference to my campaigning, I've had a beautiful -- I've had a -- had a flawless campaign. You'll be writing books about this campaign. And yet she's criticizing my campaign.

	Now, her campaign, she couldn't beat Bernie, OK?

	STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, she did beat him.

	TRUMP: Well, barely. And there's questions even about that. But barely. And if you look at what's going on in terms of unity, the Bernie people are angry. They're angry. He was angry.

	What was amazing to me is when she was talking about Bernie last night, the camera was on him and he was angry. It almost looks like he has buyer's remorse, like he shouldn't have made the deal. 


wtf is he talking about? is this the conpsiracy theory with Bernie doing the "no negative" deal I as looking at before?

whatever he's talking about, why does he talk about it like everybody knows about it..? or is this his way of signalling to Clinton he knows about it or something?


	 STEPHANOPOULOS: You've never spoken to him on the phone?

	TRUMP: I have never spoken to him on the phone, no. I've speak -- I've spoken -- when we had the Miss Universe contest a number of years ago, we had Miss Universe in Moscow, in the Moscow area, he was invited. He wanted to come. He wasn't able to come.

	That would have been a time when I would have met him. 


is this what that "Putin best friend" tweet was about?

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-vice-president-joe-biden/story?id=41020870
	 TRUMP: No, because you're not going to do that. NATO is going to be just fine. But NATO countries -- we have 28 countries -- many of them are taking advantage of us because they're not paying. So we're protecting these countries and they're not paying.

	And when people leave that last part in, everybody agrees with me.

	I'm all in favor of NATO. I said NATO is obsolete. I was asked a question by one of your competitors and I said NATO is obsolete, because it's not taking care of terror. You understand that. And it turned out I was right. A lot of people gave me credit for that.

	Then, three months ago, on the front page of "The Wall Street Journal," they said NATO to develop a terror division. And somebody who's supposed to be very extraordinary was put in charge of it.

	That was all because of me. So I was right about that. 


amazing


Trump seems to see a lot of weird connections where others don't...

	Former intelligence and military officers told TheDCNF they agree Flynn was the victim of a highly orchestrated “disinformation campaign” generated by current and former intelligence officers, many with loyalties to former President Obama.

	friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. 


France is no longer France.

	TRUMP: Because it's under order. And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under -- I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?


hmmm

	QUESTION: (inaudible) Putin (ph) say stay out? Why not say that?

	TRUMP: Why do I have to (ph) get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir...


so that's where he says this


	QUESTION: Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date?

	TRUMP: I think everything's is out of date. We have a whole new world. When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked. Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right. You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old.

	NATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago. Today we have a different threat. We have a terror threat. And we have an ISIS threat. And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned. It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention. And everyone's talking about it. The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it.


So is that why Trump thinks NATO is obselete? because Russia "isn't a threat" anymore?

	QUESTION: (inaudible) will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia? According to...

	TRUMP: I'll tell you what. Let me say it once again. Let me say it once again. OK? Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe. And they can afford to pay this. It's not like they can't afford it.

	They just see us as a soft touch. You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch. I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes. But in business, they call them a soft touch. They haven't paid us. OK? I want them to pay.

	Excuse me. I'm not saying anything. I don't talk. I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do -- we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that. I don't talk. But they're going to pay.

	No, no -- yeah, it sends a signal. You know what signal it says? It says we're going to pay.

	You know, somebody said, "but we have treaties." I said that's right. And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay. They're going to pay. And they will pay. They will pay.


Angry at NATO for "ripping us off" I guess?


	QUESTION: Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than (inaudible)?

	TRUMP: President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations. You can't be worse. Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China. Well, they're united now, in a true sense. They've never been closer.

	They're selling oil to China. We forced them into this position.


Does Trump think he needs to ally with Russia to counter China? he's very down on China

funny that it turns out Russia has been trying to divide U.S. and china

Trump seems to be saying U.S. should divide China and Russia


	QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

	TRUMP: No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians. I have no idea. It's probably not Russia. Nobody knows if it's Russia. You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails. We don't even know who it is.

	I heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China. Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q. that can't get up in the morning, OK? Nobody knows. Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia. Might be Russia. But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States.

he got that right


	QUESTION: Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations...

	TRUMP: We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said. But we wanted...

	(CROSSTALK)

	TRUMP: Excuse me, listen. We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.

	Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.


thought he said make up a lot of their assets

	QUESTION: (inaudible) you are the nominee. Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running (inaudible)?

	TRUMP: No, I think we -- it's possible we have. But I'm not -- I'm only interested in winning. Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage. I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership. And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us -- tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe.

	I'll get along great with the leadership. And we'll do well.


Trump denies his campaign building up a relation with any country

but Flynn was texting Kislyak the entire time, like super close

	QUESTION: I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize (inaudible) Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are (inaudible)?

	TRUMP: We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.


so Trump planning on addressing the sanctions surrounding Crimea, basically


	...I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning.


Trump a prophet

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/michael-flynn-donald-trump-national-security-adviser.html
	WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn told President Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case.

	Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Mr. Flynn of the inquiry, Mr. Trump made Mr. Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Mr. Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by American intelligence agencies.


hmmm, made to his lawyer? is that a problem where attorney-client privilege means you can never figure out for sure in a court? or is it different for WH counsel?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Counsel
	Although the White House Counsel offers legal advice to the President, the Counsel does so in the President's official capacity, and does not serve as the President's personal attorney. Therefore, controversy has emerged over the scope of the attorney–client privilege between the Counsel and the President, namely with John Dean of Watergate notoriety.

	PIRRO: Will you be able to work with Schumer after all the horrible things he said about you?

	TRUMP: It's pretty tough to work with him. I am surprised because I have known him for a long time.

	PIRRO: Right.

	TRUMP: Again, he's gone very, very far left. He doesn't have good control of his party, he's not a good leader. And I think it's going to be pretty tough for me to work with him. We'll see. Hopefully what will happen is in `18, we'll going to elect some Republican senators, because we only have a margin of two. We'll going to elect some people, some more Republicans and we will be able to do it without having to go through that situation with Schumer. Because honestly, they just want to stop things, they want to clog up the wheels. And we can't let that happen.


Trump a falling out with Schumer? known him for a long time, perhaps feels betrayed?

 	FBI Director James Comey to stay on in Trump administration

	By Matt Zapotosky, Ellen Nakashima and Greg Miller January 24

	...The news that Comey would stay in place became public Tuesday, some time after he began informing senior FBI officials around the country that he had been asked to continue.

	Under normal circumstances, the revelation might have been unsurprising: Comey is less than four years into a 10-year term, and it is extremely rare for a president to remove an FBI director. But President Trump had notably declined to say whether he would keep the FBI director, telling “60 Minutes” in an interview after his election that he wanted to meet with Comey first. 


https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
	HOLT: Was it in a phone call? Did you meet face to face?

	TRUMP: I had a dinner with him. He wanted to have dinner because he wanted to stay on. We had a very nice dinner at the White House...

	HOLT: He -- he asked...

	(CROSSTALK)

	TRUMP: ...very early on. That dinner was arranged. I think he asked for the dinner.

	And he wanted to stay on as the FBI head. And I said I'll, you know, consider. We'll see what happens.


oh wow

does Trump think Comey is talking to him through the Washington post?


------


http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-idUSKBN14X1FZ
	FBI Director James Comey said on Oct. 28 the agency was reviewing emails that might be relevant to a previous inquiry into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, then announced on Nov. 6 that the fresh review had yielded nothing to change the agency's finding that she was not guilty of criminal wrongdoing.

	"What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had, she should never have been allowed to run - guilty as hell," Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday.


hmmm

Would Trump know about the Flynn Clinton email thing?


------

https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html
HOLT: Did you know that he had had -- that received payments from the Russian government? That he had...

TRUMP: No.

HOLT: ...received payments from the Turkish government?

TRUMP: No, but Obama perhaps knew because he had clearance from the Obama administration. And his -- and -- and this is something they never want to report.

He had clearance from the Obama administration, the highest clearance you can have. And I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talk about that.

You know, you're talking about 2015. I don't know that I knew him in 2015.


Maybe important to keep in mind:

Trump doesn't actually care about Flynn

Trump only cares about himself.


Even defending Flynn would be just to make himself look better, make it look like he didn't make a mistake

took him off VP shortlist after Flynn flubbed abortion question

fired him when keeping him on made him look bad


why not fire him earlier? could have figured it would be an admission of guilt in a way, an admission that he did at least something wrong--was already in the news Flynn was under investigation.


http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-defending-mike-flynn-2017-5/#gen-flynn-is-a-wonderful-man-i-think-he-has-been-treated-very-very-unfairly-by-the-media-as-i-call-it-the-fake-media-in-many-cases-and-i-think-it-is-really-a-sad-thing-that-he-was-treated-so-badly-1

	"The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story ... I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration."


What is Trump even thinking here? "Flynn is a great guy--but can you believe Obama hired him?"

Pointing this out doesn't help Flynn--it helps himself.

	 TRUMP: Well, I think that's probably because Hillary, that's all they talk about is temperament. I think I have a great temperament. I beat 16 very talented people in -- and I've never done this before. You don't do that with a bad temperament.

	I'm leading her in the polls, as you probably have noticed. And I think I have a great temperament.

	I have a temperament where I know how to win. She doesn't know how to win. She's not a winner. She doesn't know how to win.

	Honestly, she lies a lot and she really -- she should tell the truth. I honestly believe if she told the truth -- because she made some reference to my campaigning, I've had a beautiful -- I've had a -- had a flawless campaign. You'll be writing books about this campaign. And yet she's criticizing my campaign.

	Now, her campaign, she couldn't beat Bernie, OK?

	STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, she did beat him.

	TRUMP: Well, barely. And there's questions even about that. But barely. And if you look at what's going on in terms of unity, the Bernie people are angry. They're angry. He was angry.

	What was amazing to me is when she was talking about Bernie last night, the camera was on him and he was angry. It almost looks like he has buyer's remorse, like he shouldn't have made the deal. 


wtf is he talking about? is this the conpsiracy theory with Bernie doing the "no negative" deal I as looking at before?

whatever he's talking about, why does he talk about it like everybody knows about it..? or is this his way of signalling to Clinton he knows about it or something?


	 STEPHANOPOULOS: You've never spoken to him on the phone?

	TRUMP: I have never spoken to him on the phone, no. I've speak -- I've spoken -- when we had the Miss Universe contest a number of years ago, we had Miss Universe in Moscow, in the Moscow area, he was invited. He wanted to come. He wasn't able to come.

	That would have been a time when I would have met him. 


is this what that "Putin best friend" tweet was about?

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-vice-president-joe-biden/story?id=41020870
	 TRUMP: No, because you're not going to do that. NATO is going to be just fine. But NATO countries -- we have 28 countries -- many of them are taking advantage of us because they're not paying. So we're protecting these countries and they're not paying.

	And when people leave that last part in, everybody agrees with me.

	I'm all in favor of NATO. I said NATO is obsolete. I was asked a question by one of your competitors and I said NATO is obsolete, because it's not taking care of terror. You understand that. And it turned out I was right. A lot of people gave me credit for that.

	Then, three months ago, on the front page of "The Wall Street Journal," they said NATO to develop a terror division. And somebody who's supposed to be very extraordinary was put in charge of it.

	That was all because of me. So I was right about that. 


amazing

	friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. 


France is no longer France.

	TRUMP: Because it's under order. And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under -- I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?


hmmm

	QUESTION: (inaudible) Putin (ph) say stay out? Why not say that?

	TRUMP: Why do I have to (ph) get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir...


so that's where he says this

given that Trump thinks people actually listen to his demands, this takes on a new meaning...


	QUESTION: Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date?

	TRUMP: I think everything's is out of date. We have a whole new world. When I said that NATO, to Wolf Blitzer, is obsolete, I got attacked. Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right. You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because they're 20 and 30 and 40 years old.

	NATO, you know this isn't a country from 40 years ago. Today we have a different threat. We have a terror threat. And we have an ISIS threat. And by the way, ISIS isn't even mentioned. It's not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention. And everyone's talking about it. The reason they can't mention it is because they grew it.


So is that why Trump thinks NATO is obselete? because Russia "isn't a threat" anymore?

	QUESTION: (inaudible) will you defend the Baltic states if they're invaded by Russia? According to...

	TRUMP: I'll tell you what. Let me say it once again. Let me say it once again. OK? Many countries, including the NATO countries, some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe. And they can afford to pay this. It's not like they can't afford it.

	They just see us as a soft touch. You know, in business we say somebody's a soft touch. I don't know if I've been called a soft touch, but maybe I have sometimes. But in business, they call them a soft touch. They haven't paid us. OK? I want them to pay.

	Excuse me. I'm not saying anything. I don't talk. I'm not like Obama where he tells you everything he's going to do -- we're going to go and do this; we're going to go and do that. I don't talk. But they're going to pay.

	No, no -- yeah, it sends a signal. You know what signal it says? It says we're going to pay.

	You know, somebody said, "but we have treaties." I said that's right. And in the treaties, they're supposed to pay. They're going to pay. And they will pay. They will pay.


Angry at NATO for "ripping us off" I guess?


	QUESTION: Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than (inaudible)?

	TRUMP: President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations. You can't be worse. Hey look, when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that I've always found fascinating, one thing that I've always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China. Well, they're united now, in a true sense. They've never been closer.

	They're selling oil to China. We forced them into this position.


Does Trump think he needs to ally with Russia to counter China? he's very down on China

funny that it turns out Russia has been trying to divide U.S. and china

Trump seems to be saying U.S. should divide China and Russia


	QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)

	TRUMP: No, but they seem to be, if it's Russians. I have no idea. It's probably not Russia. Nobody knows if it's Russia. You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country, not in government unfortunately, but with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails. We don't even know who it is.


what if he's trying to strike some kind of deal with Russia? "release the emails and I won't tell anybody." which would be treason, of course.


	I heard this morning, one report said they don't think it's Russia, they think it might be China. Another report said it might be just a hacker, some guy with a 200 I.Q. that can't get up in the morning, OK? Nobody knows. Honestly they have no idea if it's Russia. Might be Russia. But if it's any foreign country, it shows how little respect they have for the United States.

he got that right


	QUESTION: Did Don Jr. say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations...

	TRUMP: We wanted to, yeah, I don't know what he said. But we wanted...

	(CROSSTALK)

	TRUMP: Excuse me, listen. We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.

	Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.


thought he said make up a lot of their assets

	QUESTION: (inaudible) you are the nominee. Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November, that you don't have to hit the ground running (inaudible)?

	TRUMP: No, I think we -- it's possible we have. But I'm not -- I'm only interested in winning. Once I win, I'll get along great with foreign leaders, but they won't be taking advantage. I mean, the problem we have with foreign leaders, whether it's China, Russia, or anybody, they don't respect our leadership. And certainly in the case of China, they take tremendous economic advantage of us -- tremendous, to a point that is hard to believe.

	I'll get along great with the leadership. And we'll do well.


Trump denies his campaign building up a relation with any country

but Flynn was texting Kislyak the entire time, like super close

	QUESTION: I would like to know if you became president, would you recognize (inaudible) Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S. would lift sanctions that are (inaudible)?

	TRUMP: We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.


so Trump planning on addressing the sanctions surrounding Crimea, basically


	...I don't like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets, OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldn't have had it and that they're missing 33,000 e-mails and that's just the beginning.


Trump a prophet

I wonder if they try to make Trump's super-secret deals through the media come true so he feels like he's making deals?

	Trump writes that Cohn most valued toughness and loyalty, which he admired. 

	In addition to being his lawyer, Cohn introduced Trump to influential people across New York and Washington, D.C., including one of President Richard Nixon's strategists, Roger Stone, a man who would help him get elected president in 2016.


fukkin what


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cohn
	Roy Marcus Cohn (/koʊn/; February 20, 1927 – August 2, 1986) was an American attorney. During Senator Joseph McCarthy's investigations into Communist activity in the United States during the Second Red Scare, Cohn served as McCarthy's chief counsel and gained special prominence during the Army–McCarthy hearings.


he maybe this is something here

like a link to a Russian agent of influence maybe

he help fan flames of red scare or something?


	When imagining himself in the shoes of Barron Hilton in the midst of Steve Wynn's 1979 takeover threat, Trump writes that he would have pushed back and, "I'm not saying I would also have won, but if I went down, it would have been kicking and screaming. I would have closed the hotel and let it rot. That's just my makeup. I fight when I feel I'm getting screwed, even if it's costly and difficult and highly risky."


in other words, needs to be shot, won't resign? not that I believe him...


	Trump developed a habit early in his career of closely monitoring all media coverage of himself and his properties, and often wrote letters to reporters and writers when he disagreed with their criticisms. "My people keep telling me I shouldn't write letters like this to critics," he writes. "The way I see it, critics get to say what they want about my work, so why shouldn't I be able to say what I want about theirs?"

	Trump also learned to make the most of a disastrous story, as when he made the decision to destroy a few sculptures when he made way for Trump Tower in 1979, not expecting an outcry from art lovers and designers.

	"Even though the publicity was almost entirely negative, there was a great deal of it, and that drew a tremendous amount of attention to Trump Tower," he writes. "Almost immediately we saw an upsurge in the sales of apartments. I'm not saying that's a good thing, and in truth it probably says something perverse about the culture we live in. But I'm a businessman, and I learned a lesson from that experience: good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells."

	A “John Baron,” described as a “vice-president of the Trump organization,” appeared in a front-page New York Times article as early as 1980, defending Trump’s decision to destroy sculptures on the facade of the Bonwit Teller department store building, the Fifth Avenue landmark he was demolishing to make way for his Trump Tower. Barron was quoted variously as a “Trump spokesman,” “Trump executive” or “Trump representative” in New York magazine, The Washington Post and other publications.


So Trump manipulates the media and cares a lot about it.


	...Miller also revealed to Carswell why Trump seemed to relish any and all media coverage, even the most critical. “I can tell you that he didn’t care if he got bad PR until he got his divorce finished,” Miller said. The more the press wrote about Trump’s money troubles, the greater advantage he would have in negotiations toward a financial settlement with his then-estranged wife, Ivana. Then, “once his divorce is finished,” Miller said, you would see stories about how Trump was “doing well financially and he’s doing well in every other way.”


Trump doesn't want people to know about his money troubles

because the KGB was helping him out


	...Carswell, now a reporter-researcher at Vanity Fair, said the tape cuts off mid-interview, leaving out the part in which Miller said that actress Kim Basinger had been trying to date Trump. Hearing the tape for the first time in decades, Carswell said, “This was so farcical, that he pretended to be his own publicist. Here was this so-called billion-dollar real estate mogul, and he can’t hire his own publicist. It also said something about the control he wanted to keep of the news cycle flowing with this story, and I can’t believe he thought he’d get away with it.”


right, Trump likes to control the media


maybe explains in part why he cares so much about leaks? wants to control those?

	....From the start of his career as a builder in New York, Trump worked the press. He believed in carrots and sticks, showering reporters with praise, then pivoting to a threat to sue them if they wrote something he considered inaccurate. He often said that all publicity, good or bad, was good for his business.

"carrots and sticks" by way of the media



	...Carswell had been skeptical all along. On the recording, she challenged Miller: “Where did you come from?”

	“I basically worked for different firms,” he replied cryptically. And then he marveled at his boss’s ability to withstand critical news coverage: “I’ve never seen somebody so immune to . . . bad press.”

Trump hates bad press

but all he gets is bad press

for treason

Mika Brzezinksi says Trump trying to blackmail them using media? hmmm


http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/30/morning-joe-hosts-suggest-white-house-threatened-to-blackmail-them.html
	MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough said Friday that White House officials threatened to arrange for negative news coverage against them if they did not tone down their criticism of President Donald Trump.

	Speaking a day after Trump's Twitter blast against the "Morning Joe" co-hosts, they said the threat involved a damaging story in the National Enquirer. Trump is friendly with David Pecker, CEO of the tabloid's parent company American Media Inc.

	"They were calling my children, they were calling close friends of mine, and they were pinning the story on my ex-husband who would absolutely never do that," Brzezinski said. "So I knew immediately it was a lie and they had nothing. These calls persisted for quite some time."

	The calls kept coming and they were like ‘you need to call, please call',” he added.

	Trump has often spoken of his long-standing personal relationship with David Pecker, the owner of the National Enquirer. During the 2016 campaign, Trump several times referred to negative stories in the tabloid aimed at his rivals, such as Ben Carson and Ted Cruz.

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/trumps-alliance-with-the-national-enquirer.html
	Trump’s spokesperson, Hope Hicks, told me “there’s absolutely no truth” to the claim Trump was behind the article. When I asked the Enquirer for comment, Pecker said it was “utterly false” that the Trump campaign was their source. “We did what the National Enquirer has always done, our investigative reporters went back and poured through numerous legal documents to discover the details that led to our exclusive coverage of malpractice claims against Ben Carson,” he said in a statement.


huh

does Trump actually plant stories in the national enquirer?

seems like someone wants people to think so?

	“Oh, that’s Donald,” Carswell recalled Adams saying. “What is he doing?”

	Then Carswell played the tape for Maples, who confirmed it was Trump and burst into tears as she heard Miller deny that a ring Trump gave her implied any intent to marry her.


point of that?


wonder if there's an example of Trump blackmailing someone, or trying to

tries to threaten press

threatens Congress

but subtle, sort of implied threats in media?

a KGB agent trying to sound like Trump or Trump sounding like a PR person?


didn't Melania snipe Trump after Maples? "John Miller" help with that?

	The couples went deep-sea fishing and ate clams on the half shell. Once, when they spotted a Soviet trawler in international waters off the coast of Montauk, Freddy circled it as his friends jeered, “Do svidaniya!” — Russian for “goodbye.”


what

is this when the KGB replaced him with a body double or something

	Then came the unveiling of Fred Sr.’s will, which Donald had helped draft. It divided the bulk of the inheritance, at least $20 million, among his children and their descendants, “other than my son Fred C. Trump Jr.”

	Freddy’s children sued, claiming that an earlier version of the will had entitled them to their father’s share of the estate, but that Donald and his siblings had used “undue influence” over their grandfather, who had dementia, to cut them out.

	A week later, Mr. Trump retaliated by withdrawing the medical benefits critical to his nephew’s infant child.

	“I was angry because they sued,” he explained during last week’s interview.

wtf


ok but this shows holding leverage, and I guess using it. Sort of like blackmailing. Is that how Trump thinks of "business?"

Maybe that's why Putin likes "businessmen." Thinks they are easier to blackmail.


	...Mr. Trump said that the litigation had been settled “very amicably” and that he was fond of Fred III, who works in real estate, though not for the Trump organization. He also said that, at 69, he had grown to appreciate his brother’s free spirit.

	“He would have been an amazing peacemaker if he didn’t have the problem, because everybody loved him,” he said. “He’s like the opposite of me.”


wow


http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/what-sort-of-man-is-donald-trump
	Trump and his siblings insisted that the will accurately reflected their father’s wishes. After the challenge, it didn’t take them long to retaliate. On March 30th, Fred III received a certified letter telling him that the medical benefits provided to his family by the Trump organization would end on May 1st. The letter prompted Fred III to return to court, this time in Nassau County, where a judge ordered the Trumps to restore the health coverage until the dispute was resolved. “I will stick to my guns,” Fred III told Evans. “I just think it was wrong. These are not warm and fuzzy people. They never even came to see William in the hospital. Our family puts the ‘fun’ in dysfunctional.” Fred III’s sister, Mary, told Evans, “William is my father’s grandson. He is as much a part of that family as anybody else. He desperately needs extra care.”

	Trump, for his part, was unapologetic about his actions. “Why should we give him medical coverage?” he told Evans. When she asked him if he thought he might come across as cold-hearted, given the baby’s medical condition, he said, “I can’t help that. It’s cold when someone sues my father. Had he come to see me, things could very possibly have been much different for them.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_pseudonyms
	The Washington Post suggested that Trump might have used the pseudonym longer "if not for a lawsuit in which he testified, under oath in 1990, that 'I believe on occasion I used that name.'"


boom

there it is

its real

	She says Trump later told her it was a "joke gone awry".[2] In 2016, The Washington Post obtained a copy of the tape and reported that it was Trump using a pseudonym. Trump denied it, saying "It was not me on the phone." Later, when a reporter asked Trump if he had ever employed a spokesperson named John Miller, he hung up on them.


I mean that is pretty convincing

could still pull the same trick regardless but hey

	At one point, Trump, who spends millions of dollars advertising his name, acknowledged that he has used an alias, "John Baron." ...

	A former Trump executive has acknowledged in court papers that he had used the same alias in connection with the Trump Tower project. An attorney representing the Polish workers has charged that someone using the name "John Baron" had called and said Trump might sue him for $100 million.

	Trump testified he used the name only "years later." Afterward, he told reporters, "Lots of people use pen names. Ernest Hemingway used one."


Trump likes to try to manipulate people by threatening to sue them


http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/donald-trump-fake-names/
	John Baron became expendable in 1990, when Trump testified in the case of some workers who said he owed them $1 million because, as undocumented immigrants, they had been underpaid by one of his contractors. Years earlier, “John Baron” had said the workers might be counter-sued by Trump.

	When asked under oath who Baron might be, Trump confessed that it was an alias he had used.



http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/donald-trump-fake-names/
	After admitting under oath that Baron was a fake, Trump apparently offered a new spokesman, John Miller, to Sue Carswell of People magazine in 1991. Unlike Baron, who was concerned with business matters, Miller served to spread gossip about Trump’s romantic exploits. Miller made sure that Carswell understood that Trump was practically being hounded by celebrated women – Kim Basinger and Madonna were mentioned - and that in addition to his relationship with Marla Maples he had “three other girlfriends.”

	In an interviewed recorded on tape by Sue Carswell, Miller explains that Trump broke things off with Maples – “he really didn’t want to make a commitment” -- in favor of the celebrity beauty Carla Bruni. Miller went on to say Trump was doing “tremendously well financially “and that many other famous women were pursuing him romantically.

	Carswell produced an article titled, “Trump Says Goodbye Marla, Hello Carla.” That story was picked up by The New York Post.


not sure what's up with this. Problem is that afaik Marla Maples is not a Czech intelligence agent.


	Trump: "You know it doesn't really matter what [the media] write as long as you've got a young, beautiful piece of ass"

	Never short of vanity, Trump has often spoken of his own supposed beauty. And he considers the attention he might get from attractive women to be protection from negative publicity. “You know it doesn’t really matter what (the media) write as long as you’ve got a young, beautiful piece of ass,” he told Esquire in 1991.

	Trump was, at the time, enduring the shame of his Atlantic City casino bankruptcy. Trump Airways was failing. And he would soon have to sell the Plaza Hotel. Deprived of a plausible claim to brilliance in business, he turned toward the other symbol of status he valued the most – beautiful women. Trump wanted the world to know he was being swarmed by desirable women, and therefore he was a much desired man, he couldn’t resist decorating the tale with bold face names. And as any good gossip monger knows, it’s always better to have someone else say that you are handsome, appealing, and in demand, than to say it yourself. By having John Miller inform Sue Carswell, Trump created a degree of separation between himself and the claim which made it just a little more credible.

	Unfortunately Bruni wasn’t willing to play along. Carswell also later said that Trump confessed to her that he was, in fact, John Miller.


curios as to what role this played in divorce? not like I really want to learn about such things...


	Trump adopts a new form of verbal trickery

	That episode was the last known time that “John Miller” spoke for Trump, but Trump only moved into a more slippery way of promoting himself and evading responsibility for what he says. He began using a rhetorical technique called paralipsis, which enables you to make inflammatory statements without taking responsibility for them. You can credit or blame others for the content.

	So, in 2008, when radio host Howard Stern asked Trump if he had dated Bruni, Trump didn’t swat away the false rumor his fake publicist apparently started. Instead Trump said “no comment,” which encouraged Stern to keep on talking about her.

	Stern asked, “Was she bad in bed?”

	Trump replied, “I can’t comment on that. She’s gonna marry the president of France. I want to have good relationships with France. I don’t want to be criticizing first lady of France.”

	With their performance, which lasted several minutes and was heard by millions, Trump and Stern managed to create the impression that Trump had firsthand knowledge of Bruni’s sexual behaviors even though he never actually confirmed he had dated her. Trump used similar trickery when he retweeted a deceptive message about race and crime and then denied responsibility for the lies in the text because “all it was was a retweet.” As he said at the time that he distributed false data on crime, “This was a retweet. And it comes from sources that are very credible, what can I tell you?”


This is something. Arguably Trump knows about this just by virtue of this article about his personal life being published in fortune (claims he likes financial media).

http://fortune.com/2016/05/16/donald-trump-pr-people/
	Is it possible to be sure? Probably not. But the reporter had taped the phone call and played the tape for people who know Trump. Said columnist Cindy Adams: ''There is no John Miller. That's Donald.'' Said a former close associate who also ID'd the voice: ''Is he whacked out, or what?''

	Astoundingly, and sadly, the most telling response came from Marla Maples herself. After she listened to a fragment and identified Trump, she was flabbergasted. It was the first time she had heard him publicly declare the relationship over. ''I'm shocked and devastated,'' she said. ''I feel betrayed at the deepest level. My friends and family have been praying for me for a long time, and this may be the answer to their prayers.'' Still, she added, ''No matter what, I came into this for love, and I hope he finds happiness.''


fucking christ

I don't have time to investigate this

	On the controversial ''engagement'' ring: ''This was [about] giving Tiffany some business and getting Ivana, uh, getting Marla something that would be nice.'' Apprised of all this, Maples appeared distraught and genuinely confused. ''Two weeks ago he was asking her when she wanted to get married,'' says a close friend of Marla's. ''She didn't know they were ending like this.''

	When the reporter called Trump's office for an explanation, she was told that John Miller had gone home and that Trump would have no comment.


but that's suspicious as fuck

	But to John Barron, a "Trump spokesperson," that wasn't the case: Selling the property was Trump's idea the whole time, Barron told reporters, making it seem like the real estate mogul had never even wanted the damn castle in the first place, and was happy to see it go: "It sure is easier to get a large commission on a $105-million sale than to put up a building," Barron told New York at the time. Contrary to the public's perception, Trump actually left the bruising battle victorious—at least according to Trump himself. 


	...Over the course of nearly a decade, Trump was quick to dispatch John Barron to share his position on deals with media outlets: "We have no interest whatsoever in Lincoln West," Barron told the New York Times, in response to questions about a Manhattan property in 1984. 


Ok there's something

deals over media

	...Hilton, the famous hotelier who Trump bought out in Atlantic City ("John Baron," of course, announced that deal). 

that too?


	Having a fake identity, however, does run in the Trump family. As it turns out, years before the advent of John Barron, Donald's father, Fred Trump, would call competing real estate companies in the middle of night, introducing himself as "Mr. Green," to score inside information that might benefit his business. The lie became a well-known "family practice"—a tradition, of sorts—according to Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald's sister.

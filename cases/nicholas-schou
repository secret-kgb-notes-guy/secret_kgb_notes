	Q: You must not keep up with current events then.

	NicholasSchou: Elaborate please. I am familiar with the existence of fake internet accounts because my newspaper is trolled by these all the time. But they tend to seem like the work of trolls with nothing better to do than hide behind anonymity to harass people, not the product of "entities."

	...Q: To edit the question, have you heard of any entities making major efforts to alter political narrative through social media?

	NicholasSchou: I think corporate entities are trying to control the flow of information on the internet and in online communities via advertising and viral-based promotional strategies. The same corporate tactics are also used by political groups to promote their candidates.

	NicholasSchou: I think the CIA revels in the nefarious depiction it sees in over-the-top movies like the Bourne series. The agency doesn't care how it is perceived in fiction or in print, as long as reinforces the idea in people's minds that we would be worse off without it. I am less concerned with abolishing the agency than with focusing the minds of the American public on the massive expansion of secrecy and the public-private partnership that continues to gobble up our tax revenue in the name of national security and the war on terror. As Jonathan Kwitny best argued in his book Endless Enemies, the problem goes to the very foundation of our state: it is built on war and creates conflicts where there would be none.

	Sure. First of all, the big change in this nexus was Watergate and the Family Jewels scandal, which placed the CIA under congressional oversight and prohibited it from carrying out domestic spying operations or putting journalists on its payroll. But the brief window of aggressive investigative reporting during that era was quickly closed during the 1980s, with the rise of Reaganomics. Journalists have been under attack ever since then, with mounting financial pressure and the gradual corporate monopolization of the press. By the 1990s, the CIA had already effectively rehabilitated its image in the press (with the Gary Webb saga being one brief interruption) and this coincides with when the agency made overtures to work closely with Hollywood, seeing a new opportunity to burnish its image there--a decision that paid off handsomely for the agency.

	The CIA has worked behind the scenes with its allies in the news media to debunk any so-called conspiracy theories that challenge the agency's sense of purpose. It colluded with the press to control inquiries into JFK's assassination, hiding crucial information from congress and the public, and helped build a public relations campaign that tended to discredit legitimate research into what the CIA knew beforehand. This isn't to say the CIA whacked JFK per se, but rather that the agency knew that a fair inquiry into the matter would be very embarrassing to the agency, given its ties to obvious suspects, etc. This set the template for all future independent inquiries into CIA misconduct that lacked adequate political support: deny everything and wait for the frustrated, ill-equipped media to stop researching and turn on each other, etc...

	Nobody's asked about it yet, but another huge story Langley effectively planted in the media and Hollywood is the official story about how we supposedly found Osama bin Laden hiding out in Abbottabad. Seymour Hersh poked major holes in that story--which would definitely have come out differently if our helicopter hadn't crashed at the scene--and his major allegation that a Pakistani intelligence source told us bin Laden's whereabouts has yet to be debunked.

	I had included information about this that was edited out of the book for space reasons but also because it's already been reported. Bradlee himself talks all about Angleton and his bizarre behavior after the death of Mary Pinchot Meyer in his memoir. Rumors have always abounded about Bradlee's ties to the agency. I was told by a former Wash Post writer that Bradlee was terrified at the thought that the CIA would be able to recruit a spy inside the paper. I found this idea very ironic because that would be the worst use of agency funds imaginable--they already own the paper. Just read Veil, by Bob Woodward, in which CIA director Bill Casey told the Post that they were running a war in Central America without congressional approval, and Bradlee told Woodward to just sit on the info, which he did.)

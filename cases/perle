	According to then-Director of Central Intelligence George H.W. Bush, Carter “harbored a deep antipathy to the CIA.” 

	Post-Cold War policymakers also questioned the usefulness of intelligence. President Clinton rarely met with DCI James Woolsey, whom he mentioned only in passing in his memoir. President George W. Bush may have been more interested in intelligence, but others in his administration were skeptical at best. Richard Perle, a longtime associate of Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld, said that “CIA’s analysis isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”

	When President Obama nominated Clinton for secretary of state in 2008, Richard Perle, one of the Iraq War’s primary cheerleaders and chairman of the Defense Policy Board in the lead-up to the war, said he was “relieved.” “There's not going to be as much change as we were led to believe.”

	Perle, who was sometimes referred to as the “Prince of Darkness” and who once predicted there would be “some grand square in Baghdad that is named after President Bush,” made clear his support for Clinton was not due to a lack of choices. “I heard about others on the list [for secretary of state] that I wouldn't be happy about,” he said. “Those were mostly Republicans.”

	The Washington Post report on President Donald Trump disclosing classified information to Russian officials last week is "outrageously overblown" and proves that the media is "out to destroy this presidency," former Pentagon official Richard Perle told Newsmax TV on Tuesday.

	"There was no indication in the article — and this is now confirmed by the national security adviser that any classified information that was not either known or obvious was revealed in that conversation," Perle told Newsmax TV's Steve Malzberg.

	"This seems to me another example of parts of the mainstream press were clearly unambiguously out to destroy this presidency."

	Perle, 75, served as assistant secretary of defense and chairman on the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board. He worked under former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

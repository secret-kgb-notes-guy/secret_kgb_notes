	Vicky Pelaez, 55, is known for her leftist writings as a columnist for El Diario La Prensa, the largest Spanish-language daily newspaper in New York, as well as other publications. She has been a strident supporter of former Cuban President Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.

	The website of the Centre for Research on Globalisation, a Canadian organization opposed to globalization and the "new world order," ran an article by Pelaez in 2008 about the use of U.S. prison inmates as cheap labor.

	The US ruling class and its European counterparts, promoters of globalization and the creation of a new economic order of 1% of the richest and most powerful, have seen US President Donald Trump as a symbol of nationalism and populism A challenge to their agenda at a planetary level.

	Since his election as president of the United States, world elites have engaged in a struggle against this new US leader and are determined not to allow the process of de-globalization that Donald Trump apparently intends to initiate with his slogan 'America First '. 

	So great is the fear of global neoliberal elites to Donald Trump's leadership of the world that from the day of his investiture managed to promote, with the help of the media at his service, protests in Washington and many other cities Including demonstrators. The popular Craiglist portal offered $ 1,500 a week to participate in the Stop 'Trump' protests. The Women's March in Washington was scheduled last year with three key demands: Gender Justice, Racial Justice and Economic Justice. It was also 'mysteriously' reoriented towards an anti-Trump agenda. What was interesting was that the women's demonstrations against Trump on January 21 were held in 670 American cities and 70 in the world.

"paid protestors"

	In May 2016, during a CNN interview, Trump expressed skepticism about the vaccination of children, citing his own experience. "When [Barron] as a child was vaccinated, and a week later the fever went up and he felt very, very sick and now he is autistic." He said he was not against the vaccination, but demanded a previous and prolonged investigation of each vaccine. Well-known neurosurgeon Ben Garson also commented that "we are likely to get vaccinations in a very short period of time." Currently, this investigation has been ordered by the US president.


anti-vacc


Did they want to look incompetent? weird

Here she calls Trump a "useful buffoon"

	The curious thing about the aggressive anti-immigrant, racist and xenophobic rhetoric of "The Donald" is the fact that the author does not take into account that he is the son of immigrants. His mother was of Scottish origin and his paternal grandparents were German immigrants. During World War II (1939-1945) more than 15,000 German citizens were detained and transferred to special camps and another 15,000 were classified as potential enemies of North America. The current wife of "The Donald" Melania Knauss is a Slovenian model, but for people like Trump white immigrants do not fall into the category of deportables or undesirable that is exclusive to people of cinnamon, coffee or black.

	Reform always provokes rage on the part of those who benefit from the old order (Arthur M. Schlesinger, 1917-2007)

	As of November 9, violent demonstrations, well organized, have broken out in more than 30 US cities. In all localities the protesters have been carrying posters with the same slogans that said: 'Not My President', 'Black Lives Tell', 'Jews against Hate', 'No to a United States Fascist'. Thousands of Twitter invocations also appeared to 'kill Trump'.

	It was soon discovered that the protests have been instigated, convened and funded by the NGO MoveOn, belonging to one of the most sinister characters on our planet since the end of the 20th century, George Soros, who far surpasses Henry Kissinger himself. To understand how globalized media perceive Soros, it is worth reproducing an obituary that accidentally published the Reuters agency in 2013, because Soros is still very alive today, kicking and working against Trump. He said: "George Soros was an extremely successful predatory financier who for years fought against capitalism that gave him the possibility of making billions."

	George Soros, born in 1930 in Hungary into a Jewish family, named him Schwartz Gy√∂rgy. He has always liked to introduce himself as a messianic, philanthropist, independent philosopher who has nothing to do with all the power complexes in the United States. At the same time, the globalized press considers him as a radical Marxist who wants to build a free society without frontiers and with a single government for the whole world. In reality, neither of these characteristics are suitable for this financial magnate, whose capital is 24.9 billion dollars. His motto is to set up an 'Open Society' for himself and the whole world. What is promoting this financial speculator, called 'King Midas', destroying current societies to make money. For the money for this Messianic is everything, it is his God.


But if she doesn't like Trump, she doesn't like his opposition either

	What happens is that NATO members are worried about the cut of the contribution of North America to its budget, which reaches 72%. If Trump decides to fulfill his promise to make peace with Russia and cooperate in the common task of destroying the Islamic State and other related terrorist organizations, a heavily armed NATO would not be needed, as the only 'enemy' of the European Union, artificially created By 'enlightened' globalizers, would become its ally.


So still writing in 2016, articles very conspiratorial and weird

	The unbridled and hysterical rusophobic campaign unleashed by the Democrats in the United States, using fabricated accusations and simply ridiculous without any support, in addition presenting Vladimir Putin as a Machiavellian 'Master of the Universe' that makes and undoes Governments, is demonstrating the despair of the call "Leftist" opposition to the advance of Donald Trump, who would uncover the gigantic murky deals of the Democrats with the Russians, including the sale of US uranium.

	Since when is Russia an enemy of the United States? 


lol

but she was literally arrested for being a Russian spy

	Again the great interests of the West and the East are dragging a country to the brink of civil war. Ukraine, where the result of the presidential elections has divided the population, and is today the coveted enclave, but what few means in the world say is that for a decade the archimillonary George Soros, the only American who "has his Own foreign policy and the infrastructure to install it, "was preparing the conditions for Kiev to be the next NATO military base and stop being the strategic ally of Russia.

I guess she was always kind of conspiratorial?

	This was the case with The Washington Post, whose directors have always been part of the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, the Council of Foreign Relations, and so on. As Nixon's dictatorial ambitions and anti-Semitism were considered harmful to the globalization process, then American and multinational corporate circles made the decision to remove him from power.

Some pro-Russian anti-Clinton article from Sept 29 2015


https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=en&prev=search&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=es&sp=nmt4&u=https://www.aporrea.org/tiburon/a235967.html&usg=ALkJrhhJipHqWMMH1zefujDNT_noK-k46A
	Of course, it must be made clear that, despite the differences between the speech of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, both candidates belong to the same system and represent their interests, and will always follow the instructions or orders of that 1% of the most Rich and powerful. At any time, according to the interests of the ruling class, each of their candidates could change their speech. In 2013, Hillary Clinton, for example, had a very positive opinion about Vladimir Putin, but in 2014 she abruptly changed her views and later compared Putin to Hitler. It all depends on the 1% directives.

	Meanwhile, the system needs Hillary Clinton for the presidency of the country. He wants it at this moment as the "queen of war," whose rhetoric sweetens the ears of the military-industrial complex and those of enlightened globalizers or, as they call them in the United States, the wheelchair hawks. President Obama presents her as "the most qualified candidate in the history of the country." No one audits or analyzes what happened to the 200,000 million foreign aid she administered between 2009-2012 when she was Secretary of State, even though Clinton herself admitted that the Agency for International Development (AID) she administered " Major flaws and needed a reorganization. "

She was famous, which is interesting.

	In 1984, at the height of her career, Pelaez and her cameraman were kidnapped by one of Peru's leftist guerrilla organizations, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). They were held prisoners until Channel 2 agreed to broadcast the rebels' message to the nation.

Kidnapped by Tupac

	Some, including her cameraman, claimed Pelaez was a willing accomplice to her kidnapping. Soon after, she left Peru and moved to New York, where shelanded a job as a reporter at El Diario, the city's oldest Spanish-language daily.

She *wanted* to be kidnapped by Tupac

author calls her incompetent

(maybe she is? was famous tho)

	The science states that the measles vaccine is effective.  But the debate over vaccines overall has been controversial.  This is because of some studies which pointed to an apparent link between vaccines and autism.  Even Barack Obama cited this potential link during his 2008 presidential campaign.  He wasn't alone.  At the time, both Hillary Clinton and John McCain similarly expressed possible connections and reservations.  But the science appears to have evolved‚Äùsince then, and the link between the two has largely been debunked. 

	This hasn't stopped the American public from expressing its concern.  Recent Pew polling shows that 30% of Americans believe that vaccinating their children should be a matter of parental choice.  This leave 68% of Americans who believe that vaccines should be required by the government. 

	Herein lies the political debate: Should vaccinations be a parental choice or mandated by the government? 


Hannity every so gently tiptoeing into anti-vax movement


Seems like he's mostly just trying to politicize it

where he started

booted for homophobia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity

	Hannity's weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year. This was after two shows featuring the book The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS by Gene Antonio

started with the Okhrana early? I figured they would have used AIDS to increase homophobia, make it easier to blackmail people

	In September 1996, Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title Hannity and LTBD ("liberal to be determined").[14] Alan Colmes was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as Hannity & Colmes.

Of course Ailes is behind all this

	Hannity has stated that he is too busy to write many books,[33] and dictated a lot of his own two books into a tape recorder while driving in to do his radio show.


Hannity is a busy man. Works hard it seems--but for what?


Some sort of fight between Cruz camp and Hannity/Trump camp

	He also shared a photo from the fringe news site Gateway Pundit and falsely claimed that it showed her Secret Service agent holding a diazepam pen intended to treat seizures, when he in fact was holding a small flashlight.[50] Furthermore, he booked medical pundits on his show to discuss these baseless theories; these pundits, despite never having personally examined Clinton, made alarmist statements about her state of health.

so documented bringing on talking heads? his "debates" do seem like plays

so is he going to quit or not?

	Out of respect for the family's wishes for now


uhh ok

	Later in the opening monologue, Hannity appeared to indicate that he may visit Rich stories again "at the proper time." 

implying some bombshell will come out showing he was right


who knows, maybe one will? or maybe the KGB will fake it 100%

either way the problem was he was a dick to the poor kid's family...


------

obviously anti-global warming, nothing surprising here

that one's sort of trickier it's not particularly horrifying until you get a sense of how Okhrana thinks of it, why people spread the propaganda

	Hannity on attempted advertiser boycott: 'Nobody tells me what to say on my show'

You sure about that?

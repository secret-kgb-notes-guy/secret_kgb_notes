	Valerie Plame, a Santa Fe resident and former CIA agent who will discuss Goodman’s new book with him on Monday night, also argues there are too few protections for those who might step forward.

	“The cases we know of — it’s very sad how they have been handled,” she said, pointing to Bill Binney, a former National Security Agency staffer who called for an internal investigation of mass surveillance programs. Federal investigators launched a probe that put Binney out of business and led agents to raid his home.

	Plame said she does not agree with Goodman on everything, and she wants to talk Monday about other issues, ranging from Russian meddling in the last election to the Trump administration, but this is one particular common point.

	“We don’t have adequate whistleblower protections in place,” she said.


Plame likes Binney?

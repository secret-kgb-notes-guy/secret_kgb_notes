	The Trump administration has tried this a few times, sir. We actually vet these things.

	When Flynn was fired in mid-February, Trump and White House officials said that he had misled the vice president about his conversations with Kislyak, which led to an embarrassing television appearance in which an oblivious Pence defended Flynn’s conduct.

	In reality, Trump — convinced by Bannon, Priebus and Kushner — had already decided that Flynn was a liability, and was eager to find an excuse to get rid of him, according to three administration officials familiar with the episode.

contradicts Comey testimony?

	HIRONO: So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?

	COMEY: In theory yes.

	HIRONO: Has it happened?

	COMEY: Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that -- without an appropriate purpose. I mean where oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it. But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal. It's not happened in my experience.

	President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting.


This doesn't sound right


	Mr. Comey wrote the memo detailing his conversation with the president immediately after the meeting, which took place the day after Mr. Flynn resigned, according to two people who read the memo. It was part of a paper trail Mr. Comey created documenting what he perceived as the president’s improper efforts to influence a continuing investigation. An F.B.I. agent’s contemporaneous notes are widely held up in court as credible evidence of conversations.

Says Comey perceived this is an attempt to influence the investigation, but then testifies that he was never asked to shut any investigation down. So did he perceive things this way, and how?

	The Jan. 27 dinner came a day after White House officials learned that Mr. Flynn had been interviewed by F.B.I. agents about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak. On Jan. 26, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, told the White House counsel about the interview, and said Mr. Flynn could be subject to blackmail by the Russians because they knew he had lied about the content of the calls.

Moss saying Soviets feared Nixon

	In 1968, Moscow feared that the staunchly anti-communist Richard M. Nixon would be elected. To forestall that, the Kremlin decided to reach out to Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Hubert H. Humphrey. As Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan, revealed in his memoir, “In Confidence,” two decades ago: “The top Soviet leaders took an extraordinary step, unprecedented in the history of Soviet-American relations, by secretly offering Humphrey any conceivable help in his election campaign — including financial aid.” Dobrynin explained:

Nixon had his own deal versus Humphrey, not sure if he understood Soviets to be involved


would guess Soviets would want blackmail over each, Nixon only one to bite

Moss on backchannels, not sure what he's getting at exactly

	The revelation that Kushner may have requested the use of Russian secure communications is baffling. If true, the request was both unusual and unprecedented. The rationale could be as simple as a desire to keep communications with a rival power compartmentalized in the White House, it could have been a mistake of inexperience, it could have had a nefarious purpose, or it could be something else or a combination of reasons. We will not know until this is investigated, and it appears that the public won’t have to wait decades for declassification.


A weird way to approach this

not many reasons to think its true, all we have is Kislyak and Entous anonymous letter

and if it is true, its concerning, shows i.e. they are more afraid of U.S. intelligence getting their hands on their comms than Russians


	The Russians today, like their Soviet predecessors during the Cold War, will meddle when they think they can get away with it. According to Dobrynin’s memoir, “In Confidence,” the Soviet government in 1968 approached the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, to offer assistance in defeating Nixon. The Kremlin distrusted Nixon for his history of red-baiting and thought the Soviet Union could have better relations with Humphrey. To his great credit, Humphrey deflected the offer. Dobrynin was also relieved since he had advised the Kremlin against interfering with a U.S. election, because, he believed, “if discovered [it] certainly would have backfired.” Nevertheless, it did not prevent the Russians from investigating if they could get Humphrey to bite.


why does he throw this in there

	Kennedy-Nixon 1960 election clash: The last time Russians intervened in a U.S. election 

	Emily Ludolph, Narratively


Another article saying Soviets didn't like Nixon, saying they wanted to make Gary powers deal with Kennedy instead


http://narrative.ly/author/emily-ludolph/


she write anything else?


something off about this


understanding Nixon as a Russian stooge would cause a lot to unravel

But they're prading Kissinger around like they want to flaunt him

or do they?


https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-usa-kissinger-idUSKBN19L1RL
	Asked if Kissinger was providing a back-channel between the Kremlin and the White House, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "He didn't try. That did not happen." 


nobody in media freaks out about Kissinger "back-channel" between Trump and Putin

so mostly trying to keep Kissinger-KGB ties on the dl

they freak out about every alleged Trump-Putin tie except the interesting ones

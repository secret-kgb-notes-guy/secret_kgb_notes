Here is IJR op-ed lamenting Putin propaganda memes?

	Most likely, some of the memes out there were created by Putin's people, just to give more power to his brand as a strong leader. Don't scoff. It's not like he was out walking around the countryside without a shirt on and was taken by surprise by a photographer.

	“Hey, nice camera. Mind taking some action shots of me fishing...without a shirt?”

	Putin is a brilliant tactician. He knows what he's doing, as do the people around him. They know how to build a brand. They've been doing it for decades.

	He's taking over as the strong defender of freedom, because someone who inherited the role decided it wasn't for him.

	And every time I see someone fawn over Putin, like he's some sort of champion for American values, instead of the evil genius that he is, one thought comes to mind:
	THANKS OBAMA

	South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy gives something for the media to focus on besides spinning and striking out on its millionth Trump-Russia conspiracy theory to explain why Hillary Clinton lost the election.

attacking Rachel Maddow? Maddow has been focusing on lot on the Russia story, but is also partisan. So Russian propagandists could attack her and try to use her to politicize the narrative about Russia.


http://ijr.com/2017/03/819875-democrats-argue-that-russians-rigged-the-election-for-trump-so-how-do-hillary-supporters-explain-this/
	And with that ... the media was off and running. Never mind that undermining the legitimacy of the duly elected president — based on no more than indignation that the DNC happened to be illegally and wrongly hacked — was a known objective of the Kremlin all along.

accusing "the other side" of helping the Russians when he's been helping the Russians this whole time...


http://ijr.com/wildfire/2017/01/772788-latest-us-intelligence-memo-released-it-declares-russia-had-preference-for-hillary-over-trump/
	Secondly, there is still no hard evidence tying the Putin regime to the hacks released by WikiLeaks—we still have to take the intel community's word for it.

Calling for "hard evidence" when it's classified again... (linked article reads like Russian propaganda: https://medium.com/mtracey/there-is-still-no-hard-evidence-for-russian-hacking-d7e12b6429db)


	What is surprising in these intelligence memos, which the press is jumping on to undermine the legitimacy of the future president, is how little new information they actually contain.

	It is damning that the Russians' goal of dividing the nation from within is being carried out flawlessly by a U.S. media quick to jump to conclusions without the demonstrable facts.

	Russian strongman Vladimir Putin is a master at media manipulation. I've witnessed it firsthand while working as a journalist in Moscow, just blocks away from the Kremlin.

No kidding!

http://ijr.com/2016/08/663775-vladimir-putin-the-shadowy-figure-who-has-become-a-force-in-the-us-election/
	It is easy to mistake Putin's various statements about Trump—he is “talented and bright,” as well as the “absolute leader” in the race—as an endorsement. Contrary to widespread belief, however, the ex-KGB Colonel is not necessarily backing Trump, but hedging his bets in the U.S. election.

wtf is this article? says Putin is "hedging his bets" then points out how close Trump is to Putin...

Then talks about how Putin kills journalists? maybe this is a cry for help or something jesus

http://ijr.com/wildfire/2017/01/772788-latest-us-intelligence-memo-released-it-declares-russia-had-preference-for-hillary-over-trump/
	It is vital to point out what the New York Times reported following the election on this matter:

    	The Russians were as surprised as everyone else at Mr. Trump’s victory, intelligence officials said. Had Mrs. Clinton won, they believe, emails stolen from the Democratic committee and from senior members of her campaign could have been used to undercut her legitimacy. The intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia tried to help Mr. Trump was first reported by The Washington Post.

	If the Russians were calculating that Hillary Clinton was likely to win, then intelligence operations intended to harm her would necessarily be undermining her presidency; they would also exhibit a “preference” for Donald Trump.

	Once again, leakers with classified information are contacting The New York Times with stories that give the appearance of impropriety, yet that may or may not be the case. For example, the comment alluded to regarding then-candidate Trump hoping that Russian intelligence would unearth Hillary Clinton's emails is widely considered to be a joke.

He didn't mention that last time... he keeps casting doubt on Trump's ties to Russia.

	But as the American people have come to learn time and time again, the news media environment is long on accusation and innuendo but short on substantiated facts that the Trump administration has inappropriate ties to foreign governments or broke the law.

	There is an alternative explanation behind the DNC hacks, one unproven, but remotely plausible: Ukrainian hackers wanted to sabotage the DNC and Clinton campaign to make the presumed incoming President Hillary Clinton furious at the Russians. Such a turn of events would benefit the Ukraine in that it would reinvigorate U.S. foreign policy resistance to Russian territorial incursions.

Blame shifting to Ukraine? Seriously?

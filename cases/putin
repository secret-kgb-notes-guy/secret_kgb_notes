	What do you do when someone says something stupid? Well, as Brian Cox suggested to us the other day, it's best to show them up for being wrong – even if it's the Russian president.

	So, that’s what we’ll do here. Last Thursday at the International Arctic Forum in Arkhangelsk, Russia, Vladimir Putin came out with some pretty ridiculous comments about climate change.

	“What I’m about to say may be unpopular,” he began as part of an interview with CNBC. 

	“Climate change brings in more favorable conditions and improves the economic potential of this [the Arctic] region,” he said, during a panel interview with CNBC. It really won’t.

	And he added: “It isn’t about preventing global warming. I agree with those people who believe it is impossible.”

Putin says climate change is bad, but maybe good for Russia, but oh well?

weird

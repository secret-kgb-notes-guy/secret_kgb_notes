	'Our Death Toll Would Be Staggering': Judge Jeanine on Power Grid Threats

http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/03/26/exclusive-fox-news-judge-jeanine-pierro-discusses-threat-of-an-emp-attack/
	Judge Pirro has studied the subject extensively.

	...If you think that 9/11 was catastrophic–and I think it was–this would be a million times worse.

	Putin's perception of power is so strong that he took Crimea with virtually no one hurt or killed. 

	...Putin's influence in Europe and the Middle East increases. Russia is on its way to becoming the dominant world power.  And you say this??

	"Russia is a regional power that is threatening some of its immediate neighbors - not out of strength, but out of weakness."

	A regional power?  Weak?  Really?

	...And you say Russia is a regional power? With all due respect Mr. President, Putin is a pig, but he's been bitch-slapping you since the Edward Snowden mess.

	And speaking of perception, your Secret Service bozos, passing out drunk in hotel hallways traveling with you in Europe makes you look weak yet again. Do you think Putin's KGB guys would dare do something like that?  

	I suspect they can handle their Stoli better.

	At the table? Russian President Putin, not kidding around as evidenced by pro-Russian separatists, who most agree have blown a civilian plane from the sky.

	And at the table? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not kidding around, as evidenced by as many as 50,000 Israeli boots on the ground to blow up the tunnels used by Hamas terrorists to store weapons and stage attacks. 

	And on the sidelines watching and dithering, our leader, Barack Obama.

	And so after last month's Snowden humiliation, Russia's Putin just schooled the US golfer-in-chief again. Although, was there ever any doubt?

	Obama to Putin: I'll Surrender America After Re-election

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2012/03/26/obama-to-putin-ill-surrender-after-reelection/
	Russian President Vladimir Putin has humiliated President Barack Obama. He advanced soldiers into the Crimea–into the sovereign territory of Ukraine–without uniforms, in apparent violation of the laws of war. He knew that Obama would not dare complain–that the White House would, in fact, seize upon the ambiguity of the invasion as a way to pretend it had not yet happened.

	Judge Jeanine Slams Obama: 'Why Are You So Obsessed With Russia?'

	...but you're obsessed with a Russian, who at least is a Christian, who himself is obsessed with killing ISIS. A Russian who's had his own problems with Muslim terrorists, who told us twice about the Tsarnaev brother, the Boston bomber, that your Administration was too dumb to follow through on, with deadly consequences for Americans.

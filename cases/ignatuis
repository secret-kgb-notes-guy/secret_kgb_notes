figured Gates was a spy?

	Schiff said Obama had initially resisted calls to “name and shame” Russia for its hacking because the president feared it would “sow doubt about the elections” and “play into Russia’s hands by acknowledging what they were doing.” ...According to Schiff, the administration didn’t take further public steps after Oct. 7 because Obama feared it could “risk escalation, including dumping of forged documents,” in ways that would have further destabilized the election. 

haha wow

so someone's gotta ask it: Obama a Russian spy? It would make a lot of sense actually...


I think Deng Xiaoping was Okhrana?

I figure they will sometimes install spies instead of useulf idiots. I think they install useful idiots when they want to do serious damage to the target country that could get the useful idiot assassinated. So Mao and Trump are useful idiots, Deng (and maybe Obama?) are not.


anyway seems like a pretty reasonable, insightful article

	The White House thought it was making progress with a joint statement at the November 2015 G-20 summit in Antalya, Turkey, which affirmed that “international law applies to state behavior in cyberspace.”


laws only work if people think they're worth following...


good article

Ignatius seems to generally know his shit

	Now, says Stengel, social media give everyone the opportunity to construct their own narrative of reality. He recalls the early days of the Islamic State in 2014, when extremists used brutal imagery to terrorize people and recruit followers. The State Department’s early counter-radicalization efforts mistakenly were “tit for tat,” arguing with jihadists’ interpretation of Islam. A better strategy, U.S. officials learned, was to empower others who could make the case more effectively. 


Interesting

makes sense, isn't that what the Okhrana does?

Ideas spread


	The best hope may be the global companies that have created the social-media platforms. “They see this information war as an existential threat,” says Stengel. The tech companies have made a start: He says Twitter has removed more than 400,000 accounts, and YouTube daily deletes extremist videos.

	The real challenge for global tech giants is to restore the currency of truth. Perhaps “machine learning” can identify falsehoods and expose every argument that uses them. Perhaps someday, a human-machine process will create what Stengel describes as a “global ombudsman for information.


could explain why Okhrana hates Google and Facebook

calling Clinton a liar and actually giving her some advice

	Running from the center in a polarized country has its risks, to be sure. But Clinton’s current strategy, a sort of Bernie Sanders Lite, doesn’t seem to be working very well, even against a radically unqualified GOP opponent.

	Military prosecutors had already opened a case into Wang Jianping, a deputy chief of the joint staff department under the powerful Central Military Commission, ministry spokesman Yang Yujun told a monthly news briefing.

	He gave no other details.

	It was not possible to reach Wang for comment and unclear if he had been allowed to retain a lawyer.

	Hong Kong's South China Morning Post said in August Wang had been taken into custody in Chengdu in southwestern Sichuan province, with his wife and secretary also detained.

	As head of the 2.3 million-strong armed forces, President Xi Jinping has made his fight against military corruption a top priority, with officers warning that the problem is so pervasive it could undermine China's ability to wage war at a time when Beijing has increasingly projected its influence in the region and surrounding seas.

	The People's Liberation Army is already reeling from Xi's anti-corruption campaign, which has seen dozens of officers investigated and jailed, including Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, both former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission.

	Xu died of cancer before he could appear in court.

	Wang previously worked closely with former Chinese domestic security tzar Zhou Yongkang, who was jailed for life in 2015 in one of the country's biggest corruption scandals in decades.

	From 2009 to 2014, Wang commanded the paramilitary People's Armed Police, reporting directly to Zhou.

Looks like they caught a military coup?

	Owing to the far-reaching impact Zhou's case would have on the party as well as the potential for intra-party conflict, Xi also reportedly sought the blessing of former General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao as well as other 'party elders'. Jiang was said to have met with Xi several times in Beijing between June and July to discuss Zhou Yongkang.[41] During these meetings, Xi was said to have directly elaborated to Jiang on Zhou's alleged crimes, as well as convincing Jiang of the potential harm to the party and the state if Zhou were not brought down. Jiang, though initially reluctant, eventually threw his weight behind Xi. Jiang subsequently applauded Xi's leadership skills during a visit by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

So does Kissinger have anything to do with this?

	As recently as December, when then US president-elect Donald Trump threatened upheaval between the world’s most powerful nations, by accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen, Kissinger was already in Beijing with Chinese president Xi Jinping, reassuring him that “overall, we hope to see the China-US relationship moving ahead in a sustained and stable manner.” (A Bloomberg report suggested that Xi may have turned to the venerable diplomat to better understand Trump, telling Kissinger he was “all ears” regarding what he had to say about the future of US-China relations.)

	Kissinger met with the incoming Trump administration soon after the election, and helped to connect Chinese politicians with the US president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Washington Post reports—connections that ultimately led to this week’s meeting.

	In doing so, he’s opened up a now familiar controversy in the US—who does Kissinger work for, exactly, and whose side is he on?

ya right no kidding. I guess he's sort of above alliegience to any state?


	Kissinger is “representing China’s interests and trying to influence American foreign policy,” said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a nonpartisan group that advocates for citizens’ rights in Congress. “That crosses the threshold for FARA,” he said, referring to the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

	Kissinger’s 600-page 2011 book “On China” is a bible for foreign businessmen and diplomats trying to work out political and trade deals in China, and it reads like the antithesis of the Trump administration’s approach to China so far, and a clue, perhaps, to Xi’s stance. As the New Republic review of the book summarizes:

    	Rather than attempt to crush an opponent with superior force, traditional thinkers in China “placed a premium on victory through psychological advantage and preached the avoidance of direct conflict.” The Chinese approach to strategy has always stressed “subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage.”

I mean the Russians read Sun Tzu too...

Is China the new Germany?

It isn't clear how much China and Russia are coordinating and to what end.

A lot depends on their level of influence in China.

If they are attempting to fool intel agencies as well, would be very hard to say whether or not this is a cover (e.g. another fake Sino-Russian split).

One way or another they clearly want the U.S. public to dislike China.

Would they actually expect the U.S. public to blame China for Russia's activities (e.g. "China is the new Germany"). Seems like no, since as Comey says they were "loud" in their operations and Trump is in love with Putin. I guess they could try to frame China though?


https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/12/22/henry-kissinger-and-cheng-li-express-cautious-optimism-about-u-s-china-relations-in-the-trump-xi-era/
	Beyond the bilateral relationship, Kissinger and Li also agreed that Russia will play an outsized role in a Trump presidency. Li suggested that the new administration presents an opportunity to promote a new paradigm—originally proposed by Kissinger years ago—that has recently been repackaged by Stanford historian Niall Ferguson as “the new American-Chinese-Russian tripartite arrangement.” As Li explained further:

	“this does not necessarily mean that the U.S. should use Russia to contain China or use China to deal with Russia. The fact is that all three countries face the same daunting challenges of terrorist attacks, nuclear proliferation, and cyberspace insecurity. There may be a real opportunity for these three countries to appreciate their shared interests in responding to common challenges and thus searching for a new world order.” 

So what does this mean? China and Russia team up to use Trump to destroy the West?

	The U.S.-Russia relationship was also raised in the context Rex Tillerson’s nomination to serve as secretary of state, the post Kissinger once held. Kissinger praised Tillerson, explaining:

	“I pay no attention to this argument that he’s too friendly to Russia. As head of Exxon, it’s his job to get along with Russia. He would be useless as head of Exxon if he did not have a working relationship with Russia. We should not think about these relationships as the personal relationship of individuals.”

Does Kissinger expect anybody to believe him? What's Xi's take on all this?

Why did Soros write an op-ed saying the U.S. should ally with China against Russia?

	The second prediction was that the corruption crackdown would intensify and at least one more Zhou Yongkang-level tiger would go down, as would at least one member of the “red nobility”.

	Other prominent figures who have taken advantage of offshore companies include the brother-in-law of the president, Xi Jinping, and the son-in-law of Zhang Gaoli, another member of China’s top political body, the politburo standing committee.

Panama papers a U.S. op?

http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/04/05/china-shuts-online-discussion-panama-papers/
	The Irish Times notes that the most prominent mention of the Panama Papers in Chinese state-run media was an article in the Global Times, portraying them as a dirty trick by Western press, eager to slander such leaders as Russian President Vladimir Putin by disclosing the details of his $2 billion money-laundering operation.

	“The Western media has taken control of the interpretation each time there has been such a document dump, and Washington has demonstrated particular influence in it,” thundered the Global Times editors. “Information that is negative to the US can always be minimised, while exposure of non-Western leaders, such as Putin, can get extra spin.”

Fascinating... trying to say the panama papers were more damaging to China than Russia?

https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/06/panama-papers-reveal-offshore-secrets-china-red-nobility-big-business
	Since Monday, China’s censors have been blocking access to the unfolding revelations about its most senior political families. There are now reports of censors deleting hundreds of posts on the social networks Sina Weibo and Wechat, and some media organisations including CNN say parts of their websites have been blocked.

So they censor criticism of these guys but not others.

	Former premier Li Peng is known by his detractors as the “butcher of Beijing” for his part in the bloody crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. In 1994, a BVI company called Cofic Investments Limited, ultimately owned by his daughter Li Xiaolin, was incorporated.

	Her fortune has been estimated at $550m, and she has made a name as China’s “power queen” after a career spent running electricity-generating businesses. She is vice-president of state-owned power group China Datang Corporation.

	Li is noted in China for conspicuous consumption – her appearance in a pink Pucci trouser suit at the annual meeting of a top government advisory body prompted a widely shared social media post that suggested the 12,000 yuan (£1,300) price tag was equivalent to warm clothes for 200 poor children. 

Sounds familiar. Is Russia doing social media manipulation in China too? or was this them? or do they have high-level political influence there? or is it a more international "mafia-style" organization like early Okhrana?

Probably not enough time to figure it all out right now...


https://sinocism.com/remarks-at-a-december-2015-panel-at-the-kissinger-institute-on-china-and-the-united-states/
	The crackdown has intensified, Xu Caihou, Guo Boxiong, Su Rong, Zhou Benshun and many other fallen officials if they could talk would probably tell you that, but so far no one else at Zhou’s level or any of the “red nobility” have been taken out. I still think it will happen, these things are very politically complex and I do not subscribe to the reductionist view that the crackdown is just about power consolidation, but time will tell. In the meantime, I challenge you to find any red nobility or princelings who have not significantly changed their behavior in the face of this crackdown.

This doesn't sound good...

	The Trump-Xi meeting at Mar-a-Lago is on for next week, though Xi is apparently not staying at Mar-a-Lago but rather at the Eau Palm Beach Resort and Spa in Manalapan.

Have the Mar-a-Lago staffers thought about creating a membership plan and/or marketing push just for PRC citizens?

http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/08/propaganda-drive-in-china-as-cartoon-xi-jinping-plays-whack-a-mole.html
 	Released over the weekend, the clip from the Communist Party of China is the latest in a string of propaganda videos aimed to appeal to a younger generation less likely to be enticed by the rousing "red songs" of yore.

	In his latest cartoon incarnation, Xi is shown cracking down on corrupt officials with a mallet as the narrator lists the officials who have been targeted – former state security chief Zhou Yongkang and political star Bo Xilai among them.

	... Both Zhou and Bo were once high fliers in the establishment who have since been sentenced to life for corruption and abuse of power.

	The five in the cartoon were featured in tiger costumes in a reference to Xi's drive to crack down on both "tigers" or powerful leaders and "flies" i.e. lowly bureaucrats.

	The video also features a cartoon version of "coolest foreigner" former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger, praising Xi's anti-graft efforts in Mandarin—complete with a foreign accent.


This doesn't sound good...

Maybe the coup was an excuse to conslidate power, kindof like the coup in Turkey?

Clearly they want to foment conflict between the U.S. and China. Trump's taiwan actions for example.

You also see in U.S. culture a build-up of fear/mistrust against China along with seeing Russia as allies. Possibly the same happening in China? They did build that giant war statue with some in U.S. media claiming it is a provocation against the U.S.

Fomenting conflict between China and the U.S. would be in their interests, especially if they could control both sides.

Gady epstein and the "democratization research" would also be seen as threatening to China. And Russia could do influence ops in China and blame on the U.S. and the U.S. and blame on China, which seems to be going on now at least on the U.S. side.

Still the question of how high their influence is in China. Is it around the level in U.S.? higher?

https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/henry-kissinger-we-must-destroy-the-chongqing-model.167211/
	Henry Kissinger: We must destroy the Chongqing Model 

	2. What is most fearful for us, is China's unity. The unity of leadership, the unity of political and economic elites, the economic elites using donations to gain public approval, the bending of the economic elite's will towards the political elite... there is no doubt that this sort of stability and unity can lead to China's growing strategic space, encroach on US strategic space, and in the future Sino-US conflict, emerge as victor. The failing Wall Street Model is already dragging down Western economies. China in the next 5 years will have the ability to directly face off with the US. The US must suppress China in this time. Only through this can we have a hope of slowing down China's development.

If this is true then interesting. More fomenting distrust and conflict between China and the U.S.

Yet China Communist party says Kissinger is "the coolest foreigner?" I don't get it.

Comparing China purge to Nazis.. ok...
	
	Xi Jinping is also going to personally chair and oversee the shadow banking reform committee. Normally this is chaired by the Premier or a more junior official, so it seems a clear signal that Beijing intends to get its shadow bank lending under direct control. Li Keqiang, in a speech in March, indicated a willingness to allow “selective” corporate defaults, no doubt as an instrument to rein in state enterprises, control power, implement reform and settle scores. Unless it fits one of the four following categories, stimulus and bailouts would be small.

So saying the crackdown was a power grab.

Still a question of who came out on top of the crackdown? One would think there would be Okhrana elements in China and anti-Okhrana elements (or otherwise pro-China). Who won?

This propaganda gives a negative connotation of it, but again it looks like they want the U.S. to see China as hopelessly corrupt and authoritarian, whether that's true or not...

https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol.-56-no.-3/pdfs/Mattis-Understanding%20Chinese%20Intel.pdf

Chinese intel like Russia mixes domestic and foreign intel, influences politics, but differs from Russia in some ways.

	For at least the past 15 years, 
China has appeared precariously 
unstable; various sources have noted 
mounting unrest—now well over 
100,000 “mass incidents” per year.
11
Reports and photographs of violent 
demonstrations in various places 
have given rise to analysis that “Bei-
jing’s control over the coercive sys-
tem, as well as that system’s 
capacity to maintain social control, 
appears to be slipping.”

Where are these coming from? sounds like the kind of thing Okhrana would do I guess

Yongkang wanted a power-grab with MPS?

Beginning with Sun 
Tzu, Chinese strategists have envi-
sioned a seamless web of counteres-
pionage, information collection, 
agent provocateurs, and propagan-
dists—what Sun Tzu called the 
“divine skein.”

...

The largely unchronicled rise of the 
MPS during the past decade suggests Meng and his predecessor Zhou 
Yongkang are largely responsible for 
reforming the MPS and raising the 
profile of “social management” and 
“preserving stability.”

http://rbth.com/opinion/2017/03/28/does-russias-1990s-privatization-hold-any-lessons-for-china_728996
Gabuev also mentioned the famous case of Zhou Yongkang, a former Politburo Standing Committee member who was indicted for corruption during the first years of Xi Jinping’s leadership. “Zhou Yongkang’s case echoes the illegal practices of Russian privatization in the 90s, when state assets were sold for a low price to dummy corporations,” he said.

Zhou also used to be the powerful kingpin of China’s state energy sector, with his allies owning over $14 billion worth of assets in China and overseas. After 2 years of investigation, Zhou was sentenced to life in prison for corruption and was deprived of all of his former privileges.

Zhou’s case bears an uncanny resemblance to the infamous loans-for-shares auctions in Russia in the mid-1990s. During these auctions, state property was sold at an undervalued price, and competition between the various bidders was practically non-existent.

“Russia’s privatization experience is exactly how China should not operate,” Gabuev added.

It seems that China’s bureaucrats already know how to carry out “Russian-style” privatization schemes. However, with Xi Jinping’s current high-profile anti-corruption campaign going on, China could learn a lesson from Russia’s experience and do the exact opposite of its northern counterpart in dealing with state-sector reforms

hmm

wonder if coup is a kindof fake-out? make China think Russian influence is thwarted, but generally they would like to control both sides of any conflict. Yongkang seemed almost too Maoist?

Seems like they are trying a similar thing in the U.S.. Their propagandists on the left generally focus on Page and Manafort but ignore Kissinger and Prince, and others. Maybe try to say "see Russian influence is incompetent that's all it was" while continuing to grab power. Like the perestroika deception.

	But Democrats have attacked Mr. Trump’s Russia policy mainly as a partisan weapon. Their criticism is aimed not at reversing his dangerous approach towards Russia, but undermining his political clout and legitimacy. Seeing Russia policy primarily through the lens of domestic politics, in turn, serves to trivialize it and weakens calls for what should be a serious debate about what kind of Russia policy best serves American interests. 

politicizing it?

	While there is little evidence that Russian meddling tipped America’s 2016 presidential election, Mr. Trump’s silence and the Democrats’ political use of Russia’s provocations serve Moscow’s interest. Containing Russia requires American strategic consensus. Absent that, Mr. Putin will continue playing what is objectively a weak economic and military hand to maximum effect.

	A truly bipartisan policy would enable Congress, among other things, to end sequestration so that the U.S. military can have sufficient resources to contain Russia. Resisting Russian intimidation should be more than a campaign slogan. While almost no one wants a return to the Cold War, a world in which Russian hegemony is unrestrained increases the chance of global conflict.

sounds like propaganda

	Although not yet put directly in the Night of the Long Knives list, there is enough of a purge of the military underway to keep those actors in line and wary. Xi compares it to going after tigers and flies. These are indeed scary times for the corrupt kleptocrats of China.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-29/paul-craig-roberts-worries-what-henry-kissinger
So what, foment conflict between China and the U.S. and blame it on the "neocons"?

Whatever is going on, Russia tries to gain "closer ties" with other nations by deception and blackmail. So the relationship between China and Russia could be strained as with the U.S., maybe in similar ways. 

Assuming Xi doesn't work for them (I mean it doesn't look like it? and that would be risky I guess), it looks like Russia is trying the usual carrot/stick "diplomacy" with Xi, maybe talking up opportunities to "work together" to undermine the U.S. while putting out threats of consequences if they don't.

From Kissinger, sounds like plan would be to convince Trump and diplo circles that Russia, China, and U.S. are "freinds," then get Trump involved in war or proxy war with China.

not really sure but that seems like the stategy that makes sense and that they would try, although their propaganda narrative around China is confusing sometimes.

Public facing propaganda regarding China is just about always negative, so conflict is clearly something they want (or to keep the option of open), regardless of their level of influence in China.

ya ok so Bo did the "anti-corruption crackdown that's really just a powergrab" thing first.

Tried to revive Maoism? weird.

	Cheng Li, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said that "Nobody really trusts [Bo]: a lot of people are scared of him, including several princelings who are supposed to be his power base."[24]

What's up with Cheng Li? I thought he was Okhrana? or was that someone else..

	In early 2012, the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection bolstered its presence within Chongqing as the city's leaders came under investigation. Much of the attention focused on Bo's police chief, Wang Lijun, who may have been under investigation for his role in a corruption case in Liaoning. Growing scrutiny over the city's wiretapping operation against senior leaders also likely fell mainly on Wang.[72] Although details are scarce, several sources have suggested that Wang's resentment against Bo grew amidst the investigations—resentment that was compounded when Wang realized that he and his wife had also been targets of wiretapping under Bo's orders

	...On 26 October, the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress expelled him as a deputy to the national legislature, removing his final public post and setting the stage for his trial.[102] When he was ejected from the Communist Party, the official announcement also mentioned that he had "had or maintained improper sexual relations with multiple women." Rumors also spread that he had an affair with the star actress of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Zhang Ziyi; Zhang racked up significant legal bills attempting to sue the sources of the rumour for defamation.[103] During the trial, Bo admitted that he had fallen out with his wife because of an affair he had in the 1990s, prompting her to move to the United Kingdom to be near their son, Guagua

Some Kompromat on Bo?

	Bo's downfall elicited strong reactions among the Chinese public and with commentators across the political spectrum.[105] Leftist websites such as Utopia, Red China, and Maoflag were full of angry commentary over Bo's dismissal. These websites were shut down for a period of "maintenance" shortly after.[105][106] Leftist commentators voiced support for Bo: Kong Qingdong called Bo's dismissal 'a plot by enemies of the state'; Sima Nan said associating Bo with the Cultural Revolution was a 'smear campaign';[107] Sima's pro-Bo microblogs were censored.[106] Large numbers of sympathetic posts for Bo appeared in microblogs from Chongqing, and Dalian, where Bo was once mayor.[105][108] The Global Times also wrote a sympathetic editorial. Liberal media reacted positively, criticizing Bo's style of 'personality-based rule' as dangerous and regressive.[109] Right-leaning commentators said Bo's downfall signified a 'correct orientation' to China's future development.[109] Southern Media Group editor Yan Lieshan remarked that Bo correctly identified China's problems but prescribed the wrong solution.[109] Businesspeople whose assets were seized by Bo's administration in Chongqing also reacted positively.[105]

	Bo's dismissal caused political shockwaves unseen since the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989,[99][110] and exposing internal conflicts within Communist Party. In the weeks following 15 March, party authorities deliberated on Bo's case.[111] In the absence of official reports of the proceedings, microblogs churned out a flood of speculation, including rumours of a coup.[112] In response, the authorities instructed newspapers and websites to strictly report only official releases, and arrested six people accused of 'rumourmongering'

	Aware of its potentially divisive impact, authorities carefully controlled media coverage of Bo's removal from office. 

I wonder if Bo was supposed to be like their Hillary Clinton? someone corrupt to divide the country.

	A few days before the trial, Wang Xuemei, a prominent forensic scientist who was vice director of the Chinese Forensic Medicine Association and of the Supreme Court's Prosecutorial Research Center, resigned from her positions. Wang had publicly questioned the forensic evidence used in the trial of Bo's wife Gu Kailai.

A similar effect to Clinton maybe? help reduce trust in the government

Didn't Nixon have a similar effect?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Yongkang#cite_note-wangya-44
	By Spring 2014, it became increasingly clear that Zhou's spheres of influence – the oil sector, Sichuan, the legal system, and his family members – were being methodically rounded up for investigation. However, in the absence of any official reports on Zhou himself, Chinese and international media became rife with speculation about his fate. At a press conference during the March 2014 national meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a reporter from Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post directly asked the spokesperson if he could provide more information on the rumours circulating about the Zhou Yongkang case. In response, the spokesman chuckled and said, "like you, I've seen some stories on a select few media outlets," he then recited a prepared party-line reply, then ended off his response with a smile, "this is really all I can say in response to your question, I think you know what I mean." (你懂的)[N 4][48] Afterwards the assembled press gallery burst into laughter.

Right so basically the guy tried a coup and got stomped

	...On July 29, 2014, state media formally announced an internal party investigation against Zhou Yongkang's "violations of party discipline", but did not mention any criminal wrongdoing.[50] Several months later, the party investigation concluded that Zhou abused his power for the illicit gain of his family, friends, and associates, took "large amounts in bribes personally and through his family and associates; abused his power to further the interests of his family, mistresses, and associates; committed adultery with multiple women and engaged in the exchange of money and favours for sex; and leaked state and party secrets.

So Zhou supported Bo was was definitly corrupt, official story on what Zhou was charged with sounds bogus but he may or may not have tried a coup.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four
	Their downfall on October 6, 1976, a mere month after Mao's death, brought about major celebrations on the streets of Beijing and marked the end of a turbulent political era in China.

Did China win back some independence here?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong
	Although Soviet and Comintern delegates attended, the first congress ignored Lenin's advice to accept a temporary alliance between the Communists and the "bourgeois democrats" who also advocated national revolution; instead they stuck to the orthodox Marxist belief that only the urban proletariat could lead a socialist revolution

Sounds like Mao was a "true believer?" possibly a useful idiot? hard to say

	As the Communists awaited Chiang's arrival, he loosed the White Terror, massacring 5000 with the aid of the Green Gang.[84][87] In Beijing, 19 leading Communists were killed by Zhang Zuolin.[88][89] That May, tens of thousands of Communists and those suspected of being communists were killed, and the CPC lost approximately 15,000 of its 25,000 members

Interesting that Green Gang helped Chaing massacre the communists. I had thought they would be tied to the Okhrana. Chiang also had some sketchy ties.

Actually, was Chaing advised by Okhrana? He was clearly amoral as well as making a lot of mistakes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong
	Likewise, the Soviet Union gave quasi-covert support to Mao by their occupation of north east China, which allowed the PLA to move in en masse and take large supplies of arms left by the Japanese's Kwantung Army.


	...The extent of Mao's knowledge of the severity of the situation has been disputed. Mao's physician believed that he may have been unaware of the extent of the famine, partly due to a reluctance to criticise his policies, and the willingness of his staff to exaggerate or outright fake reports regarding food production.[185] Upon learning of the extent of the starvation, Mao vowed to stop eating meat, an action followed by his staff.

So what's the deal? was Mao just an idiot and Stalin used him to destroy China? Or did he know what he was doing here (like his own Holodomor?)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine
	Until the early 1980s, the Chinese government's stance, reflected by the name "Three Years of Natural Disasters", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors.

	...Along with collectivization, the central government decreed several changes in agricultural techniques based on the ideas of Soviet pseudoscientist Trofim Lysenko

wow, sounds like it was targetted at all of China...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor
	During the Holodomor millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine.

Holodomor was genocide of Ukrainians I take it?

So was the Chinese Famine genocide of the Chinese?

War, famine, pestilence...

they do like their occult stuff I guess?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko
	His experimental research in improved crop yields earned him the support of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, especially following the famine and loss of productivity resulting from resistance to forced collectivization in several regions of the Soviet Union in the early 1930s. 

So was this guy the excuse/method for famine?

	Another policy (known as "deep plowing") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal plowing depths of 15–20 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and again severely stunting seedling growth.

wtf

	Frank Dikötter argues that most floods were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed irrigation works which were part of the Great Leap Forward.[5]

so this is what happens when they take over your country?

Just like with Trump "I can't believe our crumbling infrastructure." meanwhile they have sabotures everywhere. Like that damn evacuation out of nowhere. They were planning that in the 60's too.

	Amartya Sen puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: "Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country—no matter how poor." 

???

who is this guy?

https://scroll.in/article/823132/a-leading-industrialist-explains-why-demonetisation-is-such-a-genius-idea

	Sure, people like Larry Summers, Kaushik Basu, Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman are ruining our demonetisation buzz with their negative outlook, but what do these guys know about economics?

I've heard three of these names before...

Sen seems suspicious

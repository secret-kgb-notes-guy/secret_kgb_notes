	Is a techno-utopian civilization our future or will inadequacy, info-glut, and indecision prevail? A survey is underway on TechCast.org, a virtual think tank of over 100 experts providing technology forecasts to companies, asking what people think about the financial and ecological crises threatening the world and to evaluate four alternative scenarios ranging from most pessimistic to optimistic as potential outcomes.

	William E. Halal, Prof Emeritus, George Washington University, author, and president of TechCast, and Michael Marien a former editor at World Future Society came up with four scenarios for the future: “Decline to Disaster”, “Muddling Down”, “Muddling Up”, and, “Rise to Maturity.” They have dueling viewpoints on the issue (Halal's take is upbeat, whereas Marien's is not) which is why they're asking experts what they think. The Global Megacrisis is the confluence of climate change, peak oil & energy shortages, environmental pollution, armed conflict, terrorism, and other threats.

	I spoke recently with Halal about the Global Megacrisis and the future of technology.


some kind of futurism mumbo-jumbo?

	People are preoccupied with negativity and we are in a state of gridlock. The country can’t do much if it is polarized politically.   But information technology is exploding and it’s changing the world dramatically. In ten years artificial intelligence is going to be good enough to automate routine human thought, and it’s going to raise awareness to the next stage of social evolution—consciousness. Right now we focus on knowledge, but next we'll move beyond knowledge to focus on values, beliefs, and ideologies—all of the things that are major obstacles, or blockages to progress today. That’s the way evolution always moves. A new capability evolves to address the challenges that limit further progress.

	Organizational  intelligence  (OIQ)  is  similar  to  individual IQ  but  framed  at  the  organizational  level  (Halal,  1997).

	Take a fascinating glimpse into the not-too-distant future. In The Infinite Resource, seventeen visionary thinkers explore knowledge--the only inexhaustible source of competitive advantage--as the juggernaut of an remarkable new order whose advent is fast rAndering today's business conventions obsolete. Their incisive observations include up-to-the-minute examinations of knowledge-change initiatives currently under way at Bell Atlantic, MCI, Lufthansa, and other forward-thinking companies. Filled with fresh ideas, perspectives, and voices, it's a state-of-the-art appraisal of emerging organizational forms vital to anyone grappling with the challenges and possibilities posed by the Information Age.

Some kind of book on managment, "knowledge enterprise" seems like mumbo-jumbo? can't tell what the book is about by the cover, who knows


https://www.amazon.com/William-E.-Halal/e/B001H9TFTA

Has a bunch of cheap spacey-sounding management books

management is a science that would be easy to spread pseudoscience in, no?

harder to have falsifiable experiements

	We live in a changing world of exploding complexity, struggling to adapt to a confluence of crises like climate change, energy, financial instability, political gridlock, terrorism, etc.. Today’s institutions, living habits, educational systems—and the very ideas, values, and beliefs that support all this—are increasingly outmoded.  The key to making the transition to a sustainable world lies in such small, everyday shifts in individual consciousness, and a few big shifts too

what does that even mean

	Consider some long-term benefits of America’s soft power policies:

	SYRIA  The slaughter of civilians goes on, but Obama may be wise not to get sucked into what looks like a great civil war between Shiites and Sunnis. Putin has earned the condemnation of the world by helping Assad continue the slaughter, while Obama eliminated chemical weapons in Syria without firing a shot.

	IRAN  After decades of futile sword rattling by American hawks, Obama’s policy of engagement has finally brought Iran to the bargaining table, and it looks like a solution may be possible.

	UKRAINE  Putin may be enjoying his display of bravado, but he has demonstrated that Russia remains a backward nation bent on cold war violence. Apart from the energy companies rushing to tap Russia’s gas and oil, who would want to invest in an economy based on extractive industries, corruption, and force? In contrast, Obama’s patient use of sanctions has taken the air out of Putin’s sails and avoided escalation.

	 Blog: Future May Depend on Learning to Develop a Global Conscience
	May 19, 2016

	By the year 2040, we can expect to have general artificial intelligence comparable to humans, according to William Halal, chairman of TechCast Global. “By 2020, a $1,000 computer will have the power of the brain," he predicted. Speaking on a panel at the AFCEA International/George Mason University Critical Issues in C4I Symposium, Halal went on to ask, “What happens to all the people whose jobs will be replaced as a result?"

	...According to Halal, the next logical step beyond knowledge is a global consciousness of values, beliefs, ideology and choices. He says a movement will begin to go beyond knowledge in the face of a global mega crisis and also will involve the restructuring of institutions.

	The global mega crisis will occur, Halal said, when a confluence of threats, such as climate change, energy and water shortages, financial system collapse and terrorism, converge. Most people do not believe these issues can be solved because of a lack of leadership and vision. Addressing the biggest challenge of civilization will require different forms of consciousness and thinking.

	The constant drumbeat of cascading business failures is certainly daunting, but the truly frightening thing is that the financial meltdown is part of a larger â€śglobal crisis of maturityâ€ť â€“ energy shortages, climate change, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and other yet unforeseen threats that are straining old systems to the breaking point. These are all interrelated elements of a failing global order that increasingly looks like a train wreck in slow motion.

he just lists all the things the Okhrana are doing...

	If not sub-prime mortgages, some other flaw in todayâ€™s aging economic system would likely have caused roughly the same failures. Just as the collapse of Communism resulted from an over-controlled planned economy, todayâ€™s â€ścollapse of Capitalismâ€ť is the result of an under-controlled market economy.

The failures cut across all sectors of society to announce the end of the Reagan Revolution that
began  with  his  election  in  1980.  The  Iraq  war  demonstrated  the  limits  of  military  power,  and  the
financial  crisis  the  limits  of  free  markets  single-mindedly  focused  on  profit-making.  Bush's
response  to  the  Katrina  disaster  in  New  Orleans  highlighted  the  problem  of  unresponsive  govern-
ment run by the old boy network. The sacred trust that banks depend on was shattered when a flood
of shoddy mortgages brought down the financial markets, while the corrupting money of corporate
lobbyists  greased  the  palms  of  politicians  to  avert  their  eyes.  And  the  reigning  culture  of  con-
sumerism was dealt a symbolic blow when shoppers rushing into K-Mart for bargains trampled an
employee  to  death.  Even  that  most  revered  symbol  of  success  –  multimillion  dollar  incomes  –  is
being questioned for the first time I can recall.
We
are  likely  to  see  more  failures  as  the  old  system  topples  slowly  over  the  next  few  years.
W
ith the constraints of a collapsing world order and Nature's hard reality pressing in, the excesses
of the industrial age will be sloughed off like an animal shedding its outworn skin. The middle class
seems  to  be  in  charge  now,  quietly  threatening  to  revolt  against  outmoded  practices  that  have  left
them out of the enormous wealth the rich have gained, so anything is possible. The recovery may be
long  and  difficult,  but  this  pivotal  event  could  serve  to  address  these  profound  institutional  short-
comings. 
W
arnings  of  massive  transformations  have  been  anticipated  for  decades  by  the  Club  of  Rome
and  many  other  futurists.  Now,  however,  all  of  the  concerns  that  we  were  forewarned  of  over  the
past few decades are at hand. The future has finally arrived – with a vengeance.

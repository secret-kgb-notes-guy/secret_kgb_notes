	“He is the poster child for the professional, competent, ethical and fair-minded prosecutor,” said defense lawyer Robert C. Bonsib, a former state and federal prosecutor. 

	...A few years later, Philip B. Heymann, deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, was looking for someone to serve as counsel. A career prosecutor whose judgment he trusted recommended Rosenstein.

	...In the mid-1990s, Rosenstein landed in the middle of one of the most high-profile cases in years. Kenneth W. Starr named him to the team of prosecutors handling the Whitewater investigation into Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Arkansas business dealings.

Sessions and Rosenstein discussed firing Comey as early as last winter, Sessions and Rosensteins reasons disagree




http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/18/rod-rosenstein-james-coming-senators-briefing-238562
	Rod Rosenstein already knew James Comey was going to be fired as FBI director when he wrote the three-page memo that the White House would later assert had sealed Comey’s fate, multiple senators said Thursday as they left a highly-anticipated briefing with the deputy attorney general.

	Rosenstein learned Comey was being ousted on May 8, according to Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), but the memo is dated May 9 — the day the firing took place.

	“It was very clear that he learned before he wrote the memo that Comey was going to be removed,” added Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). “Somebody made a decision to remove Comey before he wrote the memo.”

	Rosenstein declined to say who asked him to write the memo, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said.

So the memo was an excuse to fire Comey, Rosenstein obliged


	“He said over and over again that Mueller is going to draw the scope of this investigation, that Mueller is going to have the resources, that Mueller is not going to be interfered with by him or the Department of Justice,” Durbin said.

	Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the briefing made clear to him the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s election meddling had transitioned from being a counterintelligence probe to being a full-fledged criminal probe.

	"It was a counterintelligence investigation until now," Graham told reporters. "It seems to me now to be considered a criminal investigation."

now clearly a criminal investigation according to Graham

	And Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said it was a "good question" why the briefing was even held because he learned so little, adding that the only thing he took away was how to pronounce Rosenstein's name correctly.

Rosenstein says Comey shouldn't have gone public about Clinton email case, broke rules.

	In response to skeptical question at a congressional hearing, the Director defended his remarks by saying that his "goal was to say what is true. What did we do, what did we find, what do we think about it." But the goal of a federal criminal investigation is not to announce our thoughts at a press conference.

Isn't it department policy to comment on cases of exceptional public interest?

So he's basically saying Comey broke protocol and tradition with statement on Clinton email case and the letter. Nothing particularly controversial. Although clearly not something Trump would agree with...

Then goes on to cite former Justice people who disagree with Comey as justification to fire:

Laurence Silberman, Jamie Gorelick, Larry Thompson, Michael Mukasey, Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder, Donald Ayer.

	Although the President has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former Department officials. The way the Director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong.

	As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.

	Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein knew James B. Comey was about to be fired before writing his scathing memo to President Trump about the FBI director, senators said Thursday.

	Rosenstein was briefing senators at a closed-door meeting at the Capitol in the aftermath of Comey's firing and his own appointment of a special prosecutor to probe Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's possible connection to that interference.

	"He knew that Comey was going to be removed prior to writing his memo," Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) told reporters after emerging from the session.

	"He knew the day before," said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. "On May 8 he learned."

	However, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida did not come to the same conclusion.  

	"I’m not sure he addressed that with a level of clarity," Rubio said.

Rosenstein also involved in Whitewater prosecution, sounds like key player?

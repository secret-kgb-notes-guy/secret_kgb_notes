 	Trump ends relationship with longtime political adviser Roger Stone 


	...“I terminated Roger Stone last night because he no longer serves a useful function for my campaign,” Trump added. “I really don’t want publicity seekers who want to be on magazines or who are out for themselves. This campaign is not about them. It’s about victory and making America great again.”

	...The timeline for Stone’s exit from Trump’s inner circle is disputed. Trump insisted that he and Stone, who have been quarrelling for weeks over Trump’s political strategy, was “fired” late Friday after Trump heard from associates about Stone’s grumblings over Trump’s behavior and Trump’s refusal to take his advice ahead of Thursday’s GOP debate in Cleveland. In a phone call Saturday, Stone “categorically denied” being fired.


Trump fired him, but why exactly?


	...Trump’s CNN interview Friday evening instantly drew criticism after he said Kelly, one of the moderators of Thursday’s Republican presidential debate in Cleveland, “had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”


what an asshole

	In another interview with CBS News, Stone added that he resigned for "constructive reasons."

	"We don't have time for political correctness," Stone told CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman. "But the campaign seems to have run into a cul-de-sac and I'm disappointed by the lack of specificity put forward by the campaign today."

	Stone contended that the campaign "has gotten seriously off message" and relied on "unscientific polls" with "no value."

	A source close to Stone told Business Insider that he was distraught at the escalation of feuds with media figures like Kelly while policy plans and issue papers sat on a shelf, still unapproved by Trump.


true? doesn't seem like him

	Stone is a veteran Republican strategist who once worked for President Richard Nixon, and has been one of Trump's closest confidantes for a lengthy period of time. He was the chairman of Trump's exploratory presidential committee in 2000, and a source close to Stone said they have been friends for about 35 years. Costa described Stone as Trump's "longest serving adviser."


hmmm

	After Nunberg's firing, anonymous allies of his told multiple media outlets they believed Lewandowski was somehow responsible for the Business Insider story about his Facebook posts. Lewandowski was not involved in uncovering Nunberg's social media history, but the tension between the two camps on the campaign increased to the point that New York Magazine's Gabriel Sherman described the situation as a "civil war."

	In a phone call with Business Insider after the Stone split became public on Saturday, a Trump campaign source disputed the notion Stone quit over the public feud with Kelly. The source said the campaign confirmed that a consultant who was recently terminated attempted to plant negative stories in the wake of Nunberg's firing.

	Donald Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski were seen having a public screaming match on the street in Manhattan on Wednesday night.

	Onlookers were stunned to see Hicks, 27, hollering at Lewandowski, 42, in plain view of passersby on 61st Street near Park Avenue.

	One witness told us, “Hope was screaming at Corey, ‘I am done with you!’ It was ugly, she was doubled over with her fists clenched. He stood there looking shocked with his hands on his head.”

	Minutes after the news of Lewandowski’s firing broke, Michael Caputo, an adviser and Manafort ally gleefully tweeted:

	 Caputo has since resigned.

	Relations had been steadily growing more and more contentious; sources told ABC News that Lewandowski had been suspected of hatching a plot to leak malignant stories about Jared Kushner, husband to daughter Ivanka and a growing and powerful voice within the campaign. Lewandowski denied any such plan in interviews on Monday and told ABC News that he has a 


wtf was going on with Trump's campaign

I had figured most of them for Russia agents in the first place?

	But senior aides stressed to ABC News that the firing was not in response to any recent events but had been a growing murmur for months. Lewandowski’s famous slogan, “Let Trump be Trump” is how he operated. Many within and outside the campaign long accused him of enabling some of Trump’s more divisive and controversial positions, including Trump’s remark that an American judge presiding over one of his cases couldn’t be impartial due to his “Mexican heritage.” 


weird

	One source tells ABC News that Manafort, who has essentially had control over the campaign since becoming its chair, will become the campaign manager. 


Manafort who worked with Stone before

Manafort double agent or not? did he set up Pence?

	Stone also said Ivanka Trump, who is a key member of Trump's inner circle, is “one of the most amazing women” he had ever met, and would be an important asset to the campaign in her appeal to women, a demographic Trump has struggled to engage with.

	“Ivanka is a very effective surrogate, in terms of giving first-person testimony to her experience, and she has knowledge of the many women that Trump has mentored and whose careers he has supported,” he said.

	Allen asked Stone if the Trump campaign was thinly staffed and needed to recruit more advisers, especially in the speechwriting department, drawing attention to the controversy regarding the similarities between Melania Trump’s speech and Michelle Obama's 2008 convention speech.

	“Yes, that would probably be useful,” he said.

	Stone, prone to conspiracy theories, has a history in controversial elections. He played a role in the recount in Florida between Al Gore and George W. Bush by leading protestors to a Florida recount office, causing a stoppage in the process, a move that was widely viewed to have helped Bush.

	"Troubling new evidence appears to show that the Trump campaign not only was aware of cyberattacks against Secretary Clinton’s campaign chairman, but was openly bragging about it as far back as August," wrote the congressmen, Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, John Conyers of Michigan, Eliot Engel of New York and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.

	Stone and Trump have had a long and fractious relationship. They first met in 1979, when Stone came to New York from D.C. to set up a campaign office for Ronald Reagan in what was then country club Republican territory. Trump found him some cheap office space. Stone later worked for Trump’s casinos as a lobbyist in New Jersey. They had a serious falling out after Stone threatened Spitzer’s father in phone messages and then took credit for bringing down the governor. After Trump called him “a Stone cold liar,” the two men didn't speak for two years.

	October 4th, 2016

	Trump ally Roger Stone suspects that the candidate’s campaign is out of joint, and someone in the tent might be responsible for leaking Trump’s 1995 tax returns.

	Speaking Tuesday on Boston Herald Radio, Stone, the former Trump campaign advisor, explained his theories about the provenance of the leaked returns, which ended up in mailboxes belonging to reporters at the New York Times and New York Daily News.


Stone leaked the tax returns

	Stone said the leak might have come from “Somebody who worked at The Trump Organization, perhaps. Or perhaps a former employee. But I would just be speculating.”

	He added later: “Well there’s a lot of fighting and I would say in-fighting and jockeying inside the current Trump campaign. It’s not nearly as smoothly operating as it was during the time that Paul Manafort, a true professional, was running things.”



Isn't Stone known for doing oppo research? would Trump have given him his tax returns?

 	Trump’s political adviser, Roger Stone, said it’s unlikely Trump would release his tax returns – as many presidential candidates do in the spirit of full disclosure – to verify Trump’s worth.

	Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said the business “never asked Jeb Bush personally to approve casino gambling.” Roger Stone, a Trump confidante and former campaign adviser, told Fox News this week that Trump had tried to get casino gambling under Bush’s Democratic predecessor, Lawton Chiles, but his efforts “ceased” with Bush’s 1998 election, given Bush’s “well known” opposition to expanding gambling.

IIRC was speculating before that Kelly was in with the CIA or something

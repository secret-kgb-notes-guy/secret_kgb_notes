	 In June of that year, Prokhorov was elected to the leadership of the party at the Right Cause Party Congress of 2011. At the acceptance ceremony, Prokhorov officially criticized the present ruling tandem of Medvedev-Putin, the structure of Russia, and vowed to bring Russia back to a stable development course.[36] However, in September 2011, Prokhorov reversed course and resigned from Right Cause, "condemning it as a 'puppet Kremlin party' micromanaged by a 'puppet master' in the president's office ... Vladislav Y. Surkov".[37]

	In December 2011, after the legislative elections, Prokhorov announced that he would contest the 2012 presidential election against Vladimir Putin as an independent.[38] He called it at the time "probably[39] the most important decision of my life".[38] According to BBC Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov and opposition leader Boris Nemtsov both saw the move as inspired by the Kremlin. According to Mr Nemtsov is an attempt "to preserve Putin's regime".[40]


this guy legit?


Zhirinovsky, "Russia's Donald Trump," also attacked him saying he rigged the media


dunno if that helps him or hurts him... if there were KGB agents pretending to be (bad) pro-Pokhorov shills, that could be a sign they saw him as a threat.


Even still same thing happened with Clinton, and she was a puppet of theirs


	...As for foreign policy, his view was that Russia should create a closer partnership for trade with the European Union and a closer partnership with the Central Asian zone. Undesirable countries in his opinion are the "non-democratic" or human-rights- abusing regimes, of which he named Iran and Syria as the primary ones.


is he supposed to be some kind of Western-stooge? although dunno if Syria would be very popular among Russian people.


new brilliant idea: CIA should back Navalny next election to ruin him

hehe maybe that would backfire a lot...

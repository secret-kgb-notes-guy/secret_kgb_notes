	Meghan McCain: Mike Pence’s Denial About Russia Communication Was ‘A Lie’

	...Meghan McCain excoriated both Pence and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort on the show, calling the latter “incompetent” and “one of the worst people who work in politics.” She indicated that Pence’s statement of denial in January “is now a lie.”

	“How they have let this spin so completely out of control is beyond my comprehension,” she said.

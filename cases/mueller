Senator WHITEHOUSE
. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  have  two  questions,  Mr.  Goldsmith.  One  relates  to  the  famous,  
or   infamous,   night   at   the   hospital   that   Senator   Schumer   has   
brought  to  the  world’s  attention  through  the  testimony  of  Deputy  
Attorney  General  Comey.  It  has  to  do  with  some  of  the  individuals  
who were involved that night and how they reacted. 
You’ve  described,  in  your  book,  Deputy  Attorney  General  Comey  
as a ‘‘seasoned prosecutor who thinks clearly in times of crisis, who 
possesses  a  keen  sense  of  proportion  that  is  the  mark  of  good  judg-
ment’’,  and  who  was,  you  said,  ‘‘the  most  level-headed  person  I  
knew in government.’’
Mr. G
OLDSMITH
. Yes, sir. That’s my belief. 
Senator W
HITEHOUSE
. Yes. And Bob Mueller was also engaged in 
the  activities  that  night.  I  view  him  as  of  similar  stature  and  na-
ture. Do you also? 
Mr.   G
OLDSMITH
.   Yes,   sir.   I   have   great   admiration   for   Mr.   
Mueller.

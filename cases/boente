	Dana J. Boente, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia described the allegations against Mallory as “serious,” saying in a statement that he threatened national security.

		The conduct alleged in this complaint is serious, and these charges should send a message to anyone who would consider violating the public’s trust and compromising our national security by disclosing classified information.

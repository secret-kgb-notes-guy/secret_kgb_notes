	CIA Director Mike Pompeo misrepresented the facts when he suggested the Trump administration was responsible for changing China’s policy on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.

	Pompeo said that “the Chinese now … believe the correct answer has to be a denuclearized peninsula.” In fact, China has supported “the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” since at least 2005.


Pompeo shilling for Trump?

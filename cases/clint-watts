	GARCIA-NAVARRO: How effective, though, is this, really? The people that engage on Twitter - normally journalists - or are interested in politics or other issues. It doesn't reach the vast majority of Americans.

	WATTS: I disagree. And here's why. One, Twitter is the means by which you can disseminate a message globally the fastest. If you put something out on Twitter, mainstream news, TV producers, global media outlets - they are watching Twitter because they're all trying to stay ahead of the news cycle. They then take news that comes from these sources. And then they build their stories out on mainstream outlets. So you'll often hear Americans say, well, I'm not on Twitter, so I'm not being influenced. Actually, that's not exactly how it works. Twitter is the best way to propagate a message across all social media. It is the best platform that you can use to get global dissemination.

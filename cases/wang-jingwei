or "Wang Ching-wei"

also known as Wang Shao-ming

	One of Chinese anarchism’s most significant early figures Wang Jingwei, crops up throughout the text as one of Chiang Kai-Shek's main rivals. Wang Jingwei was one if the first Chinese anarchists, working as part of a group in Paris in 1905 he published a journal which translated many classic anarchist writings into Chinese and which had a considerable influence on the development of the Chinese left. However Wang Jingwei’s anarchism is never mentioned in the book as by the time Chiang Kai-Shek’s story starts it is far in his past and he is part of the republican government. Reading the story of what Wang Jingwei had become puts the denunciations of him by the anarchists of the 1910’s into context.

	Wang Jingwei’s (1883-1944) famed February 1910 attempt on the life of Prince-regent Chun (1883-1951) was reportedly made possible by the explosives sent by the Russian revolutionary exiles in Nagasaki


https://books.google.com/books?id=tOSeAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA124
	Shortly after Miyazaki and the others helped start Min Pao, they themselves put out a magazine that was frankly international and socialist in nature. From the alacrity with which the Japanese police swooped down upon it, there can be no doubt that this publication represented a definite break between Miyazaki and his former sponsors.
	After the February Revolution of 1905 in Russia, several refugees and revolutionaries had made their way to Nagasaki. There they formed a revolutionary party with Dr. Nicolai Russel at its head. They tried to publish a paper, but they were so short of funds that they resorted to measures like robbery and the sale of maps of the Russian shoreline. In 1906 Sun Yat-sen to Annam with Kayano Chochi. On his way, he met Russel. The two discussed general problems, and agreed that their revolutions had complementary aims. The Doctor's scientific training made research in bomb assembly possible, and before long materials were being smuggled to him inside rubber dolls. We are told that the explosives Wang Ching-wei intended for the Prince Regent in 1909 were made from photographic supplies by the Russians in Nagasaki.
	Miyazaki, Kayano, and several others met these Russians in 1906. Together with several socialists, they published a magazine called Kakumei hyoron (Revolutionary review) which was to speed both revolutions.


http://www.republicanchina.org/tragedy.html
	Dr. Sun Yat-sen conferred the post of "da yuanshuai" (i.e., grand marshal) and governor for Guangdong Prov onto Hu Hanmin before departing for Peking for sake of peace talks with Northern Warlord Lineage government. Sun Yat-sen's Grand Camp in Canton was controlled by 'KMT Central Politics Meeting', with three members of Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai and Wu Tiyun. When Sun Yat-sen fell ill, Borodin, Wang Jingwei and Ma Chaojun etc went inside of Russian embassy for discussions with Leo Karakhan. Borodin told Wang Jingwei that he should be the natural successor of Sun Yat-sen. On March 12th, Sun Yat-sen passed away in Peking due to liver cancer. Peking newspapers eulogized Sun Yat-sen as the 'founding father' of ROC, a reverence name later adopted by KMT standing committee on Mar 21 of 1940. (Sun Yat-sen, before his death, had mentioned that 'enemies are just beside you' when Wang Jingwei requested time and again for death bed instructions. I would not be able to tell whether Sun Yat-sen had realized his blunder in allying with USSR/CCP and meant the 'enemies' to be Russian and CCP agents.) 

what?

	The editor of the secret Min-pao was Wang Ching-wei, an ardent supporter of Sun and one definitely influenced by the Anarchist writings of this period. Chang Ping-lin, now excluded from authority, complained bitterly that this was a false Min-pao, but Hsin Shih-chi, helping to distribute it, asserted “party members in the East are paying no attention to Chang’s charges.” 77 And Wang was to be the final hero of the Paris journal. Its last issue, published on May 21, 1910, might well have been called the Wang Ching-wei special edition, since it was devoted almost entirely to praise of Wang for his attempted assassination of the Manchu Prince Regent


https://books.google.com/books?id=r3AJFusMHJwC&pg=PA370&lpg=PA370&dq=%22Wang+Ching-wei%22+OR+%22Wang+Shao-ming%22+OR+%22Wang+Jingwei%22+Russian+anarchist&source=bl&ots=2xw4qt6pZ_&sig=NnEgRCGSg_oJGqjamah_nzBW3YI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5h_3vmsjTAhVF6SYKHYe_Di8Q6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=%22Wang%20Ching-wei%22%20OR%20%22Wang%20Shao-ming%22%20OR%20%22Wang%20Jingwei%22%20Russian%20anarchist&f=false
	The Chinese revolutionaries in Japan then were greatly influenced by the ideas of Russian anarchists, many of whom had fled to Japan after the failure of the Russian revolution in 1905. Wang Ching-wei's editorial tone in this period was distinctly militant. In the 1 February 1910 issue of Min Pao, he wrote a fiery discourse, "On the Revolutionary Current," advocating assassination to spark the overthrow of the dynasty.

	...Despite his position as the golden boy of Chinese nationalism, Wang Ching-wei remained aloof from Chinese politics after the establishment of the republic. He was influenced by anarchist ideas then current in emancipated intellectual circles in China.

"The Bolsheviks and the Chinese Revolution"

In February, the Politburo adopted urgent measures to assist the return to China of Wang Jingwie, the leader of the Guimingdang "leftists," who was then living in France. Whith Wang Jingwei's return (via Moscow of course, where Comintern officials were ready to discuss Chinese affairs with him), the Soviet leadership quite logically placed its hopes on the strengthening of the Goumindang's leftist faction.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Rachkovsky
	From 1885 until 1902, Rachkovsky was responsible for keeping anarchists under surveillance and on the run—and also, in many cases, financed and supplied with ideas... “[P]rominent among his early initiatives were provocations designed to lure credulous émigrés into the most heinous crimes of which they may never have otherwise conceived.” Rachkovsky’s aim was to entrap his targets into committing acts that would help ensure that his job seemed of vital importance to the czar. This guaranteed him a solid berth in Paris that was lucrative both in salary and prestige [and] in opportunities for corrupt under-the-radar dealings with a French government doing heavy business with Russia."

He Zhen’s comments were radical and short: she argued that Russian Anarchism was best for China, and that it consisted of a 3-stage process: (1) speech and discussion; (2) political activity; and (3) a period of assassination.

Borodin organizing disasters in Chinese revolution

Close with Chian Kai-shek but even closer with Wang



http://www.academia.edu/27823615/Anarchism_and_Assassination_Dom_Carlos_to_the_Qings_Zaifeng_Regent

 In China, Scalapino and Yu (1961, 10) state that the Chinese anarchists of the early 20
th
 century were ‘at one with Marxists in wanting massive peasant-worker support, and it was the anarchist movement that ﬁrst introduced this concept in its modern form into the stream of Chinese political thought’.
50
 Te head of the Comintern’s 1923-1927 mission to Sun Yat Sen’s KM, Mikhail Gruzenberg, known as ‘Mike Berg’ in his Chicago base in the ﬁrst two decades of the 20
th
 century, selected the nom de guerre ‘Borodin’ for his revolutionary missions. Tis pseudonym was precisely the name that the anarchist prince, Peter Kropotkin, had used for a pseudonym as described in his 1899 text,
 Memoirs of a Revolutionist 
.
51
 Gruzenberg operated in Chicago where Bill Haywood had founded the syndicalist International  Workers of the World (IWW) in June 1905. Te IWW  was similar in methods and strategy to the anarchist-syndicalist unions that were at the same time emerging in France (CG) and Spain (CN). Both Haywood and Gruzenberg would be in Moscow from 1921, with Haywood an advisor to Lenin’s Bolshevik government, 1921-1923. Gruzenberg subsequently headed the Comintern’s political mission in China by the fall of 1923, while Haywood would die at the age of 59 in Moscow in May 1928 following Stalin’s rise to power and Gruzenberg’s recall from China.
52
 Joining them in Moscow intermittently from the same Chicago base was Katayama Sen, the North American Socialist and Japanese Marxist who was a founding member of the American Communist Party. Te only East Asian on the Executive Council of the Comintern while it 
was supporting Sun Yat Sen, he died in Moscow on 5 November 1933 not two weeks before the new U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt provided U.S. diplomatic recognition to the Soviet regime. Even a hypothetical sketch of possible operational links of the CCP back to European anarchists, and particularly to France,
53
 has seldom been suggested, despite Paris being the focus of Chinese anarchist activities in Europe and leading members of the CCP having studied there, some through anarchist eﬀorts. Tose resident in France during signiﬁcant anarchist activity includes the two CCP leaders who  were most responsible for China’s opening to the  West beginning in 1968, Zhou Enlai
周恩來
 and Deng Xiaoping
鄧小平
. While Scalapino (1961) began to assert the CCP connections to Anarchism, he referenced Mao Zedong
毛澤東
,just twice and did not tie Mao’s remark to Edgar Snow that ‘that he had once been strongly inﬂuenced by anarchism’
54
into the methodology by which anarchists may have linked their Asian operations to the leading Chinese  Anarchist centre in Paris.


Scalapino only writes once of Zhou Enlai as ‘having come from Germany’ in 1922 as the Communist Party was being formed,
55
 while he provides no data on Deng Xiaoping. France, one notes, preceded most Western nations by recognising the People’s Republic of China on 27 January 1964,  while having been a key centre for the development of Vietnam’s Ho Chi-minh and the strange political enigma of Pol Pot.

The French Connection



Te views of Western European police department that links are likely to have been operational have been belittled by authors such as the British Fabian and Libertarian Socialist G.D.H. Cole who reported while he was Professor of Social and Political Teory at Oxford that no concrete evidence was ever produced to tie the acts of lone assassinations to anarchist spokesmen, including individuals such as Kropotkin, or to larger organisational structures. Cole likely was recalling the trials of 30 French anarchists who were rounded up after the assassination of French President Carnot on 24 June 1894. Te internationally renowned anarchists Sébastien Faure and Jean Grave, the latter being a major inﬂuence on Parisian-based Chinese anarchists, were two of the 27 tried and acquitted, but baﬄingly Cole does not provide any speciﬁc evidence for what he asserts. ypical was his broad brush assertion concerning Anarchist violence in the late 19
th
 century


maybe I'm not the first to notice this...


http://spartacus-educational.com/Mikhail_Borodin.htm
	Borodin moved to London in 1906. However, the following year he settled in the United States. For a time he worked with Jane Addams at the Hull House Settlement. He was a member of the Socialist Party of America and in September 1919, he joined forces with Jay Lovestone, Earl Browder, John Reed, James Cannon, Bertram Wolfe, William Bross Lloyd, Benjamin Gitlow, Charles Ruthenberg, William Dunne, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Louis Fraina, Ella Reeve Bloor, Rose Pastor Stokes, Claude McKay, Max Shachtman, Martin Abern, Michael Gold and Robert Minor, to form the American Communist Party. Within a few weeks it had 60,000 members. 

wtf

 	Lenin had argued: "'The outcome of the struggle will be determined by the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., constitute the overwhelming majority of the population of the globe.'' Leon Trotsky added: ''The road to Paris and London lies via the towns of Afghanistan, the Punjab and Bengal''.

In search of Modern China:
The Chinese remembered Karakhan's generous words: the Soviet goal was
to "free the people from the yoke of the military force of foreign money
which is crushing the people of the East, and principally the people of
China."12

	Mikhail Borodin (born Mikhail Gruzenberg) – a prominent Comintern (Communist International) agent, and later a Chinese government adviser of Communist leader Mao. He joined the Bolshevik party in 1903 and became an associate of Vladimir Lenin. He worked in Mexico, the United States and the United Kingdom as a Comintern agent.

	It was their intention, as Stalin told a gathering of Moscow party workers in the spring of 1927, to use the Guomindang so that, 'squeezed out like a lemon', it could then be 'thrown away' when the time was right.19 One of the uses of the Guomindang, Moscow calculated, was to fill the dangerous spaces of neighbouring China with a power that was less hostile to the Soviet Union than other contenders for control - Japan and Britain in particular. 


http://annebobroffhajal.com/2010/05/mysteries-of-my-grandfather-introduction/
	I started searching documents on line, and after careful research discovered that my relatives were involved in the Bolsheviks’ scheme of gold laundering (melting down the bars in Stockholm, and replacing the Czar’s seal with that of the Swedish Crown) and trading for American goods — most of it used to fund the Bolshevik’s reign of terror, not for feeding the starving population, as their propaganda boasted. Others involved? J. P. Morgan’s bank, Armand Hammer, and a host of other international financiers.

	Your grandfather probably came into contact with a man (re-)named “Borodin” (in reality, Mikhail Gruzenberg, AKA Mike Berg — founded Berg’s Progressive Preparatory School for immigrant children in Chicago, as a cover), or his co-workers. Borodin was an infamous Comintern agent who lived very near my relatives. He hung out at Jane Addams’ Hull House, and was considered a socially conscious good guy, interested not in making a livingk, but in providing immigrant Russian-Jewish children a bright future in America. He was good at his cover …

Borodin agent helped smuggle Sun Yat Sen's widdow to Moscow

	When the last group of returning refugees left Chicago in June, 1917, the activities of the Anarchist Red Cross which we had worked on for so long, seemed to have reached an end; neither those who left for Russia nor those who remained in the United States dreamed that in a few years they would have to organize another Anarchist Red Cross to help the new political prisoners in Russia. We could not foresee that the brutalities of the Tsar’s government would seem like child’s play in comparison with those that the new despots of Russia would initiate. The whole thinking world imagined that Russia was on the way to becoming one of the most democratic countries in the world.

http://spartacus-educational.com/Mikhail_Borodin.htm
	the Soviet government announced that it was providing help to the Kuomintang. By March the government had decided to give 2 million dollars of financial aid to the organization. Chiang Kai-shek, one of Sun's leading generals arrived in Moscow to study the military tactics used in the Russian Civil War.

	Mikhail Borodin arrived in Peking in September 1923 to work as chief political adviser to Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee.


https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4MI_fPGURIC&pg=PA115
	After 20 March 1926 some Soviet advisers were suspicious about Chiang's intentions but the relationship was maintained. Among the advisors Borodin supported Chiang the most. Chiang Kaishek and Borodin had had fairly cordial relations before the Zongshan Gunboat Incident, if not as close as those between Borodin and Wang Jingwei. 

	...When Borodin returned to Guangzhou at the end of April, he realized Chiang Kaishek had become the most powerful man in the GMD and had an unshakable determination to launch the Northern Expedition. ...But Borodin did not openly oppose it for fear that Chiang would think that all Soviet advisers sided with Wang Jingwei, who was against the Northern Expedition. Borodin only privately told Chiang's personal aides several times that the Northern Expedition was doomed to fail politically, even though it might succeed militarily.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_United_Front
	In 1927 Nationalist Field Marshal (Generalissimo) Chiang Kai-shek purged the Communists from the Front while the Northern Expedition was still half-complete. This initiated a civil war between the two parties that lasted until the Second United Front was formed in 1936

	In May 1926, Borodin and Chiang Kaishek had a series of discussions about the relations between the CCP and the GMD. Chiang demanded that the communists should not occupy key positions in the GMD and asked that a list of the communists within the GMD be submitted to the chairman of the Central Executive Committee. Borodin considered the restrictions on communists to be too harsh.

	...Borodin reminded his colleagues that it was not yet time to engage in a struggle against Chiang; the urgent and current task was to prepare future opportunities so they should not rupture relations with Chiang for the time being.

	With the growth of KMT authority and military strength, the struggle for control of the Party's direction and leadership intensified. In January 1927 the NRA commanded by Chiang Kai-shek captured Wuhan and went on to attack Nanchang, while KMT leader Wang Jingwei and his left-wing allies, along with the Chinese Communists and Soviet agent Borodin, transferred the seat of the Nationalist Government from Guangzhou to Wuhan. On March 1 the Nationalist government reorganized the Military Commission and placed Chiang under its jurisdiction, while secretly plotting to arrest him. Chiang found out about this plot, which most likely led to his determination to purge the CCP from KMT

	The attention was turned to root out remaining pockets of Communist activity in a series of five encirclement campaigns. The first and second campaigns failed and the third was aborted due to the Mukden Incident.

	But Borodin was neither Lafayette nor mastermind nor oracle. He took his orders from Moscow, and the orders became more and more confused. Stalin, embroiled in the struggle for power at home, made China policy a pawn in his game of wiping out opponents. When Sun passed on in 1925, leaving the field open for a power struggle within the Kuomintang itself, Borodin's coalition came apart. It was only a matter of time before Chiang Kai-shek, graduate of the military academy that Borodin and Blyukher had set up, seized control, turned on the Chinese Communists, and sent the Russian advisers packing.

Borodin set up Whampao academy

	The twin rival KMT governments, known as the Ninghan (Nanjing and Wuhan) Split (Chinese: 宁汉分裂), did not last long because the Wuhan Kuomintang also began to violently purge Communists as well after Wang found out about Stalin's secret order to Borodin to organize CCP's efforts to overthrow the left-wing KMT and take over the Wuhan government. More than 10,000 communists in Canton, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Changsha were arrested and executed within 20 days. The Soviet Union officially terminated its cooperation with the KMT while Wang, fearing retribution as a Communist sympathizer, fled to Europe. The Wuhan Nationalist government soon disintegrated, leaving Chiang as the sole legitimate leader of the Kuomintang. In the year after April 1927, over 300,000 people were killed across China in anti-Communist suppression campaigns carried out by the KMT


Looks like Borodin started the Chinese civil war and tried to sabotage the northern expedition?

Borodin split CCP and KMT, then Wang split the KMT left and right by moving the capital and other things

Looks like Wang helped with the CCP KMT split as well by doing his own purges

How much of the purges were Chiang, and how much were Wang? How did they become so violent?


So what was the thinking? if they really wanted the northern expedition to fail, starting the civil war makes sense. Basically stop Chiang from consolidating power.

A question of would they have wanted the bloody purges? it could have helped make Chiang less popular and help join more peasents in the CCP's ranks.

It looks like some purges they didn't want tough? like maybe the one interrupred by the Mukden incident:

A familiar pattern... make your useful idiots communists and their controlled opposition nazis


Maybe was supposed to happen again today? Trump is Nazi-like, and Bo Xilai was supposed to be a fan of Mao

Ok this is saying they wanted the whole peasant revolution thing, then Wang started purging


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reorganized_National_Government_of_the_Republic_of_China
	While Chiang Kai-shek focused his primary attentions against the Communist Party of China, Wang Jingwei diligently toiled to preserve the peace between China and Japan, repeatedly stressing the need for a period of extended peace in order for China to elevate itself economically and militarily to the levels of its neighbor and the other Great powers of the world

Sounds like the same thing Yang Du was saying

puppet, but who's?


Did Wang's Betrayal help prolong the war? take some forces with him? demoralize Chinese?

puppet army

Anyway sounds like they wanted Chiang to ally with the Japanese against the communists. So the same fascist vs. communist thing. When that didn't work out I guess that had Wang try to do it instead. So Wang could be the fascist anti-communist foil

So basically it looks like a failed influence op on Chaing, and Wang stepping in to do what they wanted Chiang to do.

It would have been important for them to get the country "united" under communism, so having imperial/traitor/fascist opposition in Chiang would have done that. 

It looks like Chiang was trying to play both sides and unite the Communists and nationalists, and they would have saw that as a threat. So we see the split, the purge, Wang apparently making the purge worse, then trying to get him to ally with fascist with the german aide, appeasement with Japan, etc.

I guess basically they wanted the whole war to be their communists vs fascists. And ideological war where fascists are of course proved evil (unit 731, the Holocaust) and the communists are proved "good."

FDR was maybe "close enough" to be communist.

	By November 1940, the Reorganized Nationalist Party had secured enough local support to begin hostile takeovers of both Chinese courts and banks still under nominal control by the KMT in Chongqing or Western powers. Buoyed by this rapid influx of seized collateral, 


OK so what did Wang's government siphon of funding for the KMT?

	Hoping to expand the treaty in such a way as to be useful, Wang formally traveled to Tokyo in June 1941 in order to meet with prime minister Fumimaro Konoe and his cabinet to discuss new terms and agreements. Unfortunately for Wang, his visit coincided with the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, a move which further emboldened officials in Tokyo to pursue total victory in China, rather than accept a peace deal. 

It just the same as Ukraine wasn't it? Have your opponent by occupied by fascists, then come in yourself to "liberate" them

All the while they could play off both sides to ensure they were weak (and in Chiang's case dependent on the Soviet union for awhile?) and always destroying each other, never completely winning

"frozen conflict"

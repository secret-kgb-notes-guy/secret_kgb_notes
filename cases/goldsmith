The suspect list was quickly reduced to one: the Russian government. The evidence for that was murky to begin with but has grown more solid over time. (“Anything’s possible” replied Barack Obama, when asked about possible Russian involvement.) Harvard law professor and cybersecurity expert Jack Goldsmith has cautioned that “there is no public evidence whatsoever tying Russia to the hack,” and that “attribution for cyberoperations of this sort is very tricky and tends to take some time.”

Jack Goldsmith
Found 10 Records, 8 Photos and 455,602 Family Trees

Born in Memphis, Tennessee, USA on 1909 to Fred Goldsmith and Aimee Landman. Jack married Geneva Carter and had a child. Jack married Jen Coleman and had a child.

No idea if this means anything, but kindof weird? a Jack Goldsmit born in Memphis with mother Aimee Landman. But the maybe-KGB Goldsmith's middle name is Landman.

Maybe it's a way to help fake a birth certificate?

So far, it's looking like the Trump-Russia scandal will be swept under the rug.

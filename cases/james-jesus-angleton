	“Do you know what you've done?” he said. “You've blown my cover. My wife, in 31 years of marriage, was never aware of my activity until your story. And now she's left me.”


Angleton calls Hersh to give him more material, says "my wife left me" for his report, calling attention to it and making it look like the report was more scandalous than it actually was.


Angleton in on it?

The same as any of them--keeps doing stupid, inexplicable things that just happen to help Russia...


what would be the purpose of all this?

	This search seems even more appropriate today. Angleton once again has become relevant to the issue — grown almost into a national debate —of what the C.I.A.'s mission should and should not be. He is, in effect, waging covert war on the C.I.A.'s new counterintelligence leaders over the one aspect of the problem that for him is the issue — the C.I.A.'s ability to withstand Soviet penetration. Though an outsider now, he is still on the scene, in his behind-thescenes fashion. He has become a source for many current newspaper articles and books with considerable impact on public opinion.


Angleton to argue to the public that the cover ops are necessary due to Soviet ops, do a shit job of it, maybe kindof same deal as McMarthy (be an assole, crazy, annoying and tell the truth, then people believe a lie)


If he was liked in the CIA, and reponsible for CIA cliques fighting and CIA-FBI fight, Hersh attacking him could get people to rush to defend him (worked on me), stoking any conflicts surrounding Angleton

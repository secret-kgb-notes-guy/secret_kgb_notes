	Mainstream media is kind of an annoying construct, as is alternative and/or new media. My book focuses both on what we would traditionally refer to as the elite media: the NYTimes, WashPost, etc, as well as newer sources of investigative material, such as Wikileaks, Vice, and the Intercept. Some reporters at elite newspapers, like James Risen of the NYT, have done a great job challenging the CIA, White House, and their own editors, but often are shut down on important stories.

So why would a KGB agent want to say this?

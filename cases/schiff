	 But Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a Clinton supporter who is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, offered a different view after reading the emails.

	"The determination that something is top secret, for many people connotes that these are the most closely held secrets, that their revelation would be extremely damaging," he said. "There are potentially programs that are talked about all the time in the press that fit within that category." 

 	Schiff may have been referring to CIA drone strikes, which officials have said are discussed in the now-classified emails. The strikes are highly classified but are also widely discussed over unclassified channels in Washington and elsewhere.

	Special counsel brings on FBI official who oversaw Clinton email investigation

	Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller has brought on Peter Strzok, a senior FBI official who oversaw the Hillary Clinton email investigation, to help manage his investigation into Russian election meddling, according to two US officials briefed on the matter.

	Strzok helped oversee the beginnings of the Russia probe last summer at the FBI.


Is this good or bad? e-mail investigation was a disaster


Comey's fault, McCabe, but what about Strzok?

	On July 10, 2015, the F.B.I. opened a criminal investigation, code-named “Midyear,” into Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information. The Midyear team included two dozen investigators led by a senior analyst and by an experienced F.B.I. supervisor, Peter Strzok, a former Army officer who had worked on some of the most secretive investigations in recent years involving Russian and Chinese espionage.


so he does secret counter-intel investigations

unfortunately doesn't free him of suspicion of being a Russian spy (makes him more likely to be one actually)

Who got Page involved with the Trump team?

Palmer says "oh it must have been Sessions" maybe?

WaPo does say Page and Sessions had met, or at least could have...

	The campaign adviser said Page participated in three dinners held for the campaign’s volunteer foreign policy advisers in the spring and summer of 2016, coming from New York to Washington to meet with the group. Although Trump did not attend, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a top Trump confidant who became his attorney general, attended one meeting of the group with Page in late summer, the campaign adviser said.

	Page appears to have had deeper ties with Russia, before and during and after the campaign, than anyone else in Trump’s employ. And whether by coincidence or reward, Trump then named Dearborn his White House Deputy Chief of Staff, and he named Sessions his Attorney General, raising questions about how they got those jobs.

Palmer also points out Dearborn is Trump's deputy chief of staff.

	Sessions Chief Rick Dearborn hired Carter Page to Trump campaign-is now Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff

Suspected Russian spy Scott Dworkin also insists it was Dearborn who brought on Page


Why are the Russians so interested in shifting focus to Page? The Russians said Page was an idiot. Was he supposed to be some kind of fall-guy?

Page suspected Russian agent, target of FISA


	The judges who rule on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests oversee the nation’s most sensitive national security cases, and their warrants are some of the most closely guarded secrets in the world of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence gathering. Any FISA application has to be approved at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the FBI.

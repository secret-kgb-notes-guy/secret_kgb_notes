	Wyden: ‘No Longer’ Any Question About If Trump Campaign Tried To Collude

	Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) on Tuesday said there is “no longer a question” as to whether President Donald Trump’s campaign tried to collude with Russia to influence the 2016 election in his favor.

	“The highest levels of the Trump campaign walked, eyes open, into a meeting designed to advance the Russian government’s support for Donald Trump,” Wyden said in a statement, citing emails Donald Trump Jr. released on Tuesday morning.

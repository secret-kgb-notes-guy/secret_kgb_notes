	It Only Seems That Political Corruption Is Rampant

	With the indictment last week of the former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell on fraud and conspiracy charges, one might surmise that high-level political scandal is breaking out all over. And in a way, one would be right: It has been a good year, or perhaps a bad one, for hauling politicians before judges.

	Three members of the House of Representatives pleaded guilty to, or were convicted of, crimes in 2013, more than any other year since 1981, when the now-cinematized Abscam sting operation put six House members and a senator behind bars. Last year, former mayors of Detroit and New Orleans, among others, were convicted of, or charged with, felonies.

	RAY SUAREZ: Who would be interested in committing a terrorist attack against a Russian-owned jet heading for a Russian city?

	MICHAEL WINES: Well, it’s an interesting question. I can think of two groups offhand. Russia has recently quite solidly joined the western side of this international coalition against terrorism, and it’s not a leap of speculation to think that someone might want to down a Russian plane to make a point to the Russians that they will pay a price, too, for siding with the United States. On the other hand, this is a plane that was filled almost exclusively with Jewish passengers, recent émigrés from Russia who had moved to Israel who were returning to Novosibirsk to celebrate a Jewish holiday. So it’s also equally easy to speculate, if it was in fact a terrorist act, that perhaps these were people who were downed as some sort of retaliation in the dispute between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

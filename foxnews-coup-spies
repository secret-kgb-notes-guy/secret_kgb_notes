Heads up, it looks like Russia is trying to influence U.S. media, and there might be some Russian spies in Fox News:

There are indications Russia has been planning a U.S. coup for a long time:

    "We rarely use guns to kill people and take their country. The cleanest way is to blackmail, pervert, bribe, lie and intimidate the POLITICIANS and the MEDIA, and they will destabilize and disunify their own country for us. Then all we have left to do is to arm the procommunist or simply criminal factions and we have a coup and another "liberated" country. As neat as that."

    "In 1984, Golitsyn published the book New Lies For Old,[15] wherein he warned about a long-term deception strategy of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the United States."

And placing spies in U.S. media is not a new tactic for the Russians:

The similarities in messaging between Fox News and known Russian propaganda outlets (see: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/unmasking-the-men-behind-zero-hedge-wall-street-s-renegade-blog, http://www.propornot.com/2016/10/zero-hedge.html, and http://www.stopfake.org/en/three-thousand-fake-tanks/) indicates that Russian attempts to influence Fox News might be working:

http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/01/07/was-fridays-declassified-report-claiming-russian-hacking-2016-election-rigged.html
	"Was Friday's declassified report claiming Russian hacking of the 2016 election rigged?
	...I am concerned both intelligence assessments were rigged for political purposes."

http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-real-purpose-of-the-u-s-national-intelligence-report-on-alleged-hacking-by-russia/5567726
	"The primary purpose of the declassified report, which offers no evidence to support its assertions that Russia hacked the U.S. presidential election campaign, is to discredit Donald Trump. I am not saying there was no Russian hack of John Podesta’s emails. I am saying we have yet to see any tangible proof to back up the accusation."

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-07/they-lost-so-big-trump-blasts-embarrassed-democrats-russian-hacking-report?page=5
	"The reason behind Trump's ongoing war with the intelligence agencies and the DNC is clear: with the report, and the ongoing media narrative, US intelligence services continue to delegitimize Trump's victory, by asserting that he was the favored candidate of Russia, and that Moscow ran a sophisticated operation to try to influence the election, taking away from Trump's victory."


http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/10/23/why-should-let-putin-put-his-hand-in-hornets-nest.html
	"But whatever his motives, Putin has the most realistic understanding of the way forward in Syria: Syrian president Bashir al-Assad has to be part of the solution. This is a brute fact that other actors -- the U.S., Turkey, the Saudis -- have been slow to recognize.

	...Moreover, Putin is demonstrating a surer geopolitical sensibility in recognizing that an end to the Syrian civil war that does not bring an even worse regime to power led by ISIS has to include Assad."

http://www.globalresearch.ca/putin-is-defeating-more-than-isis-in-syria-the-hypocritical-obama-administration-mask-has-been-blown-off/5482418
	"Russia in the last weeks has completely out-maneuvered the diabolical, and they are diabolical, agenda of the Obama Administration not only in Syria but also in the entire Middle East and now in the EU with unleashing the flood of refugees. He openly reached out to invite Obama in their New York September 30 meeting to cooperate together in defeating ISIS. Obama stubbornly insisted that first Assad must go, despite the fact that Christine Wormuth, the Pentagon Undersecretary responsible for the Syrian war, confirmed Russian statements about Assad’s essential role today in any defeat of ISIS."

	"But in the U.S., reports that Russia is trying to influence the 2016 presidential elections is unfolding in many political newsrooms like it’s a new occurrence.

	Even Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, is acting shocked that Russia is purportedly trying to hack into official computer systems.

	While the allegations are still unproven, the U.S. government nevertheless is saying they believe it to be true.  But Russian or Russian-approved tactics like cyber warfare and campaigns of misinformation have been happening for decades."

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-20/5-problems-cia-claims-russian-hacking
	"The CIA, he explains, did not formally release a report about Russia’s hacking — rather anonymous sources inside the agency allegedly leaked the “conclusion” to the Washington Post and New York Times. This is highly problematic for obvious reasons, not the least of which is the near impossibility of verification — both of the sources and the information."


http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/30/hannity_fbi_knows_they_are_about_to_be_exposed_by_wikileaks.html
	"Sean Hannity said on his radio show Friday that he doesn't believe reports from 'The New York Times' that the FBI's latest investigation into the Clinton Foundation is related to Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner. Instead, Hannity suspects that the FBI is protecting itself because they know that WikiLeaks is about to drop proof that Hillary Clinton should have been indicted in July."

	"Is This Why Comey Broke: A Stack Of Resignation Letters From Furious FBI Agents

	...And while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans, in the short-term, we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence.  As such, we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post."

	"It is so weird that Russia is the focus and yet, all of a sudden, Russia seems to be villain number one. Why is that? It seems strange."


Since they would be organized and supported by Russian signals and human intelligence, countering the influence of Russian spies could be a challenge for Fox News employees. Some spies might be more careful to not draw attention to themselves, and trying to root them out would be an asymmetric battle where they know everything about you and you know little about them.

But when the fog of uncertainty precludes informed decisions, principled decisions are a natural remedy:

In this arena, journalists have a weapon that the Russians cannot wield:

https://journalism.missouri.edu/tabbed-content/creed-2/
	"The Journalist’s Creed
	
	I believe in the profession of journalism.
	
	I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust.
	
	I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness are fundamental to good journalism.
	
	I believe that a journalist should write only what he holds in his heart to be true.
	
	I believe that suppression of the news, for any consideration other than the welfare of society, is indefensible.
	
	I believe that no one should write as a journalist what he would not say as a gentleman; that bribery by one’s own pocketbook is as much to be avoided as bribery by the pocketbook of another; that individual responsibility may not be escaped by pleading another’s instructions or another’s dividends.
	
	I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike serve the best interests of readers; that a single standard of helpful truth and cleanness should prevail for all; that the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.
	
	I believe that the journalism which succeeds best — and best deserves success — fears God and honors Man; is stoutly independent, unmoved by pride of opinion or greed of power, constructive, tolerant but never careless, self-controlled, patient, always respectful of its readers but always unafraid, is quickly indignant at injustice; is unswayed by the appeal of privilege or the clamor of the mob; seeks to give every man a chance and, as far as law and honest wage and recognition of human brotherhood can make it so, an equal chance; is profoundly patriotic while sincerely promoting international good will and cementing world-comradeship; is a journalism of humanity, of and for today’s world."

I hope you use it well. The fate of our country depends on what you do next.

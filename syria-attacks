	Rubio: Trump admin’s actions encouraged horrific gas attack in Syria


https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/bashar-al-assad-syria-chemical-attack.html
	At the Pentagon and in national security circles, the lightning series of events has raised a sharp question: Did the Haley-Tillerson-Spicer remarks embolden Mr. Assad to believe that he could get away with the chemical weapons attack?

An idea first pitched by Rubio. Provides an explanation for why the attack happened.

	Pentagon officials said Mr. Assad’s decision to drop chemical weapons on Idlib most likely included anxiety over the Syrian government’s losses of military gains made in the past two years. But several officials said the remarks by Ms. Haley, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Spicer could have emboldened Mr. Assad into believing that there would be no retaliation.

I thought their was an investigation to see if Russia is involved?

Would Tillerson/Haley/Spicer comments be planned? Or used opportunistically?

Ep. 201: Defending Trump from the Alt-Right
April 7, 2017 

Stranger things may have happened, but not lately. Jay and Mona welcome Bloomberg’s Eli Lake to talk national security, Syria, Susan Rice, chemical weapons, Russia, and more. Jay and Mona then find themselves defending our president against some of his disappointed fan boys.

Says Samantha Power wrote to Trump and thanked him for doing "what Obama wouldn't do?" huh

Why does it sound like Eli is kindof echoing me...

Lake says he hopes this is a start of Bigger plans by Trump for Syria to destroy Assad's air-force.


Trying to fake a split?


Didn't they try this shit before with Trump's "reaching out" to Congress?

	A Bannon ally in the White House told New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman that Bannon argued against the strike not out of constitutional concerns, but rather because “Steve doesn’t think we belong there.”
	
	Bannon was unable to persuade Trump, who instead ordered a massive launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles against a Syrian airbase from which the chemical attack is believed to have originated.

Looks like: might it look like Bannon is "losing influence," Trump is "reformed" and now listening to Kushner, but (uh oh!) it turns out Kushner is just as much of a Russian hack

Hello,

I'm looking into Russian support of terrorism and possible sabotage of space programs past and present.

I've been trying to get this right since these are big topics, but I'm not done yet.

In the meantime, just in case there are time-sensitive matters and some of this information is useful now, here are some rough notes on these topics.

First, some of these are interesting and related to the notes, and less rough:

	He recruited Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Vaso Čubrilović, Trifko Grabež, Muhamed Mehmedbašić, and Cvjetko Popović to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.

	They held out, but Ilić, who was picked up on a routine check, eventually broke down under pressure and named his fellow conspirators.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hand_%28Serbia%29
	It was also in 1914 that Apis allegedly decided that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir-apparent of Austria, should be assassinated, as he was trying to pacify the Serbians, and if this happened then a revolution would never occur. Towards that end it is claimed that three young Bosnian Serbs were recruited to kill the Archduke. They were definitely trained in bomb throwing and marksmanship by current and former members of the Serbian military. Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović and Trifko Grabež were smuggled across the border back into Bosnia via a chain of underground-railroad style contacts. The decision to kill the Archduke was apparently initiated by Apis, and not sanctioned by the full Executive Committee (assuming Apis was involved at all, a question that remains in dispute[14]). Those involved probably realized that their plot would result in war between Austria and Serbia, and had every reason to expect that Russia would side with Serbia. They likely did not, however, anticipate that the assassination would start a chain of events leading to world war one. Others in the government and some of the Black Hand Executive Council were not as confident of Russian aid. Russia had let them down recently. When word of the plot allegedly percolated through Black Hand leadership and the Serbian government (the Prime Minister Pašić was definitely informed of two armed men being smuggled across the border; it is not clear if Pašić knew the planned assassination), Apis was supposedly told not to proceed. He may have made a half-hearted attempt to intercept the young assassins at the border, but they had already crossed. Other sources say the attempted 'recall' was only begun after the assassins had reached Sarajevo. This 'recall' appears to make Apis look like a loose cannon, and the young assassins as independent zealots. In fact, the 'recall' took place a full two weeks before the Archduke's visit. The assassins idled around in Sarajevo for a month. Nothing more was done to stop them.

	Apis claimed that the removal of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand, the heir-apparent to the throne, would reduce the danger of Austria declaring war on Serbia. He therefore engaged two men to kill Ferdinand at Sarajevo in August 1914. The confession reads: "I decided this definitely only after Artamonov gave me assurance that Russia would not leave us without protection if Austria attacked us. To Mr. Artamonov on this occasion I did not impart any information on my plans regarding the assassination. To make my demand for his opinion as to the attitude of Russia well founded, I pretended that our intelligence activities might be detected, so that this also might be made to serve as an excuse for Austria to attack us. Malobabic completed the mission I assigned to him. He organized and carried out the assassination. His principal aides were in my service. They had a small honorarium which I was sending them through Malobabic. Some of their signed receipts are in Russian hands, since I was receiving the money I needed for this work from Artamonov."

	In other words, the financial and political backing of the Russian General Staff was essential to the planned assassination that kicked off World War I, Whatever other agencies were involved, the Serbian nationalist Apis would not have taken on the job without knowledge of full Russian backup. 


https://books.google.com/books?id=EmJODQAAQBAJ&pg=PT263&lpg=PT263&dq=Apis+Artamonov&source=bl&ots=AscnQYpz9n&sig=L7N4pSNqF1mprHOcXLhkXtBUTNY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOsJfzo6zTAhVKw4MKHfjyDE4Q6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&q=Apis%20Artamonov&f=false
	The Russian Embassy was an important element in the context. Before and during the first Balkan war--in which the Black Hand played a conspicuous role, organizing guerilla bands behind the enemy lines--the Russians gave financial and political support to the organization, as did Crown Prince Alexander. For a long time, not only the Russian military attache but the Ambassador, Hartwig, were in intimate contact with Apis. There is no suggestion that he personally pocketed any Russian funds, but the Russians looked upon him as their particular friend, if not quite their agent, and quite naturally tried to build him up in influence. Their success-with the help of the Black Hand's guerilla achievements in Macedonia--was altogether too brilliant. The Balkan wars dangerously inflated the prestige, the egos, and the recklessness of the Serbian officer caste. This was particularly the case with those who belonged to the Black Hand--starting with Apis.

	...Artamonov, the military attache, continued, however, to see his Serbian colleague and friend nearly every day. It was natural enough: they were conducting a joint secret-service operation across the nearby Austrian border, with the help of a chain of Serbian customs inspectors and frontier guards who had been recruited as secret operatives of Apis. Artamonov's contribution to the operation had been to furnish some $1600--an impressive sum by contemporary Balkan standards--toward financing the clandestine network that Apis was setting up on Austro-Hungarian soil, particularly in Bosnia.
	
	...According to former collaborators of Apis, Aramonov was fully informed about the subversive as well as the intelligence aspects o the project; whether he reported both of them to St. Petersburg and to Hartwig is not definitely established.

	For some time, Apis had been working in close harmony 
with the Russian military attache 1 to Belgrade, Colonel 
Victor Artamonov. Artamonov had been providing Apis 
with money to finance his intelligence network in Austria 
at a time when the Serbian General Staff was short of funds. 
In return, Apis probably shared some of the information 
gathered by his agents with Artamonov. Apis now may have 
told the Russian attache* about the assassination scheme, 
and asked if Serbia could count on Russian aid in the 
event of war. 

When Artamonov, apparently after consulting with St. 
Petersburg, reportedly assured him that Russia would stand 
by Serbia if Austria attacked first, Apis definitely made up 
his mind to have Franz Ferdinand killed. 


http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand#Russian_military_attach.C3.A9.27s_office
	Serbian reservists being transported on tramp steamers on the Danube, apparently accidentally, crossed onto the Austro-Hungarian side of the river at Temes-Kubin and Austro-Hungarian soldiers fired into the air to warn them off. This incident was blown out of proportion and Austria-Hungary then declared war and mobilized its army on July 28, 1914. Under the Secret Treaty of 1892 Russia and France were obliged to mobilize their armies if any of the Triple Alliance mobilized. Soon all the Great Powers (except Italy) had chosen sides and gone to war.

	It could be argued that this assassination set in motion most of the major events of the twentieth century, with its reverberations lingering into the twenty-first. The Treaty of Versailles at the end of the First World War is generally linked to the rise of Adolf Hitler and World War II. It also led to the Russian Revolution, which helped lead to the Cold War. This, in turn, led to many of the major political developments of the twentieth century, such as the fall of the colonial empires and the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union to super-power status.

	However, if the assassination had not occurred, it is very possible that European war would still have erupted, triggered by another event at another time. The alliances noted above and the existence of vast and complex mobilization plans that were almost impossible to reverse once put in motion made war on a huge scale increasingly likely from the beginning of the twentieth century. At the end of the War, the Slav provinces in the South were ceded to Serbia, which became part of the Serb led unified Kingdom of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The bullet fired on that fateful day, June 28, 1914 ended up making the assassin's political aspirations become a reality.

https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-was-Russia-more-responsible-for-the-outbreak-of-WW1
	Of course the real test of Russian approval for the assassination was to follow. Austria, first politely, then insistently, requested a Serbian investigation of the crime, which clearly originated within Serbia. When that failed, Austria, along with Germany, turned to Russia, with the just request that Russia use its influence to prevail upon Serbia to investigate the crime. Russia’s foreign minister, Sazanov, flatly, and with provocative rudeness, refused to do so.

Russia never paid their reparations?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_reparations#German_reaction
	Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles was not correctly translated. Instead of stating "... Germany accepts responsibility of Germany and her allies causing all the loss and damage ...", the German Government's edition reads, "Germany admits it, that Germany and her allies, as authors of the war, are responsible for all losses and damages ...".[22] This resulted in a prevailing belief of humiliation among Germans; the article was seen as an injustice and there was a view that Germany had signed "away her honor".[23][24] Despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware "that Germany's position on this matter was not nearly so favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war".[25] Politicians seeking international sympathy would continue to use the article for its propaganda value, persuading many who had not read the treaties that the article implied full war guilt.[19] German revisionist historians who later tried to ignore the validity of the clause found a ready audience among revisionist writers in France, Britain, and the USA.[26] The objective of both the politicians and historians was to prove that Germany was not solely guilty for causing the war; if that guilt could be disproved the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.[27]

July 18th, we find Foch leaving Nancy for a fornight's leave and a holiday at this home, the old manor-house of Trefeuntenuniou in Brittany. His son remained with this regiment, but his two doughters and their children came to Brittany at the same time, with this sons-in-law, their husbands...

	Foch next took charge of the French armies of the north; he now coordinated moves with the British and Belgian armies during the so-called “race to the sea.” If he did not succeed in going on the offensive, he did help check the German drive for the last true prizes of 1914, the Channel ports. Several times he was forced to brace up the nervous British commander, Sir John French, with what his biographer, B. H. Liddell Hart calls “an injection of Fochian serum.” But when the Germans ruptured the line at the Second Ypres in 1915, Foch’s insistence on counterattacks produced only unnecessary Allied losses. Death on an even larger scale was the most visible result of Foch’s Artois offensives in the spring and early fall of the year; casualties approached 150,000. After the Artois the [eacute]lan of the French common soldier, which he so prized, would never be the same.

https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/reviews/30113/marks-carley-1939-alliance-never-was-and-coming-world-war-ii
	Reviewed by Sally Marks
	The Russian alliance contributed both to keeping a comparatively weakening France in the ranks of the great powers before 1914 and to French survival in the first years of the Great War. Afterwards a shattered France needed the Russian tie more than ever, but ideological factors rendered that politically impossible whereas the eastern alliances with smaller states proved an unsatisfactory substitute, potentially more liabilities than assets. Thus the Nazi challenge impelled Paris to a new Russian pact in 1935, but mutual distrust rendered it still-born. France's reluctant ally, Britain, had even more strained relations with the Soviet Union. Hostility to a historic rival was both traditional and recent, broken only by a decade of detente from 1907 to 1917; ideology and incidents aggravated the interwar relationship. In his study of the 1939 negotiations among these three powers, Michael Carley asks whether Britain and France really sought to put aside existing distrust and achieve alliance with the Soviet Union against the greatest danger, Nazi Germany. He concludes that their effort was minimal, and he cites British prime minister Neville Chamberlain and interwar anti-communism as two major causes of World War II (pp. 144, 256).

	In lively, often colloquial prose, Carley hews closely to his topic, writing essentially out of British and French archival diplomatic files on Russia and the Chamberlain papers, together with recently published Soviet files on Britain and France. He provides a wealth of detail, especially to demonstrate that Chamberlain strongly opposed a Soviet tie, and quantities of translations of Russian documents which every future historian dealing with the subject will need to contemplate. In throwing new light on an old but sometimes neglected aspect of the coming of World War II and in providing much new material for historians to mull, Carley has made an important contribution.

This cabinet shuffle might not have gotten much public notice except that Dion is a distinguished parliamentarian, former leader of the party and leader of the opposition, and a former key minister in the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien. Freeland, on the other hand, is a well-known Ukrainian ultra-nationalist and self-declared Russophobe and hater of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

This should not be surprising because most Americans do not believe that the US government could be on the wrong side of any conflict. The Mainstream Media (MSM), both print and broadcast, serve as purveyors of this general idea. Call it «fake news» or propaganda, it works well on US public opinion.

	"The Bolshevik as Foe"

	In Paris, too, cooporation with the Bolsheviks was mooted. Even the soon-to-be-Allied generalissimo Fedinand Foch seemed disposed to listen. It made sense because the anti-Bolshevik factions were weak and pro-German. The "better" Russians hoped that the Germans would put down the revolution. On the other hand, In Feburary and March 1918 the Bolsheviks were preparing to fight the Germans. Foch and Lloyd George were among the first "realists" or pragmatists, ready to overlook Boshevik revolutionary ideas in order to ally with them against the greater German danger.

	Would pragmatism prevail?


https://he.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-illusion-of-peace-sally-marks/?sf1=barcode&st1=9780333985892
	Strongly interpretative and archivally based, The Illusion of Peace examines the emotional, ethnic, and economic factors responsible for international instability, as well as the distortion of the balance of power, the abnormal position of the Soviet Union, the weakness of France and the uncertainty of her relationship with Britain, and the inadequacy of the League of Nations. In so doing, the study clarifies the complex topics of reparations and war debts and challenges traditional assumptions, concluding that widespread western devotion to disarmament and dedication to peace were two of several reasons why democratic statesmen could not respond decisively to Hitler's threat. In this new edition Marks also argues that the Allied failure to bring defeat home to the German people in 1918-19 generated a resentment which contributed to interwar instability and Hitler's rise.


http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=7870
	MacMillan punctures a number of long-standing myths about the Versailles treaty with Germany. She declares firmly that a real defeat was not brought home to the German people, that the power of the peacemakers was limited, that they were not responsible for the fragmentation of Europe which predated their labors, and that the blockade did not starve Germany. More importantly, neither the Versailles treaty nor France was vindictive, reparations were not crushing, the treaty was not enforced with any consistency, and it did not seriously restrict German power, for Germany (where East Prussia had been separated from other portions for most of its history) had an improved strategic position under it. Most especially, while acknowledging that the peacemakers made mistakes, particularly outside Europe, she rightly asserts that the Versailles treaty was not primarily responsible for either the next twenty years or for World War II. These views have been discussed for a generation in the scholarly literature. Yet the old propaganda-driven myths persist in popular literature, the press, and the minds of educated non-experts. In her determined effort to slay these dragons, MacMillan has done a great service.	

	...Yet the bibliography and footnotes attest to MacMillan's wide reading and careful combing of recent scholarship, especially The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment after 75 Years. The bibliography precedes the footnotes which for some reason is extremely unhandy, particularly since footnotes are as brief as possible with no initial full citation. The footnoting system is idiosyncratic: with rare exceptions, paragraphs either have a single footnote at the end or none at all, even if containing quotations. The one citation lists sources for the paragraph in the order used, which in at least one instance meant citing the same book twice in a single note (p. 99, n. 3). This is not entirely satisfactory. An attempt to find the origin of an erroneous statement on Russia's 1918 reparations obligation to Germany in the middle of a paragraph on German financial questions (p. 185, n. 14) produced three perfectly good citations on Germany but nothing on Russia.

I ~~can't believe~~ these MYTHS about the treaty of versailles!

http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670825
	As Steiner observed, the German view of the treaty has prevailed, especially among nonexperts in the English-speaking world, thanks to prolonged, intense Anglo-German propaganda, including Keyne's brilliant but warped polemic. Among other things, World War I ushered in the age of propaganda, owing to the popular interest in the war and the postwar, and the views of the treaty have been heavily propaganda-driven.

No shit!

	Thanks to one of the world's most successful and longest-lasting propaganda efforts, the answer was simply that the treaty was unfair.

	...

	But this time the defeated power was not humiliated; instead, it was able to delude itself about the war's outcome.

pg 25

	Keynes was an added factor, intensifying British revisionism and hostility to treaty enforcement. The Economic Consequences of Peace, published in December 1919, was one of history's most brilliant and influential polemics, partly because few educated people then knew economics and, aware of their ignorance, accepted Keynes's distortions and omissions. While Keynes, who rarely admitted error, came to regret his book, long discredited by scholars, it lives on in new editions, academic analyses, and assumptions of less profound literature, a propaganda triumph second only to the Anglo-Germain campaign against the treaty.

	...On his relationship with Carl Melchior, see Keynes, Two Memoirs

pg 26

	Germany's constant revisionism operated in tandem with that of Britain, especially as frequent Anglo-French division rendered success possible. A German scholar noted that Germany suffered the "widespread illusion" that it could escape the consequences of the treaty by "passive noncompliance" As the United States withdrew from Europe and Britain tried to do so, Berlin recalled that it had not been defeated by continental powers and saw possibilities, spurring it to more revisionism. Some moves were costly, but Germany had funds for what it wanted. Myth making and propaganda continued until Russia's reluctant 1914 defensive mobilization became seen as a cause of the war, and the idea was bruited that somehow Europe just slid into war, though only Germany and Austria actively pursued one, with the former able to veto the latter.

	In any event, the was no doubt about who was responsible for the Versailles treaty. On January 5, 1918, Lloyd Goerge said, "We can no longer submit the future of European civilization to the arbitrary decisions of a few negotiators, striving to secure by chicanery or persuasion, the interests of this or that dynasty or nation."

	...

	However, it is time--and past time--to abandon old myths and simplistic propaganda-driven explanations and to address instead the inherent problems and the real reasons why this cornerstone of the interwar era has for so long attracted torrents of criticism despite the contrary opinion of those who know it best.

	Last summer, as President Vladimir Putin annexed the Crimea (with its Russian-speaking majority) and began to apply pressure on Ukraine (with its Russian-speaking minority), I was completing my reading of Michael Carley’s book Silent Conflict in preparation for the H-Diplo roundtable on his book that I was asked to introduce. Foreign affairs specialists in the West have debated the true motivations of the current Russian strongman for undertaking this daring set of foreign policies. Is he a pragmatic realist defending his country’s vital national interests against a U.S.-backed European Union intent on luring Ukraine into the West’s orbit at Russia’s expense with the siren song of market capitalism and political democracy?  Or is he a Russophile ideologue driven by a messianic belief in the mission of expanding his country’s borders as far westward as possible?

Promoting each other?

On the occasions when he met with agents, Mr. Montefiore points out, Stalin was receiving rather than giving intelligence.

	Vladimir L'vovich Burtsev (Russian: Владимир Львович Бурцев; November 17, 1862 – August 21, 1942), was a revolutionary activist, scholar, publisher and editor of several Russian language periodicals. He became famous by exposing a great number of agents provocateurs, notably Yevno Azef in 1908. Because of his own revolutionary activities and his harsh criticism of the imperial regime, including personal criticism of emperor Nicholas II, he was imprisoned several times in various European countries. In the course of his life, Burtsev fought oppressive policies from Tsarism in Imperial Russia, followed by the Bolsheviks and later Adolf Hitler's National Socialism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_Vereinigung
	The Aufbau Vereinigung (Reconstruction Organisation) was a Munich-based counterrevolutionary conspiratorial group formed in the aftermath of the German occupation of the Ukraine in 1918 and of the Latvian Intervention of 1919. It brought together White Russian émigrés and early German National Socialists who aimed to overthrow the governments of Germany and the Soviet Union, replacing them with authoritarian régimes of the far right.

	The most important leaders of the far-right in Russian politics in the years before the First World War were Dubrovin, Nicholas Markov, known as Markov II, and Vladimir Purishkevich, who founded a mystically-inclined successor organization to the Union of the Russian People in 1908, the Union of the Archangel Michael. Cohn asserts that the members of the Union of the Russian People and their successors “were in fact the true precursors of the Nazis” since they believed that Jews formed a capitalist-revolutionary conspiracy aimed at world dictatorship and they advocated extreme means of solving the “Jewish question,” such as deportation or even extermination. Markov II predicted in a 1911 speech in the Duma, or parliament, “All the Yids, down to the very last, will be killed.’”

	The greatest piece of “evidence”  that right-wing Russian elements used to support their assertions of a Jewish world-conspiracy came in the form of a vitriolic tract best known as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. ...The Protocols were most likely fabricated in 1897 or 1898 in Paris.  The Protocols critique liberalism, claiming that it is a tool for the Jews to gain world-domination by fomenting discontent and revolt so that they can use the ensuing chaos to establish a Jewish despot to rule over the world.

	...It is important to note that the Protocols were not widely distributed in pre-Revolutionary Russian society, even in reactionary circles. They were not "discovered" until after the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution, after which they were widely distributed among the "White" forces during the Russian Civil War.

White émigré Aufbau members
significantly influenced Hitler’s political, military, and ideological views.
Aufbau shaped early National Socialist strategies for combating both the
Weimar Republic and the Soviet Union. The conspiratorial organization
under Scheubner-Richter, who served as Hitler’s close counselor and foreign
policy advisor, sought to form an international alliance headed by nation-
alist and even National Socialist Germans and Russians (actually Russians,
Ukrainians, and Baltic peoples) against the Entente, the Weimar Repub-
lic, and “Jewish Bolshevism.” Aufbau goaded a doomed putsch against the
Weimar Republic under Hitler and Ludendorff. Finally, Aufbau warned
the early National Socialist movement that “Jewish Bolshevism” posed an
apocalyptic danger that threatened to engulf Germany, Europe, and even
the entire world.



http://bookfi.net/dl/548070/5d8658
Rollin investigated the National Socialist
belief, which was taken primarily from White émigré views, that a vast
Jewish-Masonic conspiracy had provoked World War I, toppled the Rus-
sian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires, and unleashed Bolshevism
after undermining the existing order through the insidious spread of liberal
ideas. German forces promptly destroyed Rollin’s work in 1940 after they
occupied France, and the book has remained in obscurity ever since.


Sounds like the "blame what they do on somebody else usually the jews" trick they still use today?

A German expert on the Protocols, Michael Hagemeister, has

Russian authorities only admitted to possessing files looted from
Germany and declassified them in 1991 after the Soviet Union had collapsed.
Historians were allowed to investigate the huge archival collection at the
Center for the Preservation of Historical-Documentary Collections, which
had become part of the Russian State Military Archives by the time I exam-
ined materials there in 1999–2001. 35 I was temporarily denied access to the
former Center in March 2001, likely as part of the chilled American–Russian
relations that arose after the February 2001 arrest of the FBI operative Robert
Hanssen as a double agent for both the Soviets and the Russians.

Interesting. I wonder if they forged any of the documents?

Regret-
tably, many State Commissioner files, most likely including one devoted
specifically to Aufbau, have long been housed at the Sluzhba vneshnoi
razvetki (Foreign Intelligence Service), where historians are not allowed to
examine them. As a further hindrance, Russian authorities “temporarily”
transferred the remaining State Commissioner documents there during the
summer of 2001, fortunately after I had examined them thoroughly. I believe
that I am the last Western scholar to investigate these valuable materials.

Sounds like they want to keep it secret



http://bookfi.net/dl/548070/5d8658
Chapter Eight analyzes Aufbau’s early ideological contributions to
National Socialism. Hitler, who only began to develop intense anti-
Bolshevik and anti-Semitic beliefs in late 1919 in the context of völkisch
German–White émigré interaction, learned a great deal from his early
mentor Eckart and three Aufbau members: Scheubner-Richter, Vinberg,
and Rosenberg. These ideological comrades served as the “four writers
of the apocalypse.” They influenced National Socialist ideology by adding
White émigré conspiratorial-apocalyptic anti-Semitism to existing völkisch-
redemptive notions of Germanic spiritual and racial superiority.
In the vein of Dostoevskii, the four writers of the apocalypse argued
that a sinister worldwide Jewish conspiracy manipulated the twin evils of
rapacious finance capitalism and bloodthirsty Bolshevism. They excori-
ated what they regarded as “Jewish Bolshevism.” The ideological quartet
warned that “Jewish Bolshevism” had killed many millions of Russians in
general, and, in a more sinister manner, had exterminated Russia’s nation-
alist intelligentsia. They emphasized that “Jewish Bolsheviks” threatened
to annihilate the German nationalist intelligentsia and to slaughter many
millions of other Germans in their bloody quest to achieve tyrannical world
rule. While Bolshevism horrified him, Rosenberg nonetheless learned from
what he perceived as its brutal method of eliminating political enemies. The
four writers of the apocalypse radicalized the early National Socialist Party
by warning that the “Jewish Bolshevik” peril threatened to pass from world
conquest to world destruction.

Russians out of nowhere really interested in conspiracy theories



http://bookfi.net/dl/548070/5d8658
Rosenberg, Schickedanz, and Biskupskii held high posts in the Third
Reich. Hitler and Rosenberg continued to use Ukrainian separatists under
Poltavets-Ostranitsa to undermine the Soviet Union. Hitler’s insistence on
winning the Ukraine for Germany in the vein of Aufbau during World War
II led him to divert powerful formations of the German Army southwards
away from Moscow in 1941, with disastrous military results.



http://bookfi.net/dl/548070/5d8658
As the State Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, Rosenberg aided
Hitler in his dual crusades against Bolshevism and Jewry, which the Führer
often combined into a single struggle against “Jewish Bolshevism.”

So guessing the plan was: blame what they did on the jews, then create a great evil to oppose them so they look like the good guys and have an excuse to invade Europe?


Maybe the birth of the "protocols" was the birth of the bolsheviks? That Jews ended up in banking positions in Europe, Jewish diaspora was everywhere, and Jews were frequent targets of racism would make them an ideal scapegoat from the kind of things the bolsheviks and Okhrana do.

https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-71351717/forgery-or-genuine-document
	Recent rulings about forgery cases have helped terminate a number of thorny controversies. In 1993 a Russian court finally ruled that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were forged by Tsar Nicholas II's secret police, the Okhrana. The decision was made by a three-member panel of academic `wise-men'. After extensive inquiries, they concluded that the book, which suggested a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to overthrow Christian civilisation, was a reworking of an original text containing no such claims. An equally sinister scandal, with both anti-Semitic and homophobic undercurrents, involved Alfred Dreyfus, the army captain banished to Devil's island after a highly publicised trial in 1894. His conviction was based largely on incriminating documents found in a wastepaper basket. In 1995 the French army finally admitted that Dreyfus was innocent. 

russian court ruled protocols forger in 1993? admits they were by the Okhrana? weird

Many anti-Bolshevik and
anti-Semitic White émigrés contributed extensively to the rise and develop-
ment of National Socialism in Germany. They affected aggressive National
Socialist political and military strategies, provided Hitler with extensive
funding, influenced National Socialist ideology by warning apocalyptically
of impending “Jewish Bolshevik” destruction, and helped to spur the Final
Solution.

Proponents
of völkisch thought believed the German people to be an autonomous
agent above the state largely because of its transcendental essence. 1 Völkisch
ideas developed from German Romanticism, which opposed parliamen-
tarianism, Westernism, and the Jewish spirit. Völkisch theorists rejected the
modern, liberal, and capitalist world they associated with soulless Western Zivilisation (civilization) in favor of an organic and spiritual Gemeinschaft
(community). Völkisch ideologues equated Jews with an essentially perni-

	The illusions were many. Hitler saw only Communist Russia and not the enduring, intensely patriotic people whose faith in Mother Russia had survived both czars and commissars. The prospect that many Russians would rally to the support of the Germans was overrated by the Nazi leadership. 

??? didn't they have to shoot them to stop them from deserting?

Is this propaganda?

http://www.realclearhistory.com/2016/10/01/what_if_moscow_had_fallen_to_hitler_5039.html

	The elimination of the Kiev pocket on September 26 bagged 665,000 men, more than 3,000 artillery pieces, and almost 900 tanks. But it delayed the resumption of major operations against Moscow until early autumn. This, many historians argue, was a fatal blunder.

	Yet, as historian David M. Glantz points out, such a scenario ignores what the Soviet armies around Kiev might have done had they not been trapped, and introduces too many variables to make for a good counterfactual. The best "minimal rewrite" of history must therefore focus on the final German bid to seize Moscow, an offensive known as Operation Typhoon.

Why is Mr. Glantz the odd man out?

http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/failures.htm
	Who then is at fault for this unbalanced view? Western historians who wrote on the war from only the German perspective deserve part of the blame. But they would argue, correctly, that they did so because they used the only sources available. Blame can also be ascribed to the natural influences of ethnocentrism, which conditions a people to appreciate only what they have experienced. These tendencies, however, only partially explain the unbalanced Western perception of the war. Perhaps the greatest factor contributing to our unbalanced view of the war is the collective failure of Soviet historiography to present Western (and Soviet) readers and scholars with a credible account of the course of war. Ideology, political motivation, and shibboleths born of the Cold War have often combined to inhibit the work and warp the perceptions of many Soviet historians.

	While many detailed Soviet works on the war display sound scholarship and are accurate, unfortunately the most general and most accessible to Western readers tended to be the most biased, the most highly politicized, and the least accurate. Even the soundest works have been vetted ideologically, and the authors have been forced to write their accounts with the narrowest of focuses. These realities undercut the credibility of these works (fairly or unfairly), permitted German historiography and interpretation to prevail, and, coincidentally, damaged the credibility of those few Western writers who incorporated Soviet historical materials into their accounts of the war. These stark historiographical realities also explain why, today, sensational, unfair, and wildly inaccurate accounts of aspects of the war so attract the Western reading public.

	This bleak general description of the state of German-Soviet War historiography, while essentially correct, must, of course, be qualified somewhat. Soviet historiography has not been universally bad, Western works have always existed which challenge the German view, and these works are now growing in number and their credibility is improving in the eyes of Western readers.

	...Investigation of all of these issues and others will cast more accurate light on the war and will help dispel the many myths that the war has produced, myths which have and will continue to victimize the Soviet (Russian) Army and Soviet (Russian) historiography. In the final analysis, the old axiom remains correct -- that it is better to relate one's own history than to have someone else relate it. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_offensive_plans_controversy
	The Soviet offensive plans controversy refers to the debate among historians on the question of whether Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was planning to attack Axis forces in Eastern Europe prior to Operation Barbarossa.

	While most agree that Stalin made extensive preparations for an eventual war and exploited the military conflict in Europe to his advantage, the assertions that he planned to attack Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941, and that Barbarossa was a preemptive strike by Adolf Hitler, are generally discounted according to David M. Glantz.[1] However most historians agree that war between the Soviet Union and the Axis was inevitable due to their vast ideological differences.

	...David M. Glantz disputes the argument that the Red Army was deployed in an offensive stance in 1941. According to Glantz, the Red Army was only in a state of partial mobilization in July 1941, from which neither effective defensive or offensive actions could be offered without considerable delay.

	I would suggest Mark's influence is a great part of how Glantz styled this trilogy, specifically this second volume (although the scale is much greater). Since I know the documents he is working with, mainly for the Soviet side but also a few sources for the German, I understand how difficult and time consuming it must have been to dig through all of the research at his disposal to put together such a narrative. This is by far the most interesting book I've read by Glantz. Granted, it is dry reading at times, but before reading this second volume I can honestly say my view of the battle at Stalingrad was greatly lacking.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_World_War_II#Eastern_Front

Why is this "german sources" meme popping up everywhere?

http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/a-new-weapon-in-russias-arsenal-and-its-inflatable/
	Col. David Glantz, an expert on Russian disguise operations, said Russia viewed war “in many, many facets.”

	Other militaries use decoys. The Russian doctrine of maskirovka, though, differs from deception operations by other major militaries in its blending of strategic and tactical deception, and in its use in both war and peace.

	In one storied example, the Soviets decided to call their space launchpad Baikonur, after a small Kazakh settlement of that name a few hundred miles away, hoping that in an attack, enemy bombers might hit the insignificant village by mistake.

	“They look at war as chess, and we look at it as checkers,” said Glantz, a former professor at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.


http://russia-insider.com/en/yes-russia-still-ready-war-even-nuclear-war/5324
	I STILL very much believe that Russia is ready for war.  And by “ready” I mean two things:

    Russia is morally and psychologically willing to use military force to defend herself against the Empire
    Russia has the military means to defend herself against the Empire

	I fully agree with a recent article on Russia Insider entitled “NATO Would Probably Lose A War Against Russia“.  I don’t know who “Shellback” who wrote this article is, but I can immediately recognize a fellow “cold warrior” who, like me, must have spent many hours studying the works of V.G. Reznichenko and David Glantz and who knows what he is talking about.

The Role of Lend-Lease in Allied Victory:
	Another controversial Allied contribution to the war effort was the Lend-Lease program of aid to the Soviet Union. Although Soviet accounts have routinely belittled the significance of Lend-Lease in sustaining the Soviet war effort, the overall importance of this assistance cannot be understated. Lend-Lease aid did not arrive in sufficient quantities to make the difference between defeat and victory in 1941-42; that achievement must be attributed solely to the Soviet people and to the iron nerve of Stalin, Zhukov, Shaposhnikov, Vasilevsky, and their subordinates.


http://sti.clemson.edu/publications-mainmenu-38/commentaries-mainmenu-211/cat_view/33-strom-thurmond-institute/153-sti-publications-by-subject-area/158-history
	Despite its massive scale, scope, cost, and global impact, it is indeed ironic that much of the Soviet Union’s Great Patriotic War remains obscure and imperfectly understood by Westerners and Russians alike. Worse still, this obscurity and misunderstanding has perverted the history of World War II overall by masking the Red Army’s and Soviet State’s contributions to ultimate Allied victory.


http://sti.clemson.edu/publications-mainmenu-38/commentaries-mainmenu-211/cat_view/33-strom-thurmond-institute/153-sti-publications-by-subject-area/158-history
	Even those who are better informed about the details of the Soviet-German War share in these common misperceptions. While they know more about the major battles that occurred during the war and have read about others such as von Manstein’s counterstroke in the Donbas and at Khar’kov, the fights in the Cherkassy Pocket and at Kamenets-Podolsk, the collapse of Army Group Center, and Soviet perfidy at the gates of Warsaw, the very terminology they use to describe these struggles is indicative of an understanding based primarily on German sources. More important, most laymen readers and historians alike lack sufficient knowledge and understanding of the Soviet-German War to fit it into the larger context of World War II and to understand its relative importance and regional and global significance.
	
	Who then is at fault for promoting this unbalanced view of the war? Certainly Western historians who wrote about the war from only the German perspective share part of the blame. However, they argue with considerable justification that they did so because only German sources were available to them. Ethnocentrism, a force that conditions a people to appreciate only that which they have themselves experienced, has also helped produce this unbalanced view of the war; in fact, it has done so on both sides.

	...The distorted view of The Economic Consequences of the Peace and J. M. Keyne's other works still dominates both the Anglo-American historical profession and the English-speaking educated public

	...As Steiner observed, the German view of the treaty has prevailed, especially among nonexperts in the English-speaking world, thanks to prolonged, intense Anglo-German propaganda, including Keyne's brilliant but warped polemic. 


http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/21/arts/a-job-for-rewrite-stalin-s-war.html
	For the most part, then, scholars were forced to rely heavily on German sources, which presented an extremely distorted view of events. 


http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/seven-questions-for-benjamin-schwarz/
	Schwarz: First, I should make clear that (a) I believe that America is neither an exceptional nor an indispensible nation and (b) I’m a patriot. Love of country, as Orwell said, implies for better, for worse. I’m a patriot because this is my country, I feel deeply rooted in it, and I could never be at home anywhere else. But I don’t think our history shows us as any better—or any worse —than many other countries.  ...No doubt Vladimir Putin sees America’s protestations over his pursuit of what he perceives as his country’s security interest as little more than the smug and aggressive braying of insufferable hypocrites.

	Guilt trip: Versailles, avant-garde & kitsch

	by Roger Kimball

	Perhaps this is the place to note how close Keynes was to the German parties of the Treaty. As Niall Ferguson points out in The Pity of War, Keynes was deeply attached to Carl Melchior, Max Warburg’s right-hand man ... Posterity has not, Ferguson notes, appreciated “the extent to which Keynes was manipulated by his German friends” or “the extent to which he erred in his analysis of the consequences of the peace.”


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Germany
	The blockade was maintained for eight months after the Armistice in November 1918, into the following year of 1919. According to the New Cambridge Modern History food imports into Germany were controlled by the Allies after the Armistice with Germany until Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919.

	C. Paul Vincent maintains that for the German people, these were the most devastating months of the blockade because "in the weeks and months following the armistice, Germany's deplorable state further deteriorated" However, Sally Marks believes that the German accounts of a hunger blockade are a "myth".


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AWorld_War_I_reparations
	This article seems to have been the target of POV pushing. Note especially these two sets of edits: [1], [2].

    The first enlarged the article from 17,243 bytes to 37,476 bytes and, some minor copyediting aside, the enlargement is almost exclusively due to stating over and over again that the Germans could have paid the reparations and did not do so out of political calculations.

    The second doubled the section titled "As viewed within Germany", such that now 1/2 of the section consists of a story about planned French (and allied) reparation to be paid to Germany (totally unrelated to the section title). Another 1/4th is made up describing the view of the tiniest minority of Germans (It would be interesting if there are any other contemporary German sources at all putting forward that view), leaving only 1/4 to the actual view that was shared by virtually all Germans at the time.

	The POV pushing can also be learned from the sources used: John Maynard Keynes, eminent economist and financial representative for England in Versailles is used for 3 sentences. Meanwhile Sally Marks (who is that?) is used as a source a whooping 43(!) times, for a total of several paragraphs. The unknown french economist Étienne Mantoux is also cited at length to disprove Keynes calculations (a ridiculous excercise, since data is taken from years when the original reparations had already been reduced).

It's like they want to debate it to add to the mystique or something? you could see them doing that even 100 years ago, like Kellog says

Protocols seems designed to rely on anti-semitism. Because it alleges a global conspiracy, for people who hate jews, motivated reasoning will cause them to see efforts to discount it as proof of the conspiracy. So it's kindof a "trap" in that way, and anti-semitism is what makes it work.

Why I don't get is: if the Ohkrana and now the FSB were clever enough to think of that, why are they falling into the same trap? people say "oh the Russians are spreading propaganda and bullshit everywhere" and their propaganda is easy to spot and just proves their point.

They might have thought the Protocols would provide cover, but nobody believes in that anymore except a few loons. They also try to blame things on the CIA and America, which I guess is their new cover, but it looks mostly like muddying the waters than blaming any one specific secretive organization.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria#Japanese
	The invasion of Manchuria contributed to the surrender of Japan and the end of World War II. In addition, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria, along with the northern portions of the Korean Peninsula allowed for those regions to be transferred by the Soviet Union into the control of communist backed regimes. The control of these regions by communist governments backed by Soviet authorities would aid in the rise of Communist China and shape the political conflict of the Korean War.


http://www.nww2m.com/2011/10/fdr-approves-building-an-atomic-bomb-70th-anniversary-october-9-1941/
	Vannevar Bush had received a joint doctoral degree in engineering from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1917. He then worked for the National Research Council, applying science to warfare, during the Great War. He joined the faculty at MIT, became a Dean and Vice President of engineering there, founded the industrial American Appliance Corporation (named Raytheon today), developed an analog computer, worked on defense contract work, and in 1939 accepted the presidency of the Carnegie Institute in Washington from which post he administered grants to promising scientific research. Bush took the lead on pushing the project. Through his persuasive powers and contacts with Roosevelt’s aid Harry Hopkins, he received an appointment with the President on June 12, 1940. His incisive and informed nature helped build trust between him and the President; Roosevelt liked that Bush was clear and concise in his analysis of the situation and direction that needed to be taken, and his serious and businesslike demeanor. Bush emerged from the meeting with Roosevelt with a new National Defense Research Committee, under which the Briggs Committee would pursue research, and organized with Bush himself installed as chairman.

Did they want FDR to build the bomb?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AMukden_Incident
	Soviet Russia and its division of Communist Party of China (CPC) tried to create Soviet region in Manchuria by planed riot of December 11, 1930. But in November 9, Japanese police copped them and got many their documents. After 1932, Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs started to publish the book of "The history of Communist Party of China". Here is the book of 1934 version: http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=Jtlw6SdJGUUC&pg=frontcover . the book says the general meeting of CPC central executive committee did not open for 3 years after January 1931. some primary sources are on Japanese Wikipedia but I don't know any good English resources or even Japanese resources. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War
	Russia suffered numerous defeats by Japan, but Tsar Nicholas II was convinced that Russia would win and chose to remain engaged in the war; at first, to await the outcomes of certain naval battles, and later to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a "humiliating peace". The war concluded with the Treaty of Portsmouth, mediated by US President Theodore Roosevelt. The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised world observers. The consequences transformed the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. It was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a European one. Scholars continue to debate the historical significance of the war.

What was Roosvelt's involvement? Another reason for them to dislike America?

	This was the first major military victory in the modern era of an Asian power over a European nation. Russia's defeat was met with shock in the West and across the Far East. Japan's prestige rose greatly as it came to be seen as a modern nation. Concurrently, Russia lost virtually its entire Pacific and Baltic fleets, and also much international esteem. This was particularly true in the eyes of Germany and Austria-Hungary before World War I. Russia was France's and Serbia's ally, and that loss of prestige had a significant effect on Germany's future when planning for war with France, and Austria-Hungary's war with Serbia.

	In the absence of Russian competition, and with the distraction of European nations during World War I, combined with the Great Depression that followed, the Japanese military began efforts to dominate China and the rest of Asia, which eventually led to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War theatres of World War II.

	...

	Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy.[93] Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000–300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest.[94] Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement (in particular, Józef Piłsudski) sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising.[95]

	In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.

	Most of the Bolsheviks’ knowledge of intelligence and counterintelligence came from their own experiences with the Okhrana, the tsarist security police, who had often used double agents to infiltrate the revolutionary movements in Russia. A young protégé of Lenin was among these agents, as the Bolsheviks discovered when they opened the Okhrana files, and some have always thought Stalin himself may have been as well.


https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol6no2/html/v06i2a08p_0001.htm

https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000608439.pdf
	In addition, there were numerous anti-Communist White Russians in northern Manchuria willing and able to engage in intelligence activities for the Japanese.

	...The principal field intelligence units under the Intelligence Section of the Kwantung Army staff were eight Army Special Services Agencies. Of these it was the unit in Harbin which played the major role in the Manchurian operations. The Harbin ASSA used White Russians for espionage missions and these were the best of the agents available. The border area ASSA's occasionally used White Russians, but relied mainly on local Chinese and Koreans.

	...The importance of available Soviet publications, primarily newspapers published in the Far East, had somewhat belatedly become apparent to the Japanese, and the few publican analysts originally assigned to the Harbin ASSA had been agumented and formed into the Document Intelligence Division. Its staff included a large number of White Russian intellectuals, as well as Japanese competent to interpret and analyze Soviet documents, publications and messages.


https://www.gwern.net/docs/terrorism/1989-andrew.pdf
	The KGB also penetrated and subverted the Paris headquarters of the remnants of the White Armies that had been defeated in the Civil War. The climax of that penetration was the kidnap and assassination of two successive heads of the White Guards, General Aleksandr Kutyepov in 1930 and General Yevgeny Miller in 1937. Emigre Trotskyists were penetrated, undermined, and their leaders assassinated in almost identical fashion. The chief aide of Trotsky's son, Lev Sedov, the main Trotskyist organiser in Western Europe, was the KGB agent, Mark Zborowski. Sedov was liquidated in 1938, followed by several other leading Trotskyists and finally by the great heretic himself in Mexico in 1940.

	By the 1930s, however, the most important targets of KGB penetration operations were Western governments and official bureaucracies. The highest-level penetration was probably in France. Ultimately the most important, however, was in Britain. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Russians#Japanese_occupation
	The anti-Communist Harbin Russians formed the Russian Fascist Party (RFP). The RFP was anti-semitic and harassed the Jewish Harbin Russians with, among other things, kidnappings, and many Russian Jews therefore left Harbin. In 1934, the Japanese formed the Bureau for Russian Emigrants in Manchuria (BREM; Бюро по делам российских эмигрантов в Маньчжурской империи), which were nominally under the control of RFP; the BREM provided identification papers necessary to live, work and travel in Manchukuo. White General Vladimir Kislitsin acted as BREM's chairman between 1938 and 1942. Ataman Grigory Semyonov, himself much in favor with the Japanese, replaced him from 1943 to 1945.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Fascist_Party
	By cooperating with Japan, the RFP became the most influential émigré group in Manchukuo, setting up a party school in Harbin in 1932.[2] Rodzaevsky also assisted the Imperial Japanese Army in the formation of the Asano Detachment, the all ethnic Russian special forces in the Kwantung Army, organized for carrying out sabotage against Soviet forces in case of any Japanese invasion of Siberia and Russian Far East areas.

	...Nevertheless, the RFP under Rodzaevsky had grown strong and claimed 20,000 activists by May 1935. Subsidiaries of the RFP were set up - Russian Women's Fascist Movement (RGFD), Fascist Union of Youth, Union of Young Fascists – Vanguard (boys), Union of Young Fascists – Vanguard (girls), Union of Fascist Little Ones. Rodzaevsky's book, The Russian National State, outlined the programme of the party to establish fascism in Russia by May 1, 1938, including a desire to get rid of the Jews, indicating a strong break from the Vonsyatsky-wing. The party also had a strong commitment to the Russian Orthodox Church, promising a special relationship between the Church and the state in his projected fascist Russia. The group also promised to respect the traditions of Russia's nationalities and instigate corporatism.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rodzaevsky
	Their main military acts involved the training of Asano Detachment, the all ethnic-Russian special forces in the Kwantung Army, organized for carrying out sabotage against Soviet forces in case of any Japanese invasion of Siberia and Russian Far East areas; Japan was apparently interested in creating a White Russian state in Outer Manchuria.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Rodzaevsky
	Born in Blagoveshchensk (across the Amur from China) in a family of the Siberian middle-class, he fled the Soviet Union for Manchuria in 1925. In Harbin, Rodzaevsky entered the law academy and joined the Russian Fascist Organization. On May 26, 1931, he became the Secretary General of the newly created Russian Fascist Party; in 1934 the Party amalgamated with the Russian Fascist Organization of Anastasy Vonsyatsky, Rodzaevsky becoming its leader. He modeled himself on Benito Mussolini, and also used the Swastika as one of the symbols of the movement.

	Rodzaevsky collected around himself personally selected bodyguards, and used symbolism of the former Russian Empire along with Russian nationalist symbols; like the Italian Blackshirts, the Russian Fascists wore black uniforms with black crossed belts; they were armed with weapons obtained from Japan's Imperial Japanese Army. They created an international organization of White émigrés with a central office in Harbin, the "Russian Far East Moscow", and links in twenty-six nations around the world. The most important of these international posts was in New York City.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ichi-Go
	With the rapid deterioration of the Chinese front after Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, General Joseph Stilwell saw this as an opportunity to win his political struggle against Chiang Kai-shek, China's leader, and gain full command of all Chinese armed forces. He was able to convince General George Marshall to have President Franklin D. Roosevelt send an ultimatum to Chiang threatening to end all American aid unless Chiang "at once" placed Stilwell "in unrestricted command of all your forces."

     
	...Atkinson, who had visited Mao Zedong in the communist capital of Yenan, saw his Communist Chinese forces as a democratic movement (after Atkinson visited Mao, his article on his visit was titled Yenan: A Chinese Wonderland City), and the Nationalists in turn as hopelessly reactionary and corrupt. This view was shared by many U.S. journalists in China at the time, but due to pro-Chiang Allied press censorship, it was not as well known to their readers until Stilwell's recall and the ensuing anti-Chiang coverage forced it into the open.

	...Operation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected. Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go.

	The Imperial Japanese Navy did not contribute to the defense of Manchuria, the occupation of which it had always opposed on strategic grounds. Additionally, by the time of the invasion, the few remnants of its fleet were stationed and tasked with the defense of the Japanese home island in the event of an invasion by American forces.

	Compounding the problem, the Japanese military made many wrong assumptions and major mistakes, the two most significant being:

	...However, although this redeployment had been initiated, it was not due to be completed until September, and hence the Kwantung Army were in the midst of redeploying when the Soviets launched their attack simultaneously on all three fronts.

	...The invasion of Manchuria contributed to the surrender of Japan and the end of World War II. In addition, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria, along with the northern portions of the Korean Peninsula allowed for those regions to be transferred by the Soviet Union into the control of communist backed regimes. The control of these regions by communist governments backed by Soviet authorities would aid in the rise of Communist China and shape the political conflict of the Korean War.

	...Many Japanese settlers committed mass suicide as the Soviet army approached. Mothers were forced to kill their own children before killing or being killed themselves. The Japanese army often took part in the killings of its civilians. The commander of the 5th Japanese Army, General Shimizu, commented that "each nation lives and dies by its own laws." Wounded Japanese soldiers who were incapable of moving on their own were often left to die as the army retreated.[21]

	The Soviets laid claim to Japanese enterprises in the region and took valuable materials and industrial equipment.[22]

	British and US reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Manchuria (about 700,000) looted and terrorized the people of Mukden, and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage". In Harbin, Chinese posted slogans such as "Down with Red Imperialism!" Soviet forces ignored protests from Chinese communist party leaders on the mass rape and looting.


	Konstantin Asmolov of the Center for Korean Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences dismisses Western accounts of Soviet violence against civilians in the Far East as exaggeration and rumor and contends that accusations of mass crimes by the Soviet army inappropriately extrapolate isolated incidents regarding the nearly 2,000,000 Soviet troops in the Far East into mass crimes. According to him, such accusations are refuted by the documents of the time, from which it is clear that such crimes were far less of a problem than in Germany. Asmolov further asserts that the Soviets prosecuted their perpetrators while prosecution of Soviet "rapists and looters" in Germany was virtually unknown.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the FBI arrested over 120
0 Japanese aliens throughout 
the United States. Over the next several weeks, President Roosevelt received contradictory advice about 
further action. 
FDR’s military advisers recommended the exclusion of persons of foreign descent, including American 
citiz
ens, from sensitive areas of the country as a safeguard against espionage and sabotage. The Justice 
Department initially resisted any relocation order, questioning both its military necessity and its 
constitutionality. 
But the shock of Pearl Harbor and o
f Japanese atrocities in the Philippines fueled already tense race 
relations on America’s West Coast. In the face of political, military, and public pressure, Roosevelt 
accepted the relocation proposal. The Attorney General acquiesced after the War Departm
ent relieved 
the Justice Department of any responsibility for implementation.

	Sun Yat-sen's efforts to obtain aid from the Western countries were ignored, however, and in 1921 he turned to the Soviet Union. For political expediency the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Communist Party of China, which would eventually found the People's Republic of China. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai
	On 20 March 1913, while traveling to Beijing, Song Jiaoren was shot by a lone gunman in Shanghai, and died two days later. The trail of evidence led to the secretary of the cabinet and the provisional premier of Yuan's government. Although Yuan was considered by contemporary Chinese media sources as the man most likely behind the assassination, the main conspirators investigated by authorities were either themselves assassinated or disappeared mysteriously. For lack of evidence, Yuan was never officially implicated.[14]

	The Chinese Assassination Corps (or China Assassination Corps , Chinese : 支那暗殺團 ) was an anarchist group, active in China during the final years of the Qing dynasty . One of the first organized anarchist movements in China and fiercely anti-Manchu , it aimed to overthrow the Aisin Gioro and the Empire of China through the use of revolutionary terror. History In 1910, the left-wing Tongmenghui nationalist (and later anti-communist pro-Japanese collaborator and President of the Reorganized National Government of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War ) Wang Jingwei , who had been influenced by Russian anarchism while studying in Japan , planned to assassinate Prince-Regent Chun (father of the young Xuantong Emperor ). The plan, which was to be carried out in April, failed as Wang and his associates were arrested in Beijing in March. In response to the plot's failure, the Chinese Assassination Corps was formed later the same year to carry on the imprisoned would-be assassins' mission. Founded in Hong Kong ,

	The entire operational program, with many alternative courses of action, was outlined for "Lyubova." She was to contact Austrian agents and deliver them instructions all along the way, as far as Vladivostok. From there she was to go on to Harbin and then proceed to Shanghai, where she should report to the German consulate.

	One wonders just how extensive the Okhrana operation was abroad. A police report from 1901 refers to a "great number of agents," and at the time of the Harting disclosures an ex-agent provided the press with a list of fifteen Paris operatives. These included former French, German, and Scotland Yard policemen. After the revolution, former Okhrana officials reduced to writing their memoirs arged that only a handful of agents had been stationed abroad, occaisonally supplemented by flying squads out of Moscow and St. Petersburg. And yet the files of the Paris Okhrana office, which was the hub of Russian police operations in Europe, fill 216 boxes. These currently reside at the Hoover Institution and await their historian.

	In the spring of 1941, Stalin feared the Soviet Union would become trapped in the vise of a two-front war, crushed between Germany and Japan. To escape the trap, three separate Soviet intelligence operations in Chungking, Tokyo, and Washington, without knowledge of each other, manipulated Japan to attack American forces in the Pacific and bring the United States into World War II. In concerted covert efforts directed from Moscow, Soviet intelligence worked to divert Japanese expansionism south against "colonialist imperialism," so that Japan would take over French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), and American interests in the Philippines protected by the U.S. Navy, instead of pushing westward through Siberia. Stalin's desperate purpose was to fend off a unified, two-pronged attack by Germany and Japan that he feared would destroy the Soviet Union. Stalin's nightmare was a German-Japanese "handshake in the Urals." 


	...Retracing the reasons for Stalin's frenzy to push the Japanese to attack the United States reveals the answer to one of the great mysteries of the twentieth century. Both communist devotees of Stalin and anticommunist commentators have long wondered why Stalin entered a pact with the devil named Hitler, knowing what a dangerous ally he might become. The 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact of Non-Aggression, signed in August of that year, was a landmark on the path to World War II. The answer to the mystery: Stalin was already fighting the Japanese in the Far East and he feared a two-front war. 


	...In June of 1997, Oleg Tsarev, a Foreign Intelligence Service (Sluzhba Vneshni Razvedke (SVR), formerly KGB) officer turned historian, led a group of well-known Western writers and intelligence specialists on a "spy tour" of Moscow. The authors were among this group. Once everyone was seated on the bus, Tsarev began his presentation with the reassuring statement that in the late 1930s and the beginning of the 1940s, until the first efforts to develop the atomic bomb, "the United States was not a main target of Soviet intelligence except as a balance against Japan." That seemed an odd interpretation of events for any of his guests on the tour who had read the VENONA intercepts of Soviet cable traffic. They knew that the Soviet Union had more than 200 controlled agents in America at that time, many placed in the highest levels of the government. However, not one of the guests asked for further explanation of Tsarev's cryptic statement. 


http://www.raleighspyconference.com/speaker_bios/2008_schecter_bio.aspxA
	Mr. Schecter served on President Jimmy Carter's White House staff as associate White House press secretary and Spokesman for the National Security Council (1977-1980). From 1980 to 1982 he was vice president for public affairs of Occidental Petroleum Corporation reporting directly to Chairman Armand Hammer. In 1987 he organized the production of a documentary for Frontline titled Back in the USSR, the return of his family to Moscow after 17 years to report on the changes under Gorbachev's peristroika.


hmmm


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project
	The Venona project remained secret for more than fifteen years after it concluded, and some of the decoded Soviet messages were not declassified and published until 1995.


Sorge confession:

https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001289798.pdf
	Part of it was a straight-forward account of his espionage activities; other parts were evasive or deceptive. Most of the original manuscript confession was destroyed by fire caused by the air bombardment of Tokyo.


http://spartacus-educational.com/GERsorge.htm
	As a result of the information accumulated by the network Sorge was able to give Joseph Stalin advance warning about the Anti-Comintern Pact (1936), the German-Japanese Pact (1940) and Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour. His greatest achievement was to inform the Soviet Union in December, 1940, of the proposed Operation Barbarossa.

	Despite the efforts of Sorge, Joseph Stalin did not believe that the German Army would attack at that time and did not take the necessary action. As Leonard Trepper, the head of Red Orchestra, later pointed out: "The generalissimo preferred to trust his political instinct rather than the secret reports piled up on his desk. Convinced that he had signed an eternal pact of friendship with Germany, he sucked on the pipe of peace."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotsumi_Ozaki
	By writing books and articles Ozaki established himself as an expert in Sino-Japanese relations. Thus he was recruited by Ryūnosuke Gotō in 1937 to join the Shōwa Kenkyūkai, a think tank established by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. From 1938, he was invited by Konoe to become a member of his inner circle, or “Breakfast Club”, of select members with whom he would confer on current events each week over breakfast. Ozaki, therefore, was in a position to participate in the making of decisions he was supposed to uncover.[1]

	Ozaki learned that Japan wanted to avoid a war with the Soviet Union, and let Sorge know of it. This information proved to be of uttermost importance for the whole history of the Second World War: after Sorge relayed it to Soviet command, Moscow transferred 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East to the Western Front against the Nazi Germany during the most dangerous months of the Battle for Moscow, one of the turning points of the whole war.[citation needed]

	On July 2, 1941, Ozaki as a member of the "Breakfast Club" supported a critical decision for Japanese expansion towards the Dutch East Indies and Singapore and against Hitler's request to invade Siberia.[1] He was outspoken in his opposition and concerns with regards to the decision reached at the Gozen Kaigi conference of September 6, 1941 that war with the United States was unavoidable.

	Warned to stay away from the Japanese Communist Party, he brought in a radio operator, Red Army officer Max Clausen and his wife Anna (Clausen operated a blueprint machinery and reproduction business that was financed by the Soviets but which he made profitable)


	...History has viewed Sorge and his work very favorably. He is considered by most as the greatest Soviet spy and accorded accolades by some of the most prominent people involved in the war or clandestine activities. Said Douglas MacArthur, General fo the U.S. Army “[His was] a devastating example of a brilliant success of espionage.” Kim Philby said “his work was impeccable,” and writers Ian Fleming and Tom Clancy said, respectively, “Sorge was the man whom I regard as the most formidable spy in history” and “Richard Sorge was the best spy of all time.”

wtf? sorge sucks

seems like all he did was help make Stalin's operation barbarossa plan more awkward

Did he have anything to do with the Manchurian incident?


https://www.britannica.com/event/Mukden-Incident
	Responding to this pressure, officers of the Japanese Kwantung (Guandong) Army, which was stationed in Manchuria, initiated an incident in Mukden without the approval of the civil government of Japan.

	...On the night of September 18, 1931, Japanese troops used the pretext of an explosion along the Japanese-controlled South Manchurian Railway to occupy Mukden. On September 21, Japanese reinforcements arrived from Korea, and the army began to expand throughout northern Manchuria. In Tokyo neither the high command of the Japanese army nor Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō proved able to restrain the Kwangtung Army in the field, and within three months Japanese troops had spread throughout Manchuria. Wakatsuki’s cabinet fell in December, and its successor reacted to a growing tide of public opinion by sanctioning the invasion.

	...The Kwantung Army met little resistance in its conquests because Chiang Kai-shek, who was intent on establishing his control over the rest of China, ordered the commander of the Chinese forces in Manchuria, Zhang Xueliang, to pursue a policy of nonresistance and withdrawal. The League of Nations, Chiang announced, would determine the outcome of the case. The Lytton Commission, appointed by the league to investigate the situation, labeled Japan as the aggressor, but Japan withdrew from the league and continued to occupy Manchuria until 1945.

wtf?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_United_Front
	The Kuomintang gradually became a powerful and disciplined party under Russian guidance. The decisive factor was Bolshevik assistance to the Kuomintang in the formation of its own army, the National Revolutionary Army. In order to train the army the Whampoa Military Academy was established near Guangzhou. As its director, Sun appointed his loyal supporter Chiang Kai-shek. Financially the Whampoa Military Academy operated with the support of the Soviet Union. The quality of education was guaranteed by regularly visiting Russian officers. Many of the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party graduated from the academy--the chief commander of the People's Liberation Army, Lin Biao, graduated from Whampoa as did Zhou Enlai, who later became prime minister of Communist China.


https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=34079
	And one wonders how the diaries of Maj. Gen. Joseph Stilwell— who famously dubbed Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek “Peanut” and refers to him as “the little bastard”—were acquired.

	Who ordered his death? The official inquiry eventually ran cold. The ex-soldier who pulled the trigger and the men identified as hiring him, including the acting prime minister in Yuan’s cabinet, all mysteriously died or went missing within a year. Two were poisoned, another slain by a pair of swordsmen aboard a train.

	There was no shortage of people who might have wished Song gone. Ardent and self-assured, he had made many enemies both in the opposition and his own party. Liang Qichao (pictured left), the pre-eminent Chinese intellectual of the era, an erstwhile monarchist and at that moment a close ally of Yuan’s, was forced to deny a rumour that he was behind the assassination (according to sources dug up by John Delury, a historian). The Nationalist Party’s co-founder, Sun Yat-sen (top right), had been Song’s bitter rival for years; he opportunistically seized on the killing to foment a failed second revolution in a bid to regain control of the party.


https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Front-Chinese-history-1937-1945
	The first United Front was begun in 1924. In return for Soviet military and organizational aid, Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan), the leader of the KMT, agreed to a “bloc within” alliance in which CCP members joined the KMT as individuals while retaining their separate CCP memberships.

	Yet during the years that Pyongyang built up its nuclear program, Beijing never showed the urgency that seemed palpable in 2003. Today the fundamental logic of China's alliance with North Korea is not seriously challenged, at least not openly: A stable regime is better than a collapsed one on China's border, and North Korea is an effective buffer state between China and South Korea — and South Korea's patron protector, the United States. That may be perversely even more true now that North Korea is a nuclear weapons state, though China has consistently maintained that it wants a denuclearized Korean peninsula.

Assuming the info is accurate, interesting. Destroying their propaganda machine should be easy I think? They aren't hard to manipulate. And you ought to be able to riddle them with spies.

Arguably, some of the tecnhniques they use on us should be even easier on them. They have to lie about state control but we don't.

Word of mouth is harder to censor. Always make their jobs harder for them. A little can go a long way, like asymetric warfare.

	Sometimes online complaints do produce results, swiftly bringing offenders to book. When an army political commissar got abusive with a flight attendant, she posted photographs of the incident. Internet users soon ferreted out his name, job title and location and he was eased out of his job.

The commissar piss off someone rich? sounds like active measures if they use fake accounts too

	Small victories like this are becoming increasingly common, to the dismay of millions of Communist Party cadres. Many web users believe that the balance of power has shifted: in a survey conducted in 2010 by a magazine affiliated to the People’s Daily, the party mouthpiece, more than 70% of respondents agreed that local Chinese officials suffered from “internet terror”.

ya ok that's active measures. Just a way to control the officials.


get the sense that Okhrana is something more international? like a sort of organization influencing states. So they have heavy influence on China, Russia, and Eastern Eruope I guess. The Chinese and Russian propagandists would be fooled too, just like the Nazis were fooled. Just use blackmail, lies, and ideology to influence people to do what you want and keep power.

Having control of rumor mills on the internet would help amplify their blackmail. So with "internet terror" officials know they have to stay in line.

2 million propagandists? damn

What motivates them? for most there would probably be limits to what they say or the job would get too depressing.

Would guess they would try to tie patriotism with state worship e.g. Bush. The same problem of motivated reasoning between political parties in the U.S. applies to countries. So as long as they see the world as an "us vs them" of countries, motivated reasoning would influence them to see the state as good.

Maybe this is why Russian propaganda is divisive? a divided people are easier to control, and this applies even to the world.

	We begin by analyzing an archive of emails leaked from the Internet Propaganda Office of Zhanggong,

Interesting... where did the leaks come from?


	A theory consistent with these patterns is that the strategic objective of the regime is to distract and redirect public attention from discussions or events with collective action potential.

Sounds like what their network with Trump is doing right now

	specific, directed arguments that support the government, its leaders, and their policies, and  opposing  arguments  to  the  contrary;  they  do  this  by  engaging  in  debate  with  and criticism of China’s enemies, including those who oppose it inside the country and from abroad.

Russia's did do this with me... clearly there are different categories of propagandists

	In none of these cases are these people likely to be actually 50c party members.  

how would they know? article seems a bit revisionist...

problem is they extrapolate from their dataset to say "this is every propagandist in China and if you disagree your WRONG." but there could be more types than what was leaked. Clearly they would compartmentalize the more sensitive or politically damaging activities to make it easier to stop leaks or keep tabs on them (or have more stringent hiring practices, background checks, screening for the type of person willing to do this to their country)

timing of this article is interesting. Are they excepting something?

	The woman, Zhou Yumeng, had posted pictures on her Sina Weibo -- a microblogging service similar to Twitter -- showing injuries she said Fang inflicted, triggering uproar on China's popular social networking sites.

	State-run news agency Xinhua said Fang and his wife "stunk of alcohol" when they boarded the flight from the eastern city of Hefei to Guangzhou, and that Fang grabbed Zhou's arm hard enough to bruise it.

	"If it wasn't for us, you wouldn't even have food to eat," Fang's wife told Zhou, according to Xinhua.

	Officials in Guangzhou's Yuexiu district, where Fang is employed, said last week an internal investigation had found him innocent, but changed tack after Xinhua disputed their account.

	"Have you really conducted a comprehensive and objective investigation? Is what you found really what you published in the report?" Xinhua wrote in an unusually outspoken post to one of its Sina Weibo accounts.

	Fang and his wife have reportedly apologized to Zhou, and the incident has given rise to several commentaries in China's state-run media hailing the power of the Internet to restrain badly behaved officials.

http://news.trust.org//item/20120904105700-l1cv2/
	The Global Times, a popular tabloid owned by the Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, said reports of such incidents were spreading like wildfire online as conflict between citizens and local officials was increasing.

	Fang grabbed the air hostess's arms after yelling at her, the eyewitness said. "I had no idea if the grab hurt or not, but I saw scratches on her arms."

Grabbing someones arm doesn't bruise them like that...

	Yet sceptics believe the billionaire's execution is merely the latest chapter in a political purge of Mr Xi's rivals. Liu had connections to Zhou Yongkang, the disgraced former security chief who was recently expelled from the Communist Party and is awaiting sentencing for corruption. 

Some kind of power grab? I remember China had an "anti-corruption crackdown" like Russia


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Yongkang
Says Zhou was planning a coup?

	The new party leadership under Xi reportedly began planning the crackdown on Zhou beginning in 2012. Xi's 'tough talk' on corruption began immediately after his ascension to the post of General Secretary. In his first days in office, Xi vowed to crack down on "tigers and flies", meaning extremely powerful officials as well as petty ones. Xi moved quickly to set a new standard for expected behavior of party officials, issuing a series of guidelines to clean up the party bureaucracy. Xi may have also been concerned that Zhou might use his influence and power to turn various state security entities into tools for advancing his interests, and in the process undermine the central authority of the state.

	...Zhou's case was unprecedented, as no corruption investigation had ever been initiated against a member of the elite Politburo Standing Committee. 

	...Jiang subsequently applauded Xi's leadership skills during a visit by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

wat? what did he have to do with any of this?


http://fivebooks.com/interview/gady-epstein-on-china-and-the-internet/
	Where you wouldn’t be exposing corruption by lower level officials and you wouldn’t be hearing about mass protests all around the country?” He supposes that one-party rule would be more stable under those conditions. I disagree. In my view, allowing citizens to expose corrupt low-level officials or other wrongdoing that the centre maybe doesn’t even know about is in the centre’s interest. It gives people some sense of freedom and some real freedom, without necessarily challenging one-party rule.

	...In the case of anti-Japanese protests, it’s a little bit more complex than that. In some sense, that is allowing an existing online sentiment to express itself.

http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21574628-internet-was-expected-help-democratise-china-instead-it-has-enabled
	This is the online blueprint for what scholars call “adaptive authoritarianism”, and there is an international market for it. China sells its technological know-how abroad, including tools for monitoring and filtering the internet. Huawei and ZTE, two big Chinese companies, are leading suppliers of internet and telecoms hardware to a number of states in Central and South-East Asia, eastern Europe and Africa, including Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Belarus, Ethiopia and Zambia. Many of these would like to increase online access while retaining tight political and technological control. China has aligned itself with these countries and dozens of others, including Russia, in a global dispute with Western democracies over how the internet should be governed.

More exporting authoriatism abroad? I'm sure Mr. Epstein is delighted

	The policy of MI5 during the war was initially to use the system for counter-espionage. It was only later that its potential for deception purposes was realised. 

??? are you kidding? how is this not intuitive? I started doing this almost immediately...

Did Lenin do the same or was he Okhrana the whole time?

	Public perception in Britain was that the country was full of well trained German spies, who were deeply integrated into society. There was widespread "spy-mania", as Churchill put it.

Didn't the Russians try the same shit here? Blame the Germans on what they do

Okhrana and the Cheka

This thesis looks to fill this 
significant g
ap by investigating the major
continuities between the Tsarist Okhrana and 
the Soviet Cheka. 

Yet the Cheka quickly surpassed the size and authority its predecessor ever 
achieved.  The multiple threats the Bolshevik party faced, in addition to a general l
ack in 
legitimacy and popularity, Lenin came to heavily rely on Dzerzhinskii’s political police 
force to implement terror and coercion.

Yet, this culture 
was embraced, rather enthusiastically, by a regime that claimed to despise and hate
the 
autocracy.  
This early exposure to a proto
-
police state very much influenced the 
mentality, and to some extent the radicalization, of the revolutionaries.  Russian historian 
Orlando Figes concludes
that
“one can draw a straight line from the penal rig
ors of the 
Tsarist regime to the terrorism of the revolutionaries and indeed to the police state of the 
Bolsheviks.”
4
Identifying the continuities between the Tsarist and Soviet secret police is also 
significant because it highlights that the achievements
made by the Okhrana to the 
intelligence community are generally overlooked.  Again, the secret policing 
organizations under the Soviet regime are generally characterized as innovators in 
intelligence
-
gathering and experts at the tradecraft.  These charact
eristics, however, also 
accurately describe the Tsarist Okhrana, but hardly attributed to it in intelligence history.  
In the 1950s, the CIA correctly identified the importance of the Okhrana

a connection between Okhrana and the Green Gang? They operated in Shanghai and it sounds like the kind of organization they would like to influence (if not outright control)

http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1989/eirv16n30-19890728/eirv16n30-19890728.pdf
Says someone accused Kuomitang of being an "effulgence" of the green gang

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Gang
	The Green Gang was a major financial supporter of Chiang Kai-shek, who became acquainted with the gang when he lived in Shanghai from 1915 to 1923.[11] The Green Gang shared its profits from the drug trade with the Kuomintang after the creation of the Opium Suppression Bureau.[

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_Yuesheng
	In contrast to his views on legality, Du was politically a staunch Confucian conservative. He had close ties with Chiang Kai-shek, who in turn had ties to both the Green Gang and other organised secret societies from his early years in Shanghai.

Interesting that Green Gang supported Kai-shek, but apparently were also involved in the assassination of Song?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_Li
	The benign title of The Investigation and Statistics Bureau belied the true nature of its secret police work, making Dai one of the most powerful men in China, and earning him the nickname "the Himmler of China". Dai was also the head of the Blue Shirts Society, a fascist organization that did security and intelligence work for Chiang

oh a fascist organization that just pops out of nowhere to do intelligence work for you? where have I seen that before...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Shirts_Society
	In December 1931, under pressure both inside and outside the KMT, Chiang resigned. While in retirement at his hometown in Zhejiang, Chiang showed growing interest in Benito Mussolini's fascism. Deng subsequently let Chiang know of the existence of the SPTPP. Chiang summoned He, Teng and Kang to a meeting, where he announced his idea for a more formal and disciplined organization like those in Italy and Germany. Thus specific rules and articles to guide the party were drafted.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen
	Sun received help from the Comintern for his acceptance of communist members into his KMT. Revolutionary and socialist leader Vladimir Lenin praised Sun and the KMT for their ideology and principles. Lenin praised Sun and his attempts at social reformation, and also congratulated him for fighting foreign Imperialism.[74][75][76] Sun also returned the praise, calling him a "great man", and sent his congratulations on the revolution in Russia.[77]

	With the Soviets' help, Sun was able to develop the military power needed for the Northern Expedition against the military at the north. He established the Whampoa Military Academy near Guangzhou with Chiang Kai-shek as the commandant of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA).

I don't really get this... soviets openly playing both sides this time?

Anyway Green Gang "all but ran" the French Concession, but Okhrana was big in France, so a connection there?

Communist support for various factions in China


http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat2/sub5/item52.html
	Ignored by the Western powers and in charge of a southern military government with its capital in Guangzhou, Sun Yatsen eventually turned to the new Soviet Union for inspiration and assistance. The Soviets obliged Sun and his Kuomintang (Guomindang, Nationalist Party). Soviet advisers helped the Kuomintang establish political and military training activities. But Moscow also supported the new Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was founded by Mao Zedong (1893---1976) and others in Shanghai in 1921. The Soviets hoped for consolidation of the Kuomintang and the CCP but were prepared for either side to emerge victorious. The struggle for power in China began between the Kuomintang and the CCP as both parties also sought the unification of China. 

https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CHINA.CHAP1.HTM
	But these incompatible forces soon fell out. Subservient to Moscow, the communists sought to dominate the Kuomintang and prematurely organized revolution in the streets. Chiang Kai-shek, the acknowledged leader of the Kuomintang and Republican forces after Sun Yat-sen's death, turned on the communists in a bloody coup in 1927, massacring thousands of them.

	By E. Backhouse

	As regards Russia's position in the matter, he was of opinion that China had earned the contempt of the whole world by allowing herself to be so easily intimidated.
	..Russia had been weakened by her war with Turkey, and the life of her Sovereign was daily threatened by Nihilists. He was therefore of opinion that she could by no means fight a successful war against China.

http://www.pamelawernermurderpeking.com/backhouse.html
	the victim was Pamela Werner, the adopted daughter of a retired British consul resident in Peking. Backhouse sent his ‘solution’ to the consul, Mr Archer, through Dr Aspland, stating that he had learnt it through the Japanese for whom he was translating documents. This ‘solution’ brought him great credit. It was afterward cited by Hoeppli as evidence of Backhouse’s remarkable intelligence-network. But there is no reason to suppose that it had any foundation.


http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2012/07/the-infamous-sir-edmund-backhouse/
	And that wasn’t the only detail Roper got wrong, according to Sandhaus, calling into question Roper’s condemnation of Backhouse’s moral integrity. He writes of how Backhouse worked with a group of Manchus to rescue huge quantities of historical artifacts from the Summer Palace, before they were looted by foreign forces sent to quell the Boxer Rebellion. He was apprehended at the scene by Russian troops and arrested, but still managed to ensure that the artifacts were returned to the Forbidden City.

Are they going to do another flu attack and blame it on China?

Maybe this is why they try to spread conspiracy theories about vaccines--so they can kill more

I remember one of their propagandists after getting angry at me told me to "get sick and die." So possibly they are already preparing their own with propaganda to justify this


http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2017/03/whos-afraid-of-the-big-bad-flu/
	Dr. Chen’s laboratory is rated at the international biosafety level of three, out of a possible four. Biosafety levels are determined based on the kind of work done in any given biological lab, with Level Three being given to labs that deal with agents that cause serious illness and which transmit to hosts through inhalation. Despite the precautions required to be taken by all who work in a lab like this, the idea of a lethal and transmissible virus escaping from a lab causes great fear among scientists and citizens alike.

	Gain-of-function research has been criticized by the scientific community, as well as pundits, as being too risky and even unnecessary. In January 2012, prominent virologists who conduct gain-of-function research on the avian influenza strain H5N1 implemented a voluntary moratorium on their own research. The moratorium lasted nearly a year and was lifted in January 2013, despite concerns that this was not a long enough time for governments to consider how to ensure that no super-killer virus will escape from labs or fall into the hands of bioterrorists.

	Dr. Chen herself has come under fire, when The Independent published criticism of her work in May, 2013, by various scientists, including Robert McCredie May (Lord May of Oxford). Lord May, a professor of zoology at the University of Oxford, evaluated Dr. Chen’s work as irresponsible, dangerous, and motivated by “blind ambition.” 

	...In the meantime, a study has come out from the Harvard Department of Global Health and Population arguing that we are not at all prepared for the next deadly epidemic, based on the recent epidemics that were handled by various health organizations worldwide.


Why is this linked under "Joe Doran" but the name is "Malika Baratova"?


I wonder if they had anything to do with AIDS? They did have a lot of propaganda blaming it on the CIA. And there was a scare for awhile of homosexuals with AIDS which revived homophobia. Since they want to create homophobia this might have been one of their projects, would be worth looking at the journalists that contributed to that scare.

	Obviously unsatisfied with the myriad careers he had already held down, Backhouse went on to publish two major academic works: “China Under the Empress Dowager” and “Annals & Memoirs of the Court of Peking.” Both texts would vastly shape Western perceptions of China for generations to come.

wait, aren't they trying to paint China as some giant den of debauchery now?

So the guy writes a book about how he banged the Chinese Empress and spreads it all over the West to give them a low opinion of China, then writes some "reccomendations" to help keep China fighting in a war

I wonder if they spread rumors about "China is great for partying man you should go over there and act like an idiot!" so that the most annoying Westerners travel to China. This way they could get more "bang for their buck" in harming West-China relations by creating negative opinions of each other on both sides.


http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/cixi-the-woman-behind-the-throne-22312071/
	As a reporter for the Times of London, George Morrison's dispatches from Peking in the late 1890s and early 1900s were the only glimpse most Westerners got inside the Forbidden City. He wasn't a bad reporter, but he made the mistake of listening to a young man named Edmund Backhouse, an Oxford-trained linguist who contributed to many of Morrison's articles. As other sources—including Morrison's own diary—later revealed, much of Backhouse's "reporting" was utter fiction. But by the time Morrison realized this, it would have damaged his own reputation too much to reveal the truth.

	...The image of Cixi as a cruel and greedy tyrant gained historical traction in 1910, when Backhouse and another British journalist, J.O.P. Bland, published the book China Under the Empress Dowager. It was praised at the time for being a thoroughly researched biography, but as Seagrave notes, Backhouse forged many of the documents he cited.

	...It's hard to know what Backhouse's motivations may have been for this historical hoax, but perhaps sensational lies simply paved an easier path to fame than nuanced truth. Seagrave suggests that Backhouse had an unhappy childhood, suffered from mental illness and was "brilliant but highly unstable."

In 1974, it was revealed that the  earlier biograher  Sir Edmund Backhouse was responsible for the widespread vision of Tzu Hsi as a monster-was revealed to be a con man.  This is  the first true reappraisal of the  Empress  exposing  Backhouse's  writings about her as a major hoax & forgery, establishing  that  the most important Western correspondent in Peking during her reign-Dr.Morrison of  the  London times  kept a secret diary contradicting his own dispatches about Tzu Hsi

	Another well known but now widely questioned biography is “China Under The Empress Dowager” by J. O. P. Bland and Edmund Backhouse. Backhouse was later found to have forged some of his source materials when he wrote this work. This is a book that gave rise to much of the negative perspective of the dowager empress.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ying_Guixin
	He was a leader in the Shanghai Green Gang, Chief of Intelligence under the political leader Chen Qimei's provisional Shanghai Military Government, and later Commander of Sun Yat-sen's Presidential Guard. He was also closely associated with Yuan Shikai's government. Ying Guixin was directly involved in the assassination of Song Jiaoren who had been deemed a threat by various political factions loyal to Yuan Shikai.

So there's a connection. Helped assassinate Jiaoren, led Green Gang, and then was tight with Sun Yat-sen, who also got support from the soviets.

	While with the Green Gang he became acquainted with Yuan Shikai's second son Yuan Kewen with whom he shared an appreciation of antiques.

	After Chen Qimei's provisional government was overturned by Yuan Shikai, Ying Guixin switched loyalties. In 1913 Ying Guixin was contracted by Yuan Shikai's government to assassinate Song Jiaoren who had become a threat to not only Yuan Shikai but also a rival of both Sun Yat-Sen and Liang Qichao. He subcontracted this out to an ex-soldier named Wu Shiying who on March 20, 1913 approached Song Jiaoren at a Shanghai railway station and shot him with a Browning pistol; Song Jiaoren died two days later in the hospital.

	Due to the outcry, Ying Guixin and others who were believed to be involved were rounded up and arrested. Incriminating telegrams were found at his house and he was detained but managed to escape to Beijing in order to secure protection from Yuan Shikai. Indeed, all those suspected to be involved died mysteriously in order to deflect any responsibility from Yuan Shikai including the Premier of the Republic of China Zhao Bingjun, who was found poisoned. Ying Guixin was killed by two swordsmen in a first-class train compartment en route to Tianjin.

But why is this written so strangely?

China's wikipedia seems more insistent that Green Gang assassinated Song?

I wonder if Okhrana wanted to assoicate the assassination on Chaing Kai-Shek (or Taiwan basically).

http://archive.is/Eg56J

Right so they say it was probably Yaun

But assassinating him and blaming Yaun would be a clear way to divide China


http://www.historytoday.com/jonathan-fenby/chinese-democracy-silencing-song
	A western woman doctor said he could have been saved if she had been able to act immediately. 

Something off about this article too

	The Yuan administration tried to blame the assassination on internal Kuomintang feuds, conjuring up an unknown organisation called the Women’s Assassination Group. But Ying was an immediate suspect and was arrested as he was smoking opium in a brothel. Police found the exchange of telegrams with Peking in his house, together with the murder weapon. There was also an incriminating letter from the prime minister, who soon stepped down on the grounds that he was suffering from toothache; he died of poisoning the next year. Wu was arrested and also died of poisoning while awaiting trial. Ying escaped to Peking but was stabbed to death soon afterwards in a railway compartment.

	...Chinese society remained rooted in its traditions; modern ideas about politics did spread among the intellectual elite but had a limited influence.

Same subtle racism as the Epstein article

	So, on current showing, Xi does not seem to be the leader who will be ready, or able, to undertake the structural reforms China needs in the coming years. He will have to deal with a society that is evolving beyond the constraints of the party state system – and with new tensions, as demonstrated by the ongoing imbroglio around the rock star of Chinese politics, Bo Xilai, in the mega-municipality of Chongqing. China has enormous problems, ranging from the environment to the legal system, through corruption and a lack of trust in authority of all kinds.

how does that follow? kinda suspicious


http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/what-west-should-know-about-xi-jinping-china-s-most-powerful-leader-mao
	In targeting high-profile “tigers” such as the maverick Politburo member Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2013, and the former security chief Zhou Yongkang, who was given a life sentence on 11 June, Xi has shown that nobody is safe though powerful vested interests are bound to oppose him. (Besides being found guilty of corruption, Zhou was accused of divulging secret documents to his spiritual guru, who claims supernatural powers. A brief video of his sentencing showed a man who was once one of the PRC’s most powerful figures, his previously black hair turned white, evidently from having hair dye denied to him in detention.) Close associates of Hu Jintao and his immediate predecessor, Jiang Zemin, have been detained; the campaign has also swatted tens of thousands of less eminent “flies” and induced a widespread atmosphere of fear.

Same thing in other propaganda, saying the "anti-corruption campaign" was a brutal communist crackdown or something.

What exactly was going on with the "crackdown?" Guessing it might have been a crackdown on Okhrana types, then they got mad and are now trying to steer them into a war with the U.S. instead?

Did their attitude toward Xi change after the crackdown? well ok it basically started as soon as he took office

If Mao was a useful idiot for Stalin, Stalin could have tried to arrange the Korean war between the U.S. and China? and they would be going for a repeat today

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Russia

State-sanctioned/promoted racism? This could motivate some of their spies I guess. Like if Okhrana wants them to be agents used against the rest of the world.

Looks like they had also used anti-semitism? like they could do similar to the Nazis and use "outing" someone as a jew to blackmail them, just like they do with outing someone as a homosexual. So basically the more hateful their population is the more they can control it, and you can see that in racism and state-promoted homophobia as well.

http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2014/05/29/book-review-will-china-dominate-the-21st-century-by-jonathan-fenby/
	The book neatly summarizes China’s recent history, propagating the theory that China could outpace the USA to become the world’s foremost power if it continues to follow the trajectory of the last 30 years, before going to demolish that same theory as it discusses the domestic and international challenges that will prevent it from becoming a true superpower.

Are they trying to convince the U.S. to use the same "divide and conquer" tactics on China that Russia uses? Like it would be a cover for them?

Maybe that's something they tried before...

So let me get this straight: he's claiming Ying hapened to keep all the incrimineting telegrams in his house (why would he send telegrams about this, nevermind keep them in his house?) along with an incriminating letter from the Prime Minister. And they all mysteriously died later after providing all this evidence that happens to incriminate Yaun...

Also interesting that Sun Yat-sen joined in on shitting on Yaun after Song's death.

Who is this J.F. Goodnow guy? Is he the same guy who raised that it might have been Yaun who did it?

http://prabook.com/web/person-view.html?profileId=1059514

Well he was a diplomat living in shanghai...

Why is Fenby so eager to point out Goodnow?

So is Fenby one of them?

Get the sense they seem to revel in this, like they're proud of their work or their history. A general theme with them seems to be that they enjoy manipulating people.

Now if Fenby were one of them, and knew the Okhrana assassinated Song, that would be some pretty sensitive intel, like something that could drastically change public opinion if proved.

So if true, how did he learn it? who does he report to?

People like Fenby, Epstein, Marks seem to be something else entirely. Not like most other Russian propagandists.

So he wins all sorts of awards but it's easy to point out flaws in his work...

Just like Kissinger won a nobel peace prize, huh?

I wonder of the Okhrana just never gave up their international contacts and just kept building them up?

I can see you :)

	The tumultuous events of 1913 have since become Exhibit A for the historians who argue that electoral democracy is somehow incompatible with the Chinese experience. 

?

	All evidence pointed to a conspiracy orchestrated by Yuan Shikai (pictured), a powerful and ambitious general-turned-politician who was then president of the fledgling Chinese republic. Coincidentally, this week marks an important milestone in Yuan’s career as well. On March 26th 1916, three years (almost to the day) after Song succumbed to his wounds, Yuan was forced to admit defeat for his own plan—which had been to subvert the republic and declare himself the emperor of a new dynasty.

Again saying it was obviously Yaun when it mostly sounds like he was framed

	Song Jiaoren (Sung Chiao-jen), the President of the Kuomingtang Party in the Republic of China, was shot and fatally wounded while waiting for a train in Shanghai; Song would die two days later. Song’s killer, Wu Shiying, had been assisted by Ying Guixing, and a search of their apartments found documents linking the murder to cabinet Minister Hong Shuzu, Interior Minister Zhao Bingjun, and even President Yuan Shikai.

So there just happens to be all this evidence documenting the involvement of two senior officials and the president...

This guy is suspicious


https://www.cnas.org/publications/blog/5-questions-with-someone-interesting-charles-emmerson
	I think it’s interesting to note the extraordinary disparity between the number of ice breakers that for example Russia has and the U.S. You might say it doesn’t matter very much. The Russian Arctic is much, much bigger than the U.S. Arctic, after all. But there’s a question of intent, as well as a question of capacity here. The Canadians have been talking about upgrading their presence in the Arctic – including with icebreakers – though it’s now unclear how that is really going to happen.

Where have I heard this "icebreakers" thing before?

What do they want more shipping in the arctic? not sure what's going on there.

	Well first of all, there’s certainly an increasing convergence in terms of the idea that climate change is the reality, and that a large part of it is anthropogenic, although there are still a number of Russian scientists – including at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St. Petersburg – who argue that the anthropogenic contribution is generally overstated in the West. The argument put to me there was that what we’re now seeing in the Arctic – and there’s no denying that Arctic warming is real – is a blip, and it may actually be overshadowed by a natural cooling effect over time. This argument was put to me in Russia, but it’s not current elsewhere around the Arctic. So there’s still some divergence in scientists’ views, but not very much and it’s becoming smaller.

	But in terms of effects, it really depends on who you talk to. Not so much in terms of whether there are impacts, now, of some warming in the Arctic, but in terms of whether these are a good or a bad thing. 

	...

	There’s another point worth making here. One reason perhaps why the Russians sort of didn’t seem to mind very much about climate change for a long time is because they had this idea that Russia would be a net gainer from climate change, simply by virtue of, Russia’s tremendous northern territories.

???


They also might see Climate change as a way to kill more people or create more unrest since it would cause a lot of migration from the countries affected. So they could use it to try to "collapse more empires" or something

http://ams.hi.is/en/2010/09/29/28th-september-the-future-history-of-the-arctic-gold-rush-or-a-new-cold-war/

Maybe they want to spread the idea of a "gold rush" for the arctic so people think global warming is a good thing? like "with global warming we will have more shipping routes and can drill for more oil"

	Again, what distinguished this system from prewar ones was not only its structured networks for control, transit, and communications, but also its worldwide extension. Soviet centers were in Berlin and Vienna, but they operated as well in central Asia and Shanghai.[
	...he result was the centers, underground circuits, false passport workshops, courier networks, and covers that turned up in police and counterintelligence reports in the twenties and thirties. Moreover, the global expanse of Soviet operations was powered not only by ambitions for world revolution or the perception that the easiest pickings were to be found in the empires, but also by the fear of a capitalist counterrevolutionary onslaught on all geographical fronts and by the dispersion of considerable numbers of White Russian refugees to East Asia, especially Manchuria.

side from the security difficulty attendant upon appointing apparently over-qualified men to fairly low consular posts, the 'secret' military agents often had an acrimonious relationship with their official 'public' counterparts. The 'secret' military agent appointed in 1896 to China for instance, Colonel Desino, lacked even desultory diplomatic cover due to his aide being an active army officer, and had a poor relationship with the official military agent there, Colonel K. I. Vogak. The situation was only finally resolved by Desino's promotion to being the second 'public' military agent to Shanghai in 1899. At the same time, when discussing these military agents, it is necessary to remember that officers so assigned received no special training in covert intelligence work, such a course only being established at the Staff Academy after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. 

Okhrana in Shanghai, and on the relationship between the "public" and "secret" agents.

	One contemporary recalled that until then at the Academy secret intelligence had been regarded as a rather 'dirty' occupation, the province of undercover policemen and other 'shady characters.' 

...

At the end of 1909 the Main Directorate of the General Staff concurred with this suggestion, and in 1911 laid upon the shoulders of the assistant military agent in Shanghai, Ll-Colonel Nikolaev, the task of organizing an agent network-No. 31-which conducted intelligence in Japan. This network remained in existence at considerable expense (35, 000 roubles annually) until 1914, when the General Staff finally transferred the greater burden of its intelligence-pthering activities to the European frontier.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Jingwei
	Wang Jingwei (Wang Ching-wei; 4 May 1883 – 10 November 1944); born as Wang Zhaoming (Wang Chao-ming), but widely known by his pen name "Jingwei", was a Chinese politician. He was initially a member of the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT), but later became increasingly anti-communist after his efforts to collaborate with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ended in political failure. His political orientation veered sharply to the right later in his career after he joined the Japanese.

	Wang was a close associate of Sun Yat-sen for the last twenty years of Sun's life. After Sun's death Wang engaged in a political struggle with Chiang Kai-shek for control over the Kuomintang, but lost. Wang remained inside the Kuomintang, but continued to have disagreements with Chiang until the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, after which he accepted an invitation from the Japanese Empire to form a Japanese-supported collaborationist government in Nanjing. Wang served as the head of state for this Japanese puppet government until he died, shortly before the end of World War II. Although he is still regarded as an important contributor in the Xinhai Revolution, his collaboration with the Imperial Japanese is a subject of academic debate,

Academic debate you say?

	Wang had clearly lost control of the KMT by 1926, when, following the Zhongshan Warship Incident, Chiang successfully sent Wang and his family to vacation in Europe. It was important for Chiang to have Wang away from Guangdong while Chiang was in the process of expelling communists from the KMT because Wang was then the leader of the left wing of the KMT, notably sympathetic to communists and communism, and may have opposed Chiang if he had remained in China

Well that's fucking suspicious


What was up with Chaing's purge of communists? it seems like the same deal with Rosenberg putting out rabid anti-communist propaganda and slaughtering everyone

	Chiang was a much more of a hard-line anti-Communist than was Wang, but Chiang was also a self-proclaimed "realist" who was willing if necessary to have an alliance with the Soviet Union.

"realist" where have I heard that before?

	Wang accompanied the government on its retreat to Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). During this time, he organized some right-wing groups under European fascist lines inside the KMT. Wang was originally part of the pro-war group; but, after the Japanese were successful in occupying large areas of coastal China, Wang became known for his pessimistic view on China's chances in the war against Japan.[17] He often voiced defeatist opinions in KMT staff meetings, and continued to express his view that Western imperialism was the greater danger to China, much to the chagrin of his associates. Wang believed that China needed to reach a negotiated settlement with Japan so that Asia could resist Western Powers.

so first he's a communist, then he's a nazi, then he tries to surrender to Japan?

	For his role in the Pacific War, Wang has been considered a traitor by most post-World War II Chinese historians in both Taiwan and mainland China. His name has become a byword for "traitor" or "treason" in mainland China and Taiwan, similarly to "Quisling" in Europe or "Benedict Arnold" in the United States. The mainland's communist government despised Wang not only for his collaboration with the Japanese, but also for his anti-communism, while the KMT downplayed his anti-communism and emphasised his collaboration and betrayal of Chiang Kai-shek. The communists also used his ties with the KMT to demonstrate what they saw as the duplicitous, treasonous nature of the KMT. Both sides downplayed his earlier association with Sun Yat-sen because of his eventual collaboration

Now what would happen if it turned out he was working for the Okhrana the whole time...

Ex-Minister Assaulted by Suffragette: We regret very 
much to record here that the tendency of the woman suf- 
frage movement at home is following the British fashion — 
from bad to worse. It was reported that amidst one of the 
most imposing welcomes tendered to Dr. Sun Yat-Sen during 
his visit to Pekin, a scene was created by a Chinese Pank- 
hurst, Miss Tong Ching-Ying. Seizing the advantage of the 
picture taking, which has grown to be a favorite part on pro- 
grams of the recent important semi-political gatherings, the 
militant suffragette stole an approach behind Mr. Sung Chiao- 
Jen, ex-Minister of the Board of Agriculture and Forestry. 
All at once Sung's hair was forcibly and maliciously laid hold 
upon, and a beating on his face followed. The assembly was 
amazed. Effort was immediately made to separate the as- 
sailant and the assailed. It did not take long to discover that 
the members of the woman suffrage society in Pekin have long 
held their victim in mind, owing to the fact that the ex- 
Minister was believed to have taken an active part in the 
striking out of certain principles relating to 'equal rights of 
men and women," maintained by the former Federal League 
(Tung Min Hui), of which Sung was one of the leaders. It 
was reported that in consideration of the amalgamation of the 
several Ultra-radical parties with the Tung Min Hui. Sung 
did advocate the abandonment of the said principle in favor of 
woman suffrage, because the Ultra-radical parties were strictly 
opposed to that principle. Since Sung's misfortune, prepara- 
tions are being made at every important meeting for the 
timely ousting of riotous suffragettes, whenever occasion de- 
mands it. 

Didn't Yuan blame the "women's assassination league" or something?


https://archive.org/stream/chinesestudentsm08unse/chinesestudentsm08unse_djvu.txt

IN April we heard of the assassination of Sung Chiao Jen, 
an ardent supporter of Dr. Sun Yat Sen and also a mem- 
ber of President Yuan's first cabinet. This tragedy took 
place in Shanghai, just as he was planning to go to Pekin 
as one of the leaders of the progressive Ko Ming Tang. 

In May General Hsu Pao San, otherwise known as "Tiger" 
Hsu, a vigorous supporter of Yuan Shih, was blown to 
pieces by a bomb as he opened a box which he thought con- 
tained rare porcelains of which he was an enthusiastic con- 
noisseur. Both of these crimes have created clouds of 
suspicion between North and South. The quick succession 
of these murders suggested to some "An eye for an eye and 
a tooth for a tooth." Such deeds characterize the ancient 
Hebrews and other primitive peoples. 

??

China is now a republic and if she is to remain such, such 
acts must cease. The differences between the parties in China 
must not be. settled by bullets and bombs but by reason and 
the ballot. Public men should not be required to hazard their 
lives as the price of their political convictions.

	An anonymous reply refuting Sung's criticism and attacking his personal conduct, as well as his Nationalist Party, appeared in various newspapers. He was again accused of coveting the premiership, and China's existing difficulties with foreign powers were held as the legacies of the first cabinet. This provoked a sharp reply from Sung Chiao-jen, but, more importantly, he revelaed that the author of this anonymous article had access to most confidential information, and therefore must be a member of the government's inner circle. In fact he hinted that if the article was not the work of the President or the Premier, then it was at least written with their connivance. This represented the first head-on clash between Sung Chiao-jen and the President, and its intensity, as revealed by the unreserved use of abusive language in the government-inspired refutation, signalled the governing clique's more ruthless measures to come.

Not so fast Sung, could have been a spy...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism_in_China
	Once the Bolsheviks in Russia had consolidated their power, they immediately sought to expand their sphere of influence. Their interpretation of Karl Marx’s prediction that the revolution would be global was that – as the vanguard – it was their role to use the resources at their disposal to instigate and support Bolshevik-style revolutions all over the world. In keeping with Vladimir Lenin’s doctrine on imperialism, their focus was on the undeveloped nations, because they believed that once those nations had thrown off imperialism, Western capitalism – deprived of the material support and raw materials it required – would collapse. They also specifically targeted countries with already established revolutionary movements, and China clearly qualified.

	In 1919 the anarchists played a significant role in the May 4th Movement which swept the country. It was at this time that the first Bolsheviks started organising in China and began contacting anarchist groups for aid and support. The anarchists, mistaking the Bolsheviks for allies & unaware of how the Bolsheviks had subordinated the Soviets to their party apparatus, helped them set up communist study groups – many of which were originally majority anarchist – and introduced the Bolsheviks into the Chinese labor and student movements.

	After World War 1, many progressive Chinese intellectuals lost faith in the democracy of a Western-style Republic and turned to socialism. Anarchism then became the most popular and pervasive of all forms of socialism in China. Therefore many radical individuals and organisations were affected by anarchism to a greater or lesser extent. At first when the Bolshevik agents came to China they could not find Marxists or Communists in China. The most radical revolutionaries they could find were anarchists or persons influenced by anarchism and hence the latter naturally became the target and allies of the Bolsheviks. The Chinese anarchist who became the first to co-operate with the Russian Bolsheviks was perhaps Zhang Mochi. Zhang Mochi (alias Zhang Minquan and Sheng Guocheng), was an editor of Minsheng's Esperanto edition from 1914 .1 24 Before 1917, Zhang was sent abroad as a representative of the Chinese anarchists to attend some anarchist conferences in Europe. He happened to be in Moscow at the time of the October Revolution. Soon he began to work on behalf of Soviet Russia and returned to China in late spring or early summer of 1918 when the student movement against the Sino-Japanese Joint Military Defence Pact reached its climax. About 3,000 students who had been studying in Japan returned to China in protest at the military pact and a number of them organised the Returned Students' National Salvation League. Zhang joined the League in Shanghai and became the leader of a sub-organisation, the Slide-Show and Lecture Team


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dallin
	However, New Left academics had come to dismiss Dallin’s works by the mid-1960s due to his citations of testimony from defectors and exiles plus congressional and FBI investigations, all seen as anti-communist. "Such evidence was increasingly distrusted, and Dallin’s Menshevik past was taken as reason for skepticism as well," Haynes has noted.

Something suspicious about Yuan Shikai's death?

lots of rumors swirling about it anyway

a "surgeon of the French Legation" was at his side and his "certificate" quieted rumors of suicide

https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14345/14345-h/14345-h.htm
	Early on the 6th June an electric thrill ran through Peking—Yuan Shih-kai was dead! At first the news was not believed, but by eleven o'clock it was definitely known in the Legation Quarter that he had died a few minutes after ten o'clock that morning from uraemia of the blood—the surgeon of the French Legation being in attendance almost to the last. A certificate issued later by this gentleman immediately quieted the rumours of suicide, though many still refused to believe that he was actually dead. "I did not wish this end," he is reported to have whispered hoarsely a few minutes before he expired, "I did not wish to be Emperor. Those around me said that the people wanted a king and named me for the Throne. I believed and was misled." And in this way did his light flicker out.

	Manchu and Muscovite

	By. L. Putnam Weale

	The book to be read by those who wish to understand the true position of Russia in Manchuria at the moment of the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war. . .Writing with an authority that cannot be doubted, and supporting his conclusions by an exhaustive array of carefully investigated facts, Mr. Weale formulates one long indictment of the Russian in Manchuria.

	...Readers should understand that Mr. Weale's very timely and instructive book was written before the outbreak of war between Russian and Japan, although several of his forecasts, e.g., the taking of the Dalny, have already been fulfilled.


https://books.google.com/books?id=Lc5AAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=%22Putnam+Weale%22+OR+%22Bertram+Lenox+Simpson%22+Russia&source=bl&ots=qG_JrclwNx&sig=-VKRgRuNeDdAlZy_MXW3PKunVSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi016OFx77TAhVE4SYKHaqNBQUQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=%22Putnam%20Weale%22%20OR%20%22Bertram%20Lenox%20Simpson%22%20Russia&f=false
	Mr. Weale writes: "Russia, although she lost something by the great war, has gained in compactness." Against Mr. Putnam Weale's elaborate proof that Russia in some degree looks forward to an eventual renewal of war...

And he got mysteriously assassinated...


http://www.cshagen.com/tag/bertram-lenox-simpson/
	The Manchu Dynasty fell on his watch, and he became an advisor to Chinese presidents and warlords, who one by one stripped away his dreams of a united China.  With apocryphal clarity he foresaw the upcoming Japanese invasion and warned the world, producing nearly one book every year

	...All his adult life Simpson strove for change.  He didn’t stop until the day three assassins entered his home on Woodrow Wilson Road in the former German Concession, now Jiefang South Road, and shot him in the back.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game
	"The Great Game" is a term used by historians to describe a political and diplomatic confrontation that existed for most of the nineteenth century between Britain and Russia over Afghanistan and neighbouring territories in Central and Southern Asia. Russia was fearful of British commercial and military inroads into Central Asia, and Britain was fearful of Russia adding "the jewel in the crown", India, to the vast empire that Russia was building in Asia. This resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires.


So if Yuan was assassinated, would the Brits know? or at least suspect?

https://books.google.com/books?id=Lc5AAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=%22Putnam+Weale%22+OR+%22Bertram+Lenox+Simpson%22+Russia&source=bl&ots=qG_JrclwNx&sig=-VKRgRuNeDdAlZy_MXW3PKunVSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi016OFx77TAhVE4SYKHaqNBQUQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=%22Putnam%20Weale%22%20OR%20%22Bertram%20Lenox%20Simpson%22%20Russia&f=false

And here's an article shitting on Simpson.

This has been going on for centuries, hasn't it?

But something changed with the Bolsheviks.

So it's like Russia and Britain had a long spy war, then the Okhrana was formed near the end, then they got taken over by crooks and took over Russia.

So they would have grown out of conflict, opposition to the west, and association with criminals

Did they help collapse the British empire? like what were they doing in India?

Looks like they ended Chinese empire, maybe the British empire, others

This could explain why they think so highly of themselves, or think of themselves as the scourge of empires. War, famine, pestilence, and death, but death was interpreted as death of an empire. Also explains why they like to call America an "empire."

Now it seems like they aren't as strong. Like they tried to keep a stranglehold in China but it looks like they might have shook some of them off. Might explain why they want a war between China and the U.S. so badly (to destroy both). But their efforts there don't seem to have been working so well. And clearly there are problems internal to Russia with all the assassinations going on.

Might be why they seem so "bold," like it's a last-ditch power-grab, openly threatening "digital bombs" and "global pandemics" and assassinating or blackmailing world leaders and such. But they would know that this would expose them, so it might have been a "do or die" thing for them.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/1405322?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents
	Through the secret "circles" organized in Mongolia, primarily against the Chinese, the spirit of revolution prepared a favorable background and social justice. The Russians, however, were looked upon as a foreign invading power, but they were not felt so visibly as the Chinese were. Besides, the Russian Revolution apparently stood on the principle of equality among the proletarians of all the nations. The revolutionary Russians extended supposedly friendly hands to the unorganized Mongols, hands which were not trusted but still appeared better than the Chinese.

so Russia was doing similar things in Mongolia

One of the Tutuhs claims Yuan also "connived" with Russia for the Mongolia deal


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_Era
	Duan toppled the monarchist regime and was hailed as the savior of the republic, giving him greater clout. He was able to declare war against Germany. His next task was to subdue the south, but differences with the Zhili clique, which preferred negotiating a treaty, led to his resignation to save the unity of the Beiyang. President Feng Guozhang, however, had to recall Duan due to pressure from the Anhui clique. The campaign in Hunan backfired, resulting in attrition, low morale and bitterness. Duan resigned again in October 1918 but made every effort to sabotage peace between north and south. His pro-Japanese policies weakened him during the May Fourth Movement. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Mongolia
	For China, the occupation indirectly led to the permanent breakup of the Beiyang Army and the fall of strongman Duan Qirui. This marked the period of high warlordism as the former officers of Yuan Shikai battled each other for many years to come. Many White Russian guerrillas became mercenaries in China after the occupation.

What was this Duan Qirui guy up to?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai#Revival_of_monarchy
	In late 1915, rumors were floated of a popular consensus that the monarchy should be revived. With his power secure, many of Yuan's supporters, notably monarchist Yang Du, advocated for a revival of the monarchy, asking Yuan to take on the title of Emperor. Yang reasoned that the Chinese masses had long been used to autocratic rule, the Republic had only been effective as a transitional phase to end Manchu rule, and China's political situation demanded the stability that only a monarchy could ensure. The American political scientist Frank Johnson Goodnow suggested a similar idea. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Du
Yang Du eventually joined communist party

Yang Du help divide Mongolia and China?

Yang Du had a "gold and iron doctrine" that was imperialist and maybe racist?


https://books.google.com/books?id=GolZDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA163A
	Zhang cited Yang Du: "The purpose of the name 'central state' is to demarcate outer regions from central regions. The purpose of the name "central Hua" is to distinguish between the Hua [Chinese] high culture and the Yi [barbarian] low culture"

	...Zhang's strategy to incorporate non-Chinese regions into a Chinese nation-state was through assimilation and thus was close to Liang's ideas of "greater nationalism."

	...Before Zhang gave his own reasons for including the "three wild domains," he criticised Yang Du's reasons. Zhang quoted:

		Russia is the leader among our opponents. Russia certainly wishes every day to snatch Mongolia and the Turkic Muslim areas to put them in her sack. Now, when Russia sees that there is division among China's ethnicities, and that the Mongols' and Turkic Muslim's level is not enough to build a state on their own, how could they not want to invade and occupy the Mongol and Turkic Muslim regions? And as soon as Russia has occupied the Mongol and Turkic Muslims regions, Britain will inevitably invade Tibet, and France will inevitably invade Yunnan and Guangdong. So, if the territory of the Han Chinese people is not protected, then the cause of domestic division will lead to the effect of foreign division.


This guy knew what was up. Interesting that they might have known what was going on but still lost

wait was this Zhang or Yang saying this? confusing wording

Sounds like Yang wanted to dominate the "outer regions" and Zhang wanted to assimilate them

Was Zhang an advisor to Yuan?

Sounds like Zhang was racist too

Ok looks like Yuan knew what Russia was doing or how they thought (divide and conquer) but had different reasons? like he wanted "buffer states" or something (sounds like north korea now?)


So basically sounds like Yang Du wanted imperialism and buffer states immediately to counter the Russian threat, while Zhang wanted to join some states by diplomacy (safer from imperialists if joined up) and assimilation.

Yang Du kindof sounds like Russian influence agents today? "we need to make Mongolia a vassal buffer state to counter the Russian threat!" "we need to build icebreakers and fuck up the north pole to counter the Russian threat!"

But if Yang Du's ideas stuck it would have helped Russia do their revolution in Mongolia, which apparently resented Chinese influence which Russia exploited. So, turning a stronger force against itself.


So I think I see what Yang Du was saying: he says Russia would exploit racial divisions (which is true), but concluded that the solution was to keep China of Han Chinese as a separate nation from other territories, and keep the others and buffer states. Zhang wanted to integrate them into the Chinese state.

If Yang Du's ideas influenced Chinese leadership, then it could have contributed to Russia's influence operations in Mongolia.

I wonder if fomenting arguments about their intentions or strategy has been a tactic for them? They would realize that other states would see their influence operations targeting the public and be able to figure out their strategy from that. So to counter that the logical step is to confuse governments themselves about their strategy. Influence agents within the target governments and "fake intelligence" could contribute to that.


Ok here is sounds like he's saying something different:

https://books.google.com/books?id=iB0oCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=Yang+Du+%22three+wild+domains%22&source=bl&ots=rJMFFGD2jZ&sig=9ATQ9iq_tlu2Fk2kKefMVeTnV-s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjiisjh2cPTAhVIOyYKHVmaBZQQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&q=Yang%20Du%20%22three%20wild%20domains%22&f=false

	The idea for the five races to stand separately is one for state demise and must not be carried out.

Ok he's saying there can't be just a Han revolution because China needs to keep its territories, and Government needs to change slowly.

So it sounds like he was saying the same thing that Zhang was saying, that China should be one state with all those ethnicities and such. So what was the argument with Zhang about exactly? The reasons for having them in the Chinese state? Yang Du clearly saw it as a national security issue.
	
	According to Yang Du's reasoning, the revolution was completely liable. Since culturally the Mongols, Tibetans, and the Hui could not become compatible with the Han right away and neither did the Han have the ability at the moment to establish military control of these peoples and territories ... the frontier peoples "will take advantage of the opportunity to turn themselves loose and split."

Seemed to be counter-revolutionary. And he was involved with all these too which is weird.

I wonder if Okhrana was trying to screw up the revolution? The explosion forced them to revolt earlier than they planned and maybe gave the Qing and earlier advantage. And I guess Yang Du was here to argue against the revolution and keep saying that keeping the "frontier people's" incorporated was more important.

	Yang Du advertised his "preparatory society" on Aug 23rd, 1915. The "Latter Six Gentlemen" included Yang Du, Sun Yujun, Yan Fu, Liu Shipei, Li Xiehe and Hu Ying. Quite some of the organizers were previously members of the "Tong Meng Hui" alliance. The "Theories of Constitutional Monarchy for Salvation of Nation" was published on Aug 26th. Yuan Shikai, who was constantly nervous about enthronement, was pleased to know that Yan Fu [i.e., the 1st schoolmaster of Peking U] had joined the "preparatory society". Yang Du's "preparatory society" launched a nationwide enrolment movement by mailing out the application forms, gallop forms and Goodnow's article to leaders of all provinces as well as in the capital. In the capital, other than top leaders [like Li Yuanhong, Duan Qirui, Xu Shichang & Zhang Jian], majority folks expressed support. Provincial leaders, other than Feng Guozhang & Zhang Xu, the rest of governor-generals had expressed support as well, including the non-northern lineage people like Tang Jiyao & Yan Xishan. By Sept 2nd, 19 generals made a joint petition. Yang Du's "preparatory society" then changed its civilian status by proposing the establishment of a "citizen petition corps". Some senators, who advocated a "national petition united society" for taking control of the petition movement, then proposed to organize a "national assembly" on the pretext that the "citizen petition corps" had submitted tons of petitions. Tang Degang stated that the "6 gentlemen" had expanded into "13 gestapos" with the addition of opportunist senators. On Sept 6th, Yuan Shikai, having known that the Senate had agreed to make him an emperor, ordered that Yang Shiqi read aloud his declination which had a reservation as to acceptance should the whole nation wish to see so. Liang Shiyi compromised the Senate proposition by transforming Yang Du's "preparatory society" into the government-funded "constitutional monarch advancement society" in mid-Oct. The "national assembly" then turned into a "national representative assembly" whereby provinces sent in their reps for a vote on changing the government structure as well as the republican system. 1993 representatives voted for a change in early Dec of 1915. On Dec 11th, Whang Daxie, shouting three "long live 10,000 years", submitted the letter of petition to have Yuan Shikai become an emperor. (Tang Degang pointed out that Yang Du's imperial proposition to Yuan Shikai had its social background, i.e., the Chinese popular resentment over the social instability in early Republic Era. Tang cited Li Zongren's claim that the Chinese mentality in the Republic era was much worse than that in the late Manchu era, at which time all Chinese were in high spirits for the sole purpose of making China strong and prosperous. Tang also cited Jiang Fucong of Taiwan's Central Library in pointing out that Taiwan in the late 20th century was even worse than the KMT era of the early 20th century: Jiang Fucong stated that he could not understand the widely-reported incest matter in the Taiwan media since in the late Manchu era, a county magistrate was ordered to be deprived of his duty when some man under the jurisdiction hit a birth-mother. Using this line of thought, we could say that Communist China was even worse than the KMT of Taiwan: e.g., HK truck drivers had been able to set up the "second wives villages" at the HK-Shenzhen border, and 82-year-old scientist Yang Zhenning had just married with a 28-year-old young woman.)

	When 2,000 years of Chinese empire ended it was with a bang – and with a whimper. The bang took place in October 1911 in the Russian quarter of Hankou, where the casual disposal of a cigarette in a Chinese revolutionary bomb factory caused an accidental explosion, bringing the Qing authorities running, and forcing local army units – who had been heavily infiltrated by revolutionaries – to accelerate a planned rebellion.



https://www.britannica.com/biography/Song-Jiaoren
	Song Jiaoren, Wade-Giles romanization Sung Chiao-jen (born April 5, 1882, Taoyuan, Hunan province, China—died March 22, 1913, Shanghai), founder of the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang), whose assassination blighted hopes for democratic government in China in the early 20th century.


https://books.google.com/books?id=Kc4iBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA405
	His prognosis was that tradition and authority – ‘throne and court’ – would reassert themselves in some shape or form, and indeed that this would be best for China’s future development. The events of the year seemed to support the case. On 20 March 1913 Song Jiaoren, leader of the Kuomintang party and premier-elect, was shot twice in Shanghai railway station as he boarded a train bound for Peking, where he was to attend the opening of the new National Assembly. Though taken to hospital, he died from his wounds two days later. Song Jiaoren’s murderer was swiftly arrested. But most suspected that the order for the assassination came from much higher up: perhaps even from President Yuan Shikai himself. ‘It is not impossible that some over-zealous follower of Yuan may have thought he was aiding the President’s cause by planning such a crime’, an American diplomat in Shanghai noted, hedging his bets. For KMT supporters the crime confirmed their suspicions – frequently voiced by Song Jiaoren during and since the 1912 campaign – that what the President really wanted was to dispense with parliament altogether and rule as Emperor in all but name. A little over a year after Sun Yat-Sen had stood aside for Yuan Shikai in the national interest – and in recognition of his own military weakness – the two were at each other’s throats. In Shanghai, republicans threatened that Song Jiaoren’s death would be ‘avenged by a reign of terror more frightful than that of the French revolution’. The city became a ‘storm centre’ of ‘secret plottings’.

	No wonder that the opening of the National Assembly in Peking in early April 1913, was a dull affair. ‘The sun shone, bands played, complimentary addresses were delivered’, the North China Daily News reported. But, on the whole, it was an ‘anti-climax’. Yuan Shikai was not there, pleading his own assassination fears. A large number of elected representatives failed to appear, too. And amongst those who did, instead of the ‘mass of brilliant colors which always characterized a Chinese crowd in the old days’, the choice of clothing was sober, formal and Western: black frock coats and silk hats. As the event got under way, a circular was handed round to members of the new National Assembly advising them that, with several hundred foreigners anticipated to be coming along to watch, it was imperative to ‘maintain a dignified and graceful demeanour … so that we may command the respect and win the friendship of foreigners’. The whole thing seemed more about saving face than about saving China.




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Mongolia
	For China, the occupation indirectly led to the permanent breakup of the Beiyang Army and the fall of strongman Duan Qirui. This marked the period of high warlordism as the former officers of Yuan Shikai battled each other for many years to come. Many White Russian guerrillas became mercenaries in China after the occupation.

China’s Communist Party, which came to power in 1949, claims most of the credit for that victory over Japan and therefore the right to rule. But most of Chinese killed during the war were nationalist troops of leader Chiang Kai-shek, instead of the Communist forces of Mao Zedong.

Guessing Okhrana directed Japan, Mao, and Kai-Shek to make this happen?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria
	The Japanese invasion of Manchuria began on September 18, 1931, when the Kwantung Army of the Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria immediately following the Mukden Incident. The Japanese established a puppet state called Manchukuo, and their occupation lasted until the end of World War II.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi'an_Incident
	The Xi'an Incident of December 1936 (traditional Chinese: 西安事變; simplified Chinese: 西安事变; pinyin: Xī'ān Shìbìan),[1] an important turning point in Chinese modern history, took place in the city of Xi'an during the Chinese Civil War between the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the insurgent Chinese Communist Party and just before the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 12 December 1936, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang, was arrested by Marshal Zhang Xueliang, a former warlord of Manchuria and Commander of the North Eastern Army who had fought against the Japanese occupation of Manchuria and subsequent expansion into Inner Mongolia by the Japanese and troops of the puppet state of Manchukuo that had been created in Manchuria.

	The incident led to a truce between the Nationalists and the Communists in order to form a united front against the threat posed by Japan. Some facts about the incident still remain unclear today, as most of those involved died without revealing details. 


	...He Yingqin, a pro-Japanese senior general in the Kuomintang, was preparing to lead military forces to Xi'an from the KMT capital, Nanjing at the time of the incident. This appeared to be putting more of northern China at risk of conquest by the Japanese, something which was to come true in 1937. Some believe the steps taken by Marshal Zhang were inspired by the Soviets, but there were sufficient grounds for Zhang and Yang Hucheng to act on their own behalf in order to develop an effective resistance to the Japanese invasion.


	...The Xi'an Incident is seen as a turning point for the Chinese Communist Party, as before the incident it was facing a new round of assaults by Kuomintang forces. Chinese nationalism had been roused by the Japanese invasion, but potential Chinese resistance was strengthened by the Xi'an Incident, leading to the United Front of Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party. Ultimately it would benefit the Chinese Communists once the Chinese Civil War revived after the defeat of Japan in 1945.


A shit article

So far sounds like Chaing Kai-sheck wanted to wreck the communists while holding off the Japenese with dimplomacy, then he got arrested by one of his generals, who was apparently a Soviet spy.

Sounds like the CPC-KMT alliance would have been a way to save the CPC if they thought the KMT was going to win? or a way to infiltrate the KMT more

looks like strat was to incite warlord era to destablize China, then use that to grow the CPC

what was the role of Japan? clearly used as a scapegoat in a few places

also helps destablize?

and also could be used to control the conflict, incite conflict between Japan and China if CPC is losing

https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-history-behind-Chinas-warlord-era
	It was the weakness of China during the warlord period that many Chinese intellectuals blamed for the royal screwing that China got at Versailles

China also screwed at Versailles? interesting

So Chang Kai-shek's purge kicked off the fighting between KMT and CPC

How did that come about? Kai-shek didn't sound like a good leader

bad advice maybe?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_massacre

So Wang Jingwei was the "left wing" leader of the split.

KMT worked with soviet union, I guess to "help" defeat warlords?

So sounding like grow CPC along with KMT, then split?


	Some National Revolutionary Army commanders with Communist backgrounds who were graduates of Whampoa Military Academy kept their sympathies for the Communists hidden and were not arrested, and many switched their allegiance to the CCP after the start of the Chinese Civil War.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_Military_Academy

Whampoa an avenue of soviet indoctrination for military leaders?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_United_Front
So Sun Yat Sen made a deal with the Bolsheviks, helped grow the communist party to "combat warlordism"?

	Financially the Whampoa Military Academy operated with the support of the Soviet Union. The quality of education was guaranteed by regularly visiting Russian officers. 

article sounds like it was written by a propagandist?

So would they have wanted the purge? Would help energize communist movement

Depends on their level of success in using and infiltrating the KMT

Some book reviews on intelligence


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Zuolin
	Although Zhang had been Japan's proxy in China, Japanese militarists were infuriated by his failure to stop the advance of the Nationalists.

	...In March 1916, after many southern provinces revolted against Yuan Shikai's government, Zhang supported Yuan but expelled a local military governor sent by Duan Qirui to replace him, with some support from local Japanese officers in the Kwangtung Army. Beijing accepted Zhang's authority and Yuan appointed Zhang superintendent of military affairs in Liaoning (known as "Fengtian" until 1929). After Yuan died in June 1916, the new central government named Zhang both military and civil governor of Liaoning, the essential components of a successful warlord.

Maybe was Japanese agent?


	Manchuria shared a long border with Russia, which had been weakened militarily after the October Revolution. The line of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which was under Russian control, ran through northern Manchuria and the land immediately on either side of the tracks was considered to be Russian territory. From 1917 to about 1924 the new Communist government in Moscow was having such difficulties establishing itself in Siberia that often it was not clear who was in charge of operating the railway on the Russian side. Still, Zhang avoided a showdown and after 1924 the Soviets re-established their dominance over the railroad.

	The precariousness of the situation was demonstrated by an outbreak of pneumonic plague in Hailar, a town at the western end of the Chinese Eastern Railway, in October 1920. Chinese troops were present in great number and turned railway quarantine into a farce. The soldiers freed some of their comrades who had been imprisoned as contacts, and they escaped to the mining town of Dalainor on the Amur River, where a quarter of the population succumbed. In the other direction, all of the towns along the Chinese Eastern Railway as far as Vladivostok were infected. Around 9,000 died, while only a few contacts were able to reach south Manchuria


What's going on here? Maybe not a Japanese agent...

Mao the unkown story

Something off about this book? I would have thought Stalin's goal was to conquer China, not "hold off" Japan

At first I had Mao figured for more of a useful idiot than pure evil? I mean I'm pretty sure he was less evil than Stalin

A key question is what was his motive in the famine? was he a moron or was he evil in that case?

was he an agent of theirs? could simply be disloyal to China


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong#Resuming_civil_war:_1940.E2.80.931949
	After the end of World War II, the U.S. continued their military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and his KMT government forces against the People's Liberation Army (PLA) led by Mao Zedong during the civil war. Likewise, the Soviet Union gave quasi-covert support to Mao by their occupation of north east China, which allowed the PLA to move in en masse and take large supplies of arms left by the Japanese's Kwantung Army.


	...In 1948, under direct orders from Mao, the People's Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying the city of Changchun. At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the siege, which lasted from June until October. PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang Zhenglu, who documented the siege in his book White Snow, Red Blood, compared it to Hiroshima: "The casualties were about the same. Hiroshima took nine seconds; Changchun took five months."[158] On January 21, 1949, Kuomintang forces suffered great losses in decisive battles against Mao's forces.[159] In the early morning of December 10, 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chongqing and Chengdu on mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek fled from the mainland to Formosa (Taiwan).


	...Mao himself claimed that a total of 700,000 people were killed in attacks on "counter-revolutionaries" during the years 1950–52.[169] However, because there was a policy to select "at least one landlord, and usually several, in virtually every village for public execution",[170] the number of deaths range between 2 million[170][171] and 5 million.[172][173] In addition, at least 1.5 million people,[174] perhaps as many as 4 to 6 million,[175] were sent to "reform through labour" camps where many perished.[175] Mao played a personal role in organizing the mass repressions and established a system of execution quotas,[176] which were often exceeded.[166] He defended these killings as necessary for the securing of power.[177]


regardless get the sense that they continued their efforts to destroy China after they took control. So the famine and killings would be one way to do that.

Interesting that apparently China still went through ecnomic growth even while the famine and killings were going on. Maybe Russia was worried China would grow powerful and oppose them despite taking them over? Like there clearly would have been forces loyal to China even in Mao's government. So that could explain the absurd excuses for killing that were enacted. Racing to destroy China any way they can.

Was that what he was up to? just try to get away with killing as many as he could?

He could also just have been a psycopath selected by the Soviets for this purpose. So not necessarily acting on their orders, but acting toward their whims.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong#Resuming_civil_war:_1940.E2.80.931949
	Following the consolidation of power, Mao launched the First Five-Year Plan (1953–58). The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become a world power. With the Soviet Union's assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell[clarification needed] to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support.[citation needed] The success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second Five-Year Plan in 1958. 

Ok so they encouraged their growth

And Kissinger opened up trade with them too, which helped them grow economically

So why the killing? population control? They did do the same with the one-child policy (another Okhrana project? would help to destablize China at least)

Ok it was the second "great leap forward" where they started killing en masse. So it could be they just thought China would become a threat by then?

	Li Zhisui, Mao's physician, suggested that Mao had initially seen the policy as a way of weakening opposition to him within the party and that he was surprised by the extent of criticism and the fact that it came to be directed at his own leadership.

	...Mao's physician believed that he may have been unaware of the extent of the famine, partly due to a reluctance to criticise his policies, and the willingness of his staff to exaggerate or outright fake reports regarding food production

So Li Zhisui supports the idea that Mao was a "useful idiot."

Other book makes him seem pure evil. Although could always be both!

He wrote "The Private Life of Chairman Mao"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Life_of_Chairman_Mao
	After publication, several people criticized the publication process. Tai claimed that the English-language publisher, Random House, wanted more sensationalist elements to the book than that which Li had provided them, in particular requesting more information about Mao's sexual relationships. Despite Li's own protestations, they overruled him, and put such claims in the published text.[4] Li claimed that Thurston cut substantial parts of his original manuscript without his knowledge.

interesting

	A significant theme in the book is Li's gradual transition from his initial sincere admiration for Mao as a leader of the country to his eventual disgust, contempt and personal dislike of the leader due to Mao's manipulation of people and events, odd sexual habits, abuses of power, substitution of slogans and cult of personality for knowledge of modern science or administrative ability, and above all Mao's indifference to the suffering of the general population due to his failed policies. Throughout the book Li compares Mao to the historical Chinese Emperors in the tactics he used to control people around him, noting Mao's frequent references to and reading of the histories of Imperial China.

Seems legit?

This guy says Mao was stupid

Maybe Mao was like their Donald Trump? stupid and evil.

	Again after the Founding of the People's Republc, Mao had a big battle with the overseas educated intellectuals, who backed by Stalin, urged that China build itself up after a decade of war, using so-called New Economic Policy of encouraging a class of "patriotic capitalists" to build up new business and expand throughout China. Mao insisted that only by following Stalin's method of complete collectivization of agriculture and nationalization of industry would China prosper, indeed become greater than the Soviet Union.

http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/world/stalin-mao-alliance-was-uneasy-newly-released-papers-show.html
 	WASHINGTON, Dec. 9— Scholars have unearthed official records of the two meetings between Stalin and Mao. Along with Mao's commentaries on the meetings, they suggest that the Chinese-Soviet alliance that the two men made in Moscow 45 winters ago was founded on shaky ground.

	The transcripts of the December 1949 and January 1950 sessions, obtained from Soviet archives, had long been sought by historians of the cold war.

real or fake? supposedly there was a "Sino-Soviet split" fakeout, so this could have been part of it.

	Mao admired Stail and felt that he alone had the stature to be the world's next Stalin.

	...Years later, Mao refused to criticize Stalin in public, even after Stalin had been unfrocked by his own colleagues. But he told colleagues in November 1956, "in my entire life I have three times written in praise of Stalin. ...None of this writing was done willingly - I had to say these things."

He sounds like Trump

	Zhu De had not been prepared for Krushchev's attack, and when he cabled Mao with the news and asked for instructions on how to respond, the former military commander suggested that China support Krushchev's critique. Mao was furios. "Zhu De is an ignorant man," he fumed. "Krushchev and Zhu De are both unreliabe.

	Mao had an almost mystical faith in the role of the leader.

ok there it is. He was Stalin's Trump. Book first published in 1994.

later he says Mao despised Stalin? what?

He was upset that Stalin didn't pick him to be glorious leader at first...


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Minghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Ming


Mao also mentions that Stalin screwed him over with support against KMT?

	I had always heard that much of the weaponry the Chinese communist forces used during the civil war was from the Soviet Union, left behind when the Soviets evacuated Manchuria at the end of the Second World War. Mao, though, could not admit that the Soviets had helped at all, and I was in no position to argue.

	...I had always thought that China and the Soviet Union had cooperated during the war, but Mao insisted that they had not. "During the Korean War, when the American army reached the border between China and Korea at the Yalu River, I told Stalin we had to send our forces down there to fight," Mao said. But Stalin had said no. He thought it would be the beginning of the Third World War.


What's going on here? Maybe advisors would give Mao Stalin's ideas then Stalin would be coy about it?

	Mao would fight anyway, but he wanted Soviet weapons.


Ok maybe Stalin was trying to get Mao to do what he wants without Mao knowing, get Mao to insist to do something that Stalin wants him to do anyway, then "Ok but it'll cost you"

Make Mao think it was his idea and milk him for all he's worth. Similarities with Trump again seem uncanny, Trump thinking he's the best at "making deals."


	...Mao was trying to tell Edgar Snow that he was a god and law unto himself, wafu wutian.

	"I graduated from the University of Outlaws," Mao used to tell me. He was a consummate rebel. He rebelled against all authority and had to be in control of every situation--from decisions at the highest reaches of political power to the most mundate details of his everyday life.

	...It is true, though, that Mao had no friends and was isolated from normal human contact. He spent little time with his wife and even less with his children. So far as I could tell, despite his initial friendliness at first meetings, Mao was devoid of human feeling, cincapable of love, friendship, or warmth. Once, in SHanghai, I was sitting next to the Chairman during a performance when a young acrobat--a child--suddenyl slipped and was seriously injured. The crowd was aghast, transfixed by the tragedy, and the child's mother was inconsolabe. But Mao continued talking and laughing without concern, as though nothing had happened. Nor, to my knowledge, did he ever inquire about the fate of the young performer.

Mao is Trump
	
	He reveled in his own unpredictability.	

	...I was shocked to learn not only that Mao identified with China's emperors but that his greatest admiration was reserved for the most ruthless and cruel of our country's tyrants.

	...

	Countless people died when Sui Yangdi ordered the building of the Grand Canal. But Mao ranked Sui Yangdi with the best. China's rivers all flow west to east. The Grand Canal linked the country north to south, serving as a belt to bind the country. Sui Yangdi was also a great unifier.

Like Trump, admiring dictators and building things over his country's people

	...Mao wanted to stay and monitor the situation, finally deciding to send Chinese soldiers--secretly, and wearing Vietnamese uniforms--to fight the United States

So they just had useful idiots in China and the U.S. and used them to help destroy each other. Divide and Conquer on a global scale.

	I am convinced that the intrigues in China's ancient imperial courts were a far more powerful influence on his though thatn Marxism-Leninism. ...His aim was to transform China, to make it rich and powerful time.

Make China Great Again

	Mao had grandiose ideas of his own place in history. He never had any doubt about his own role. He was the greatest leader, the greatest emperor, of them all--the man who had unifed the country and would then transform it, the man who was restoring China to its original greatness.

	As the Chinese try to understand the unprecedented US president, the populist tone in his inauguration speech that claims to "give the power back to the American people" has resonated with the revolutionary catchphrases of late Chairman Mao Zedong among the conservatives.

	..."The best parts of Trump's speech are imbued with Chairman Mao's thoughts … The historic significance of Trump's speech is no less than the Declaration of Independence," said an article on WeChat public account Canghaishibei, with an apparent leftist inclination. The article said Trump's address has "class struggle" at its soul, although the words were not explicitly stated. The speech is thrilling for many in China, it claims.

	Stalin is our greatest father and teacher. In the name of Chinese people and Chinese Communist Party, we celebrate comrade Stalin's seventy birthday. May he be in the best health and live a long life! Leader of both the world's working class and Communist Internationale — Ten thousand years of life to Stalin!


http://www.massline.org/SingleSpark/Stalin/StalinMaoEval.htm
	“Stalin is the true friend of the Chinese nation and of the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. The Chinese people’s love and respect for Stalin, and our friendship for the Soviet Union, are wholly sincere. Any attempt, from whatever quarter, to sow dissension by rumor-mongering and slander will be of no avail in the end.”
      —“Stalin Is the Friend of the Chinese People” (Dec. 20, 1939), MRP7, pp. 307-308, in full. A different translation is available in SW2, pp. 335-6.


	...Who is the commander of the revolutionary front? It is socialism, it is Stalin. Comrade Stalin is the leader of the world revolution. This is an extremely important circumstance. Among the whole human race, this man, Stalin, has appeared, and this is a very great event. Because he is there, it is easer to get things done. As you know, Marx is dead, and Engels and Lenin too are dead. If there were no Stalin, who would give the orders? This is indeed a fortunate circumstance. Because there is now in the world a Soviet Union, a Communist Party, and a Stalin, the affairs of this world can be dealt with more easily. What does a revolutionary commander do? He sees to it that everyone has food to eat, clothes to wear, a place to live, and books to read. And in order to achieve this, he must lead a billion and more people to struggle against the oppressors and bring them to a final victory. This is precisely what Stalin wants to do. Since this is the case, should not all those who suffer oppression congratulate Stalin? I think they should, I think they must. We should congratulate him, support him and study him.


	...“Apart from helping us from the doctrinal standpoint in our War of Resistance Against Japan, Stalin has also given us practical and concrete aid. Since the victory of Stalin’s cause, he has aided us with many airplanes, cannons, aviators, and military advisers in every theater of operations, as well as lending us money. What other country in the world has helped us in this way? What country in the world, led by what class, party, or individual, has helped us in this way? Who is there, apart from the Soviet Union, the proletariat, the Communist Party, and Stalin?


	...“After we have celebrated Stalin’s birthday, we must continue to carry out propaganda among the people of the whole country to make these facts known. We must explain things clearly to the 450 million Chinese, so that our whole people understands: only the socialist Soviet Union, only Stalin, are the good friends of China.”
      —Speech at a Meeting of All Circles in Yan’an to Commemorate Stalin’s Sixtieth Birthday (Dec. 21, 1939), MRP7, pp. 309-11, in full.


	...Comrade Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the greatest genius of the present age,


	...“Comrade Stalin’s contribution to our era through his theoretical activities and practice is incalculable. Comrade Stalin represented our entire new age. His activities have led the Soviet people and the working people of all countries to turn around the whole world situation.


	...“All of Comrade Stalin’s writings are immortal documents of Marxism. His works, The Foundations of Leninism, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union [Bolshevik], and his last great work, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, constitute an encyclopedia of Marxism-Leninism, a synthesis of the experience of the world Communist movement of the past hundred years. His speech at the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a precious last testament bequeathed to the Communists of all the countries of the world. We Chinese Communists, like the Communists of all countries, search for our own road to victory in the great works of Comrade Stalin.

    The chaos caused was on a grand scale and I take responsibility. Comrades, you must all analyse your own responsibility. If you have to shit, shit! If you have to fart, fart! You will feel much better for it.
        Speech At The Lushan Conference (23 July 1959)

    Maybe you're afraid of sinking. Don't think about it. If you don't think about it, you won't sink. If you do, you will.
        Swimming advice to physician Zhisui Li (1966), quoted in The TIME 100 (13 April 1998)



[Mao] has played politics with Asian cunning. … [and] has always been a master at concealing his true intention. … I was always on my guard with him.

    Nikita Khrushchev, as quoted in A. Doak Barnett (1977) China and the major powers in East Asia, page 352

	When we look at a thing, we must examine its essence and treat its appearance merely as an usher at the threshold, and once we cross the threshold, we must grasp the essence of the thing; this is the only reliable and scientific method of analysis. 

	“A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire” (January 5, 1930), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 119.


	Marxist philosophy holds that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law operates universally, whether in the natural world, in human society, or in man's thinking. Between the opposites in a contradiction there is at once unity and struggle, and it is this that impels things to move and change. Contradictions exist everywhere, but they differ in accordance with the different nature of different things. In any given phenomenon or thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary and transitory, and hence relative, whereas the struggle of opposites is absolute.

	Chiang Kai-shek, meanwhile, had succeeded in unifying China under the Kuomintang, and Zhang Xue- liang (Chang Hsueh-liang), Manchuria’s new warlord, supported the Nationalist, or Kuomintang, government. In 1931 clashes broke out between Korean farmers who were Japanese subjects and Chinese farmers over water rights.

	Doihara went to Manchuria and determined that a Japanese attempt to seize Manchuria would result in international condemnation. An “incident” had to be manufactured to make a Japanese occupation of Manchuria seem China’s fault. In 1929 the Kwantung Army began to plot an incident under their new boss, Lieutenant General Shigeru Honjo, with Doihara as mastermind.

	Japan’s civilian leaders did nothing to control the insubordinate Kwantung Army. The emperor, however, ordered Major General Yoshitsugu Tatekawa to bring a message from him on September 15, 1931, ordering the Kwantung Army not to take any unauthorized action. Unfortunately for Hirohito, Tatekawa’s assistant, Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto, was among the plotters, and he sent a message to officers of the Kwantung Army to let them know that Tatekawa was coming with imperial orders. When Tatekawa arrived in Mukden on September 17, Kwantung Army officers took the general to a party, where he became drunk.

	That night Kwantung Army officers blew up a section of track on the South Manchurian Railway 1,200 yards from a Chinese army that failed to derail the night express. Kwantung Army troops then attacked and shelled the Chinese barracks, killing many soldiers. By 10:00 a. m. on September 18, 1931, Mukden was under Japanese control, Chang’s headquarters were ransacked, and his banks and government offices were occupied, as were a dozen other cities in southern Manchuria in a coordinated attack by Japanese units. Some 12 hours after their blast, Kwantung Army officers displayed to Western reporters the “proof” that the Chinese had tried to destroy the railroad, which was bodies of Chinese soldiers shot in the back lying facedown, supposedly cut down while fleeing the scene. The world was outraged by the political adventurism, and Tokyo was stunned. The emperor reminded Prime Minister Reijiro Wakatsuki that he had forbidden such action, and the foreign and finance ministers also objected. But Wakatsuki did not overrule his generals and colonels. The attack and subsequent conquest of Manchuria were accepted as a fait accompli.

These clowns involved in Mukden incident too?

https://trialinternational.org/latest-post/kingoro-hashimoto/
	Hashimoto is also said to have plotted the military seizure of Manchuria by participating in the planning of the Mukden incident of 18 September 1931, which provided the pretext for the annexation of the region by Japan a few months later. In that occasion, Japanese militaries orchestrated a fake sabotage to a Japanese railway line in north-eastern China, which was later attributed by the Imperial Army of Japan to Chinese dissident and assumed as justification to invade China. Therefore, Hashimoto was allegedly the major instigator of the second Sino-Japanese war and acted as a commander in the field during the military campaign.

	Colonel Yasue Norihiro: Army expert in Jewish topics and anti-Semitic ideology, believing strongly in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norihiro_Yasue
	At the age of 33, Captain Yasue was assigned as part of the Japanese intervention in Siberia, to aid the Russian White Army in their struggle against the Bolshevik Red Army. A Russian-language specialist, he was assigned to the staff of General Gregorii Semenov, a vehement anti-Semite who distributed copies of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to all of his troops, along with weapons and rations. Along with a few dozen other Japanese soldiers, Yasue read and accepted the premises of the Protocols, and would allow this to guide much of his actions and views into the time of the beginning of World War II.

	After his return to Japan in 1922, Yasue worked in the Army Intelligence Bureau, translating the Protocols of the Elders of Zion into Japanese, while continuing to speak with Inuzuka and a handful of others about the Jewish problem in Russia. Their group grew quickly, publishing articles in internal army journals, and holding informal lectures and discussion groups. Following the publishing of his translation of the Protocols, Yasue attracted the attention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was sent in 1926 to Palestine to research the Jewish people


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreshige_Inuzuka
	Colonel Yasue Norihiro, he held to an anti-Semitic ideology, believing strongly in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion; 


	After the war, he was stationed off the coast of Vladivostok during the Siberian Intervention to aid the White Russians against the Bolshevik Red Army. It was there that he first heard of and read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a powerful anti-Semitic document detailing a Jewish worldwide conspiracy. The document was forged and distributed by Russian General Gregorii Semenov, a leader of the White forces.

	In 1922, after returning to Japan, Inuzuka began to gather a coterie of sympathetic officers who believed in the Protocols. This group of so-called 'Jewish-experts' slowly became larger and more outspoken over the next several years. The group published many documents detailing their thoughts on the Jewish conspiracy, including lists of known Jews, and a Japanese translation of the Protocols, written by Yasue. After serving as a military attaché to France,


	...As war with China approached in the 1930s, Inuzuka came to support the 'Manchurian faction,' a number of military men who believed that control of Manchuria was crucial to Japan's survival.

	After World War II, the Allies prosecuted Ōkawa as a class-A war criminal. Of the twenty-eight people indicted with this charge, he was the only one who wasn't a military officer or government official. The Allkes described him to the press as the "Japanese Goebbels" and claimed that he had long agitated for a war between Japan and the West. In pre-trial hearings, Okawa countered that he had merely translated and commented on Vladimir Solovyov's geopolitical philosophy in 1924, and that in fact Pan-Asianism did not advocate for war


Involved in coups, fascism, anti-Western sentiment, and Indian independence movement.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Solovyov_%28philosopher%29
	A vigorous anti-Asian racist, Solovyov spent his last years obsessed with the fear of the "Yellow Peril", constantly warning that soon the Asian peoples, especially the Chinese, would invade and destroy Russia.[9] In a 1890 article entitled "China and Europe", in the journal Review, Solovyov wrote that the great struggle of the coming 20th century would be a war between China which was "yellow", "pagan" and completely "evil" vs. the Europe which was "white", "Christian" and completely "good".

	...Solovyov further elaborated on the "Yellow Peril" in his apocalyptic short story "Tale of the Antichrist" published in the Nedelya newspaper on 27 February 1900, where China and Japan join forces to conquer Russia.[10] Solovyov began his story with the epigraph: "Pan Mongolism! The name is monstrous Yet it caresses my ear As if filled with the portent Of a grand divine fate".[10] In his story, the Japanese, after having adopted modern technology following the Meiji Restoration, teach the Chinese modern science and technology, after which a combined Sino-Japanese army conquers Europe.[11] After a long era of occupation, the Europeans rise up, defeat and kill all of the Asians and then establish a "United States of Europe", living together in peace and prosperity as the various European powers have all learned that their real enemy is the Asians, not each other.[

	Segments of the Chinese Nationalist and of the Japan underground government are attempting to implement plans to provoke a third World War.


???

	This is being done in the name of Greater Asian-ism with the purpose of fostering an asiatic race liberation movement and reviving the influence of the Chinese Nationalist Government. OKAWA Shumei reportedly emphasized the fact that only through a third world War can complete independence of Asia be realized.

	...These four men are reported to be planning in secret the reconstruction of the Japanese military. "Their initial aim is the organization of a volunteer corps to join the Chinese Nationalists in their defense of Formosa and then to gradually increase the size and equipment of the group until it becomes a power for those whose service both the East and West will bid prior to the inevitable World War III."

In 1919, he expressed the idea that the reconstruction of Japanese society was necessary in order to fight communist aggression. That same year he was hired by the South Manchurian Railway Company, a Japanese company, to run the editorial section of the East Asian Economic Research Bureau (EAERB) in Tokyo. He held this position until the end of the war, when the Bureau was disbanded. In 1928, he became chairman of the board of directors of the Research Bureau.

During the same period, he continued to pursue his academic career, and, in 1926, he received his Ph. D. from the Tokyo Imperial University. He also published several works, one of which, in 1942, was an essay on “The Concept of Islam”.

Well known as a Japanese ultra-nationalist, Pan-Asian writer, and Islamic scholar, prior to 1928, he was said to have publicly advocated Japanese territorial expansion throughout the Asian continent by simple threat or, if necessary, by the use of military force.

Bluecher was born in the Yaroslavl district near the Volga in 1889. 
His German-sounding name came remotely from Russo-German 
landlords nearby, but he is pure Russian ; many Russians in this area 
have German names. He was a factory worker and mechanic, and in 
1905 — still a boy — joined the revolution. During the Great War he 
fought as a conscript. He was wounded and cited for bravery, and in 
1917 helped organize the early military soviets in Leningrad. He rose 
rapidly, and led various detachments in the civil wars. He fought on 
the Siberian front, and in fact saved the Far East for Russia, because

Later he found himself — quite by chance — a fellow passenger on the

	For this purpose the Army has at hand the nucleus of an organization which simply requires expansion. Under the leadership of Lieutenant-General Yoshitsugu Tatekawa, retired, with the cooperation of other retired officers (Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto, Colonel Junichiro Kobayashi, Vice Admiral Shozaburo Kobayashi) there was held on November 15, 1936, a conference of military organization leaders to discuss the formation of a party temporarily called the “restoration” party. Making use of already existing patriotic societies and reactionary organizations, this movement has already shown great activity and will probably be developed further by the Army in the present political contingency. The lessons to be derived from the monopoly parties so effectively employed by Hitler and Mussolini have not been without a hearing among army men in Japan. Already
	
	in Manchuria, where the Kwantung Army is able to try out its political philosophy, the Concordia party is carrying into execution political ideas which are undoubtedly entertained by the Army for Japan itself.

	Hashimoto Kingoro, a former army officer, and Nakano Seigo, a politician who
advocated the "Southern Advance," were two who took after Hitler and copied his
style. I went to their speeches, all of them. Sometimes I'd be thrown out. Their
supporters would demand to see my student ID and then say I wasn't old
enough. Somehow, they didn't like students. So I'd take off my school uniform
and sneak in. The meetings were held at the Hibiya Public Hall, Whenever
extreme right-wing talks were given, on subjects like "Attack Britain and
America," enormous crowds came. People brought box lunches and formed long
lines from six in the morning to get in and hear Nakano Seigo endorsing the
liberation of Asia. Even then, sometimes you couldn't get in. This was in 1940
and early '41, before the war. When you heard these talks, you felt as if your
burdens had been lifted. You were satisfied. The audience would be carried
away with enthusiasm for the ideals and theories of the Co-
Prosperity Sphere.
Nagai Ryutaro was another brilliant orator and people loved his tone. He, too,
advocated Asia for Asians. I loved the atmosphere of his talks. When Britain
lodged a protest with Japan because a British gunboat was sunk by Japan in
China, they denounced the British, saying, "While they're engaged in aggressive
acts, how dare they complain about the Japanese army there?" They called on
us to protest against the British Empire. I myself once went to a demonstration at
the British embassy where I joined in shouting, "Britain get out of China! Stop
your aggression! What are you doing in the Orient?" We couldn't accept their
presence in what they called the Far East.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall#Analysis_of_Pearl_Harbor_intelligence_failure
	In December 1945, President Harry Truman sent Marshall to China, to broker a coalition government between the Nationalist allies under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Communists under Mao Zedong. Marshall had no leverage over the Communists, but he threatened to withdraw American aid essential to the Nationalists. Both sides rejected his proposals and the Chinese Civil War escalated, with the Communists winning in 1949. His mission a failure, he returned to the United States in January 1947.[42][43] Chiang Kai-shek and some historians later claimed that cease-fire, under pressure of Marshall, saved the Communists from defeat.[44][45] As Secretary of State in 1947–48, Marshall seems to have disagreed with strong opinions in The Pentagon and State Department that Chiang's success was vital to American interests, insisting that U.S. troops not become involved.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War#Resumed_fighting_.281946.E2.80.931949.29
	Although General Marshall stated that he knew of no evidence that the CPC was being supplied by the Soviet Union, the CPC was able to utilize a large number of weapons abandoned by the Japanese, including some tanks, but it was not until large numbers of well-trained KMT troops began surrendering and joining the Communist forces that the CPC was finally able to master the hardware.

Marshall one of theirs?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy
	Truman's Secretary of Defense, George Catlett Marshall, was the target of some of McCarthy's most vitriolic rhetoric. Marshall had been Army Chief of Staff during World War II and was also Truman's former Secretary of State. Marshall was a highly respected General and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the Marshall Plan for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled America's Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall. Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the loss of China to Communism. In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason;[72] declared that "if Marshall were merely stupid, the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country's interest";[72] and most famously, accused him of being part of "a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man".

McCarthy ahead of his time

McCarthy one of theirs too? best way to get someone to believe a lie is pretend to be crazy and tell them the truth

	Decades after McCarthy's death, it has been argued that the Venona project—which decrypted Soviet messages, Soviet espionage data now opened to the West, and newly released transcripts of closed hearings before McCarthy's subcommittee—partially vindicated McCarthy by showing that many of his identifications of Communists were correct, and that the scale of Soviet espionage activity in the U.S. during the 1940s and 1950s was larger than many suspected. These suggestions have been the subject of dispute.

could also have just been attacked by all their journalists 

	McCarthy and President Truman clashed often during the years both held office. McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on, or even in league with, Communists, and spoke of the Democrats' "twenty years of treason". 

Ok here he is politicizing it. Sounds like one of theirs

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy
	During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower campaign toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In a speech delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared that while he agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall

Amazing

	Among those implicated in files later made public from the Venona project and Soviet sources were Cedric Belfrage, Frank Coe, Lauchlin Currie, Harold Glasser, David Karr, Mary Jane Keeney, and Leonard Mins.

	-U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall (CFR) — a key player in handing China to Chairman Mao’s murderous communists, and perhaps mass-murdering dictator Joseph Stalin’s most important ally in the world — called for European “economic cooperation” as a precondition for the desperately needed American aid after the war.

	Verne Newton was hitchhiking through Africa on 50 cents a day when he ran into a U.S. senator. It was the mid-1960s, and Newton had left college to see the world from London to Capetown. But after he met the senator, he saw something else: an image of himself back in the United States, on Capitol Hill. It didn’t seem so unreachable.

	“I’ll go back,” he thought, “go to school in Washington because that’s the capital for politics, and I’ll soak that up and eventually return to Iowa and run for office.”

	Like most youthful plans, things didn’t quite turn out that way. Instead, the push and pull between scholarship and politics became a kind of cyclical rhythm that shaped Newton’s life.

	“I’ve really had multiple careers,” says Newton, who has worked for several presidents, won regard as a Roosevelt scholar, headed a top Africa post at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), served as director of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Presidential Library, and is now director of the library at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York.

hmm, who writes something like this?


http://www.newsweek.com/soviet-spy-hiding-plain-sight-wartime-london-365175
	My forthcoming publication of the diary of Ivan Maisky, the ubiquitous Soviet ambassador to London, 1932-43, casts doubt on such assertion. Maisky had a front-row seat at some of the most pivotal events of the interwar era, recording them in the only diary to have been written by a major Soviet official during Stalin’s great terror. In its full version it encompasses more than 1,500 densely handwritten pages.

	They establish that the harsh reality of the rise of Nazism dictated a shift from attempts to mobilize socialist solidarity and support for the Russian Revolution among British Labour circles and leftist sympathisers, to courting the Conservatives, who were, as Litvinov, the Soviet commissar for foreign affairs, never tired of stressing to Maisky—“the real bosses in Britain!”

	A superb public relations man, at a time when the concept hardly existed, Maisky did not shy away from aligning himself with royalty, bankers in the city, opposition groups, backbenchers and newspaper editors. He colluded with Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, Lord Beaverbrook and Lloyd George, seeking to sway prime minister Neville Chamberlain from appeasing Hitler toward an alliance with the Soviet Union.

Sounds like Kislyak. Except I don't know if you can be that good at "persuasion" for so many high-level people...

why do they care about these sort of things? conspiritards go bannanas about it and you can see it a lot in their propaganda.


How do they think of themselves? Do they think they are a part of some super-secret club? they do like to found them (Chinese Assassiation Corp, Black Hand, Aufbau, others).

Mostly seems like they like gaining power and messing with people's heads.

But some of their killing doesn't make sense even if all they care about is power I think? they could just be insane


https://www.biblebelievers.org.au/przion1.htm#PREFACE
	"God has granted to us, His Chosen People, the gift of dispersion, and from this, which appears to all eyes to be our weakness, has come forth all our strength, which has now brought us to the threshold of sovereignty over all the world." 

so they would obviously known there was a Jewish Diaspora and that there was anti-semitism all over the world. So this would be a matter of expediency, knowing they were going to basically create (or had already created) a hated group doing active measures all over the world, so the jews would be a natural scapegoat.

	Its first stage in Europe was in 429BC in Greece, where, about the time of Pericles, the Snake first started eating into the power of that country. The second stage was in Rome in the time of Augustus, about 69BC. The third in Madrid in the time of Charles V, in AD1552. The fourth in Paris about 1790, in the time of Louis XVI. The fifth in London from 1814 onwards (after the downfall of Napoleon). The sixth in Berlin in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian war. The seventh in St. Petersburg, over which is drawn the head of the Snake under the date of 1881. 

This how they think of themselves? "scourge of empires"

	[This "Snake" is now being drawn through the Americas and in the United States of America, it has been partially identified as the "Council on Foreign Relations" (C.F.R.) and the "Trilateral Commission"]. 

Did get a sense that the new scapegoat is mostly now the CIA, George Soros, and basically anyone who opposes them or who they don't like

Why still bother with it? do they actually expect people to believe it? or are they just "proud" of their "history?"

They could figure if even a few otherwise mentally capable people believe it, they can find them and promote them to positions of power

	It must be noted that men with bad instincts are more in number than the good, and therefore the best results in governing them are attained by violence and terrorisation, and not by academic discussions. Every man aims at power, everyone would like to become a dictator if only he could, and rare indeed are the men who would not be willing to sacrifice the welfare of all for the sake of securing their own welfare. 

This is telling... they might actually believe this?

In actuality only ~5% of people are believed to be sociopaths, although you don't have to be a sociopath to be power hungry. But you more or less do to kill as many people as they do in the way they do

	>You speak of blackmail webs. How does one avoid them?

	Often, if you seek power, you will be framed even if you do not engage in blackmail worthy behavior.

	If this doesn't work and you are sufficiently threatening, you will be executed.

	If you want to exercise power in the world, you must abide by reality, and therefore the law of the jungle. If you can't wave a big stick, don't threaten a big animal.

They might believe in the "law of the jungle" because they practice it. Like people want to follow laws and rules but they have a sort of science of how to subvert them

	The lesson you should take from events like Seth Rich is that good intent is worthless without good plans.

	You guys do a good job of questioning what you are told in a detail oriented fashion, but not in the abstract.

	You need to emerge from your indoctrination into the real world and appreciate principles of reality such as the law of the jungle. 


seemed smart but very unlikely to be that "high-level." So guessing this could be a lower-level propagandist. But this could give a hint into what they actually believe, although for this guy in particular have to work out what they actually believe vs. what they wanted people to believe. They did advertise Mr. "high-level insider" all over reddit.

Their propagandists on 4chan at least seem to buy some of this. Like they view morality as a weakness. If he was one of their propagandists, this could give some insight into what those types actually believe. Sometimes they seemed to be open and acknowledge what they were doing ("we live inside your head rent-free!")


This sort of "law of the jungle" and power over morality kind of thing might be how the recruit? it would be especially appealing to sociopaths I'd imagine. Without communism they still need some kind of ideology to recruit and "justify" what they do.

So the ideology so far looks like some kind of moral relativism, the "west" is hypocritical and just "use" morality as a tool to impose rules on people in their benefit, ideals like peace, democracy, rule of law don't matter, what matters in the "real world" is power.

	Self-interest. It's not a zero sum world. 

A lot of them might actually believe this. There would be a pressure to for a lot of them to justify their behavior.

But this would justify to them some of what they do, like global warming, causing or almost causing nuclear war. They would rather rule a radioactive wasteland than see humanity flourish.

In hand with this is a sort of disdain for people who care about the world, seeing them as naive. So a lot of times they label their viewpoint as "realist" or "pragmatic."

Problem is even still they plant wacos in environmentalist groups to help create that perception and must have known what they were doing when they labeled their bullshit as "realism." It's hard to guess how much of their bullshit they actually believe.

Guessing that likely the people at the "top" don't really care about ideology except how to use it as a tool. That was the Okhrana's schtick for generations. So they whole thing would just be a way to keep themselves in power. They might choose to believe the "law of the jungle" and "zero-sum game" ideologies at least to justify their own behavior. But they are right that some people only care about power and gaining it for no end other than to gain more. They would know if they are that type of person.

	Consider the tale of the emperor who has no clothes.

	When everyone fails to point out that the emperor is naked, new generations arise that can no longer distinguish between the states of being clothed or naked.

	You've reached a point where even your leaders don't know what they are doing anymore.

You have not really thought about what all such a process entails.

What if we seize power and push out the blackmail network. They won't just go quietly and we don't have the means to kill them all overnight, nor even consensus that we should if we could.

So you are dealing with a broad and organized network of malcontents resisting your efforts to improve, plus the government is highly unstable because people have no reason to trust it and are predisposed to revolution.

This isn't a trivial exercise you are proposing.

>Can you give us an overview of the different factions? 

The major power factions in the world are analogous to dark priests, good priests, kings, and (in theory) meritocracies.

Dark priests - these people believe that beauty emerges from contrast. Evil is necessary for good kind of thing. They are not necessarily pro-evil, but pro-contrast.

Kings - generally less intelligent than dark priests. Much of their code of behavior derives from a belief in the past that you need a slave class to sustain an enlightened class.

Meritocracy - they believe in something similar to democratic rule, but only with votes for the initiated, because the masses are hopeless.

Us - we're more interested in the emperor without clothes effect. The exercise of power has always come with a stifling of dissent and dangerous dips into psychosis. We try to undermine this tendency more than anything else. 


not sure what this means. He seems to honestly think he's doing good? I guess most people want to believe that. He claims he wants to expose the truth.

telling. Why do they want global warming anyway? there are theories like they want Russia to be warmer, or they just want to be able to keep selling oil since they have a lot. I had wondered if they just want it to create opportunities to destablize the world again. They have that kind of mindset, like spreading the idelogy of anarchy to destablize the world before WW1 and WW2.

Not sure if they care that much about Russia. Like iirc Russia has less population on the coastline, so global warming would hurt almost every other nation except Russia and give them a comparative advantage. So that would "justify" it from a strictly pro-Russian perpsective.

But they have killed millions of Russians before, and WW2 and operation Barbarossa should count toward that.

Besides, I get the sense that they are trying to "transform" U.S. culture and U.S. political culture and that of their intelligence agencies and military to be more like theirs and be more amenable to how they recruit and gain power. So they could act in ways to always destroy America and benefit Russia like global warming according to some, but they might see it better to "switch over" to America or just take it over like they are doing now. Some of them were born in America anyway.

Insists that Lin could not possibly have been a soviet agent, citing border conflcits and some of the "hard line" words he said about them.

But if there were a deliberate effort to have a Sino-Soviet split fakeout then, these points don't do so much to "save" him

Says Lin had "susbstantial military support" in South China. and was "alleged that he had alternate plans to establish a separate administration"

Interesting if true.

Actually would doubt Lin would take a plane to the Soviet Union unless he was shit scared and stopped caring about appearances or something. But he does look like one of their agents, so not at all surprised he would want to "defect" as the Chinese government put it.

Casts doubt on idea that Lin Biao was in the crash.

"Chinese government has not been able to provide convincing proof"

Says testimony of Xu Wenyi "is not persuasive"

"Most questionable of all is the official explanation itself o this alleged plot ...Even if one must rely only on the evidence provided by the available party documents, it is hard to believe these charges against Lin Biao."

Says the coup plan wasn't good and Lin Biao was smarter than that.

no idea can't judge a coup plan... maybe a deliberate failed coup like what supposedly happened in Turkey? A failed coup against Mao would help him crack down and gain more power.

Plugs Yao Ming-le's book "The Conspiracy and Death of Mao's Heir"

Says it has "shortcomings" though. Says don't know who Yao is, "strong suspicioun the book is basically fradulent." "Remember though that the guy who wrote the introduction was a top-notch China-watcher journalist"

Something familiar here. Implying the Lin Biao thing and the purge afterward was politically motivated, "why does the Chinese Government lie 100% all of the time?"

Looks like the Lin Boa affair was them purging more soviet agents out of their ranks, maybe like the Zhou and Bo Xilai thing that happened recently.

Clearly a lot of them would have been pissed after the Great Famine and Cultural Revolution. Basically realizing that the Okhrana were trying genocide against the Chinese people and that they were trying to erase their culture and history. So they would have plenty of motivation to take drastic action to throw them off.

	Some of those charged with enforcing the blockade have come to regret their participation. Wang Junru said he was 15 when the Communists forced him to join a militia for teenagers. Later, he joined 170,000 other soldiers ordered to drive back hungry civilians. “We were told they were the enemy and they had to die,” he said.

	Whatever zeal he had for the revolution was extinguished by the 23 years he spent in a labor camp — punishment, he said, for insulting the relative of a party official when he was a college student. After his release, he spent the rest of his working life hauling logs.

	Now 76 and embittered, he said young people should learn about what happened in Changchun — and during the rest of the civil war. “They only know the propaganda,” he said. “Maybe if they know how horrible war is, they can try to avoid it in the future.”

	``Not allowing the starving city residents to leave and sending other starving citizens back into the city has become difficult to explain to the troops,'' the officer's report says.

	These books are similar to the historical revisionism currently under way in the Soviet Union.

	Between the time the Chinese books were written in the late 1980s and the time they were published, however, China's limited political reforms became a casualty of the 1989 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.

	Although high-ranking military officers criticized the books, they did not stop their own publishing houses from putting them out.


What was going on there? Part of perestroika?

I wonder how much of perestroika was a deception? they can't control everything... how much did they decide on this vs. being forced into it?

Might have wanted to "distance themselves" from the old regime if they realized they couldn't stop this from coming out


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika
	Perestroika and Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms have similar origins but very different effects on their respective countries' economies. Both efforts occurred in large communist countries attempting to modernize their economies, but while China's GDP has grown consistently since the late 1980s (albeit from a much lower level), national GDP in the USSR and in many of its successor states fell precipitously throughout the 1990s.


Seems like they are opportunistic. Be evil when no-one suspects it to grab power, then pretend to reform to show they have "changed" and grab power a different way.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping#Role_in_the_Tiananmen_Square_protests
	On his tour, Deng made various speeches and generated large local support for his reformist platform. He stressed the importance of economic reform in China, and criticized those who were against further reform and opening up. Although there was a debate on whether or not Deng actually said it,[45] his perceived catchphrase, "To get rich is glorious" (致富光荣), unleashed a wave of personal entrepreneurship that continues to drive China's economy today. He stated that the "leftist" elements of Chinese society were much more dangerous than "rightist" ones.

	According to Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, "In 1992 I had unprecedented access to Politburo and Central Committee secret documents which have been classified, and still are even now, for 30 years. These documents show very clearly that the whole idea of turning the European common market into a federal state was agreed between the left-wing parties of Europe and Moscow as a joint project which Gorbachev in 1988–89 called our 'common European home'." (interview by The Brussels Journal, February 23, 2006).

	The Soviets developed a long-range strategy to defeat the West back in the late 1950s based on a Leninist strategy of strategic deception and subterfuge, replete with a planned collapse — including potentially tearing down the Berlin Wall (which Golitsyn first detailed in a 1978 memorandum embedded at the end of this post) — in combination with perestroika and glasnost, words whose true definitions were far different than those the West ascribed to them.

	These moves according to Golitsyn were designed to invite the West’s capital, technology and most of all gullibility/trust to Russia, which it could then use to build itself up, and, while the West moved leftward and intertwined itself inextricably with Russia and other socialist states, “converge” and dominate the West under a world government headed by none other than the Russians and Chinese.

The general pattern of disinformation determines the forms it takes 
and the techniques used. In the facade and strength pattern, 
information damaging to the regime is suppressed and information 
favorable to it is exaggerated. The real issues are reflected vaguely, if 
at all, in the press. Statistics are withheld or inflated. Propaganda 
plays a leading role to the extent that it becomes in itself the main 
form of disinformation. Special deceptions are carried out to support 
the credibility of the propaganda. The failures and weakness of the 
regime are presented as its successes and strengths. Political and 
ideological passivity and retreat are presented as political and 
ideological victories. Concern about the future is presented as 
confidence. The fears of the outside world at communist strength are 
deliberately aroused and the communist threat is exaggerated out of 
proportion to its actual potential in order to discourage external 
intervention in communist affairs. 


Is that going on now? seems like they're losing their grip on China and more and more people know what they're up to and instead they act "loud" and install a babling puppet in the U.S.

"appear to be weak when you are strong, strong when you are weak"

	The serious tensions between the Soviet Union and Communist China, which threatened to create a split between them in 1950-53.

So there was a split then--which exactly was the fake-out?

So he's saying Stalin made everyone realize how awful they were, gave a "bad name" to communism. Could have motivated them ditching it with Perestroika and the "reforms" seen after Stalin on both Russia and China.

Perhaps this might be a persistent problem if you ensure your little club is always ran by brutal sociopaths?

Say, what was the point of Democracy again?

The first hint of the downgrading of Stalin's role and the admission 
of his mistakes was given in July 1953 in a secret party letter to the 
party membership informing them of Beriya's dismissal and the 
reasons for it. It referred to Stalin not as an outstanding leader, but 
simply as "Stalin, 1. V.," and bracketed his name with that of Beriya, 
stating that Stalin's favoritism had prevented Beriya's exposure. It was 
the first tacit admission to the party membership of the fallibility of 
Stalin. 

What's the difference between "the party" and the Okhrana? seems like there is a difference in ideology, what they care about? can't really say

Okhrana likes their conspiracy theories, despotism, law of the jungle, grabbing power

"the party" here might have cared about their country? maybe?

Was there a view of changing their government for the sake of the people or was it always with a mind toward keeping themselves in power?

Golitsyn says most of them were KGB. KGB has strong continuities with Okhrana, so are they basically their successor? what I don't get is the Okhrana seemed international then and as far as I can tell seems that way now. But wouldn't the KGB at least be motivated by a pro-Russian ideology (for most of them anyway I guess)



The strategy of strengthening the communist bloc while presenting 
an appearance of communist disunity is neatly expressed in Sun Tzu's 
aphorisms: 

• All warfare is based on deception. Therefore, when capable, feign 
incapacity; when active, inactivity. 

• Offer the enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him. 

• One who wishes to appear to be weak in order to make his enemy 
arrogant must be extremely strong. Only then can he feign weakness. 



The reasons for genuine splits having been removed, the way was 
open for the creation of spurious splits in accordance with 
Dzerzhinskiy's principle of political prophylaxis; that is, the forestall- 
ing of undesirable developments {such as splits or the growth of 
opposition movements) by deliberately provoking and controlling 
such developments through the use of secret agents, and by guiding 
them in directions that are either harmless or positively useful to the 
regime. 

fuck me I do the same thing...



If Western intelligence services lose their effectiveness and them- 
selves become channels for communist disinformation, this in turn 
damages Western analysis of communist sources and results in failure 
to detect the pattern of communist disinformation and any changes 
there may be in it. When all three factors — Western abihty to obtain 
secret information. Western abihty to interpret communist sources, 
and Western abihty to understand disinformation — are themselves 
adversely affected by the consequences of penetration and 
disinformation, then the whole process of Western assessment 



VULNERABILITY OF WESTERN ASSESSMENTS 67 

of communist affairs is vitiated, and the real problems and real 
changes in the communist world cannot be distinguished from 
fictitious and deceptive ones. Doubtful information from official, 
unofficial, or "secret" communist sources confirms or is confirmed by 
disinformation fed through compromised Western secret sources. 
Information deliberately leaked by the communist side is accepted as 
reliable by the West. Genuine information, fortuitously received by 
the West, may be questioned or rejected. In this way the errors in 
Western assessments become not only serious, but also irreversible 
unless and until the pattern of disinformation is correctly established. 
The critical condition of the assessment process in the West is the 
more serious because it is unrecognized and undiagnosed. If Western 
assessments of the communist world are wrong, then Western 
miscalculations and mistakes in policy will follow. These 
miscalculations and mistakes will be exploited by the communist side 
to their own advantage. When this happens and the Western mistakes 
are recognized by the public, the politicians, diplomats, and scholars 
associated with those mistakes are discredited and a basis is laid for 
the emergence of extremist bodies of opinion. The rise of 
McCarthyism in the United States after the failure of American 
postwar policy in Eastern Europe and China is an obvious example. 


damn I knew it!

would be a problem if intel agencies are fooled in a significant way like that


Similarly, party control over the 
military in China was reaffirmed from 1958 onward. The military 
cannot and do not make policy in either country. The "discovery" by 
Western analysts of a military pressure group in the Soviet Union in 
1960 and the emphasis on the role of the former Chinese minister of 
defense, Lin Piao, were both mistaken. The military leaders, like the 
so-called technocrats, are all party members under the control of the 
party leadership. In their separate fields they are all active participants 
in the implementation of the long-range policy. 


Saying Lin is a soviet agent?


The personality factor in 
the leadership of communist parties took on a new significance. A 
leader's personal style and idiosyncracies no longer determined 
communist policy; on the contrary, the long-range bloc policy began 
to determine the actions of the leaders and to exploit their differences 
in personality and style for its own purposes. Stalin used the cult of 
personality to establish his own personal dictatorship; Mao used it, in 
part, to conceal the reality of collective leadership. Since the adoption 
of the common long-range policy also solved the problem of 
succession, power struggles lost their former significance and became 
part of the calculated and controlled display of difference and disunity 
within the bloc. The existence of genuine groups of Stalinists and 
liberals, hard-liners, and moderates in the Soviet Union is as illusory 
as the existence of pro-Soviet and anti- 


Soviet groups, or groups of conservatives and pragmatists in the 
Chinese leadership. It is true that there have been representatives of 
the older and younger generations in both leaderships, but attempts to 
find differences in the ideology or policy of the different generations 
cannot be substantiated by hard evidence. Both generations in both 
parties were, and are, equally committed to the long-range pohcy of 
1958-60.

Is that what holds them together? their plan for world domination? that actually kindof makes sense in a weird way.

Assuming they are all sociopaths, grabbing power is their favorite thing. So an ambitious plan like that would be attractive to them. And if they had already made progress they wouldn't want to abandon it, like the "sunk cost" fallacy.



When there was a real power struggle in the Soviet Union, it made 
sense to scan the communist press for clues, hints, and significant 
omissions, to read veiled criticism between the lines or to seek 
divergences of emphasis on a given subject in different papers or by 
different leaders in one party or in different parties. It made sense 
particularly in the years before and after Stalin's death. After 1960, 
however, continued analysis on these lines was not only useless but 
positively dangerous, since the bloc's strategists knew all about the 
Borkenau technique and its cliches and used their knowledge in 
planning their strategic disinformation. They knew all the pointers on 
which exponents of the Borkenau method had come to rely for their 
insight into the workings of the communist system; they knew the 
fascination exercised by actual and potential spHts in the communist 
world; they knew when and how to drop hints in the media or in 
private conversation suggesting apparent shifts in the balance between 
apparent rival groups in the leadership; they knew where and how to 
disclose the texts of secret speeches and discussions reflecting 
apparent discord between parties; and, finally, they learned how to 
conduct controlled public polemics between party leaders realistically 
enough to convince the outside world of the reality of Soviet-AI banian 
and Sino-Soviet hostility while at the same time preserving and 
strengthening unity of action within the bloc in accordance with the 
mutually agreed long-range policy and strategy.

The genuine Tito- 
Stalin split was also obviously of prime importance, and it is 
interesting to note how the published texts of the alleged secret party 
letters between the Soviet and Chinese parties recall the genuine party 
letters on the Tito-Stalin split and how the spurious allegations that 
Peng and Lin Piao, both Chinese ministers of defense, were Soviet 
agents echo the well-founded accusation that the Yugoslav chief of 
staff in 1948 was working for the Soviet intelligence service.

Saying Lin Biao wasn't a soviet agent?

So what was going on exactly?

Seems like there were real power struggles? clearly some in China would reset Soviet rule after learning all they had done to them.

But they could also fake and exaggerate a real split. One would think the level of control they would have over China would depend on their level of indoctrination, size and success of their blackmail network, and so on.

In the author's view Khrushchev's was a short-term personal dictatorship

• The condemnation of Stalin's cult of personahty and the practice of 
physically eliminating rivals. 

• The incompatibility between personal dictatorship and the active, 
constructive, and harmonious collaboration of a bloc of communist countries 
in pursuit of a common long-range policy. 

• Mao's voluntary and exemplary decision in 1959 to give up all his 
positions of power except the leadership of the party in order to concentrate 
on problems of long-range policy and communist strategy. 

• The concern of the bloc leaders as a whole to avoid a repetition of the 
painful events after 1924 and 1953. 

• The personal interest of Khrushchev and Mao in avoiding subsequent 
condemnation of their activities resulting from a further power struggle, and 
hence their wilhngness to yield power voluntarily to the party apparatus and 
bureaucracy. 

• The stabihzing effect of the long-range bloc policy. 



Mao voluntarily gave up his positions of power?

dubious


Saying Krushchev wasn't forced out, he chose a successor.

Mao sounds like a moron. A true believer of Communism.

Lenin and Stalin would have known it was a farce.


Would assume they would want someone easy to manipulate to be installed to increase their own power, not an "equal." Their whole schtick was subjigation, fooling people.

	Thus, the Romanian DIE (counterpart of KGB foreign intelligence), which I headed, in 1972 received from the KGB an Arabic translation of the old Russian forgery, “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” We also received "documentary" material in Arabic produced by the Soviet disinformation "proving" America was a Zionist country whose aim was to transform the Islamic world into a Jewish fief.

	The mystery of Lin Biao’s death is comparable to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Qui said.

no kidding!

http://www.auw.edu.bd/library/BkDetailsMain.php?ISBNno=%200-8047-3529-8.&Ano=2336
	In 1971, Lin Biao, Mao Zedong's closest comrade-in-arms and chosen successor, was killed in a mysterious plane crash in Mongolia. This book challenges the official explanation that Lin was fleeing to the Soviet Union after an unsuccessful coup attempt.


http://ww2.odu.edu/ao/instadv/quest/LinBiao.html


https://books.google.com/books?id=Kc5wutpAuHgC&pg=PA68
	In March 1938, a severe injury removed Lin from military duty for several years until he resumed active command in 1942. In the winter of 1939 he went to the Soviet Union for medical treatment, but his stay there is shrouded in mystery; it is not even clear where and for how long Lin stayed in the hospital. Li Tianmin believes that the purpose of Lin's stay in the Soviet Union was not just medical. Ten other military officers accompanied him, most of who stayed at the Frunze Military Academy. Some sources treat Lin as the Chinese representative to the Comintern and as such Mao's personal representative to Stalin. Mao did not trust Wang Ming, through whom the CCP normally communicated with the Soviets.  The only evidence from Soviet sources of Lin's presence is an article in the Communist International in August 1940 by a person named "Ling Pao."

	It is also not clear whether Lin had any contact with Stalin or whether Lin served in the Soviet army against the Nazis while in the Soviet Union. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards reported that Lin had been involved in the Stalingrad Campaign, and that Stalin had been so impressed by Lin's military prowess that he gave Lin his own pistol. This information, however, cannot be considered reliable because of the prevalence of propaganda in China during that period.


	...Apparently, Mao and Wang Ming competed for Lin's support.

	..."I tell you," Mao allegedly said, "I have engaged in military affairs for several years, and my one accomplishment is the training of Lin Biao. He is really my man, and among the units of the Eight Route Army and the New Fourth Army, on the troops commanded by him are the troops I can rely on."


	Communist victories in the civil war were in fact closely associated with Lin Bioa's name. The war gave Lin the opportunity to refine his military techniques, which he had worked on since his early years in the Red Army. In October 1945, Lin led 100,000 troops into northeastern China (Manchuria), which was then strategically important to the Communists for several reasons. It connected the Soviet Union and China and had remained a neutral area after Japanese forces in the region surrendered to Soviet forces in August 1945. If the Communists could occupy the area, they would have a solid base through which to secure aid from the Soviet Union and from which to mount a show of force in dealing with the Guomindang. But the Guomindang also realized the strategic significance of the area, which soon became the locus of a major confrontation.

	Why did Mao choose Lin to command the fight against Guomindang forces in Manchuria? Of the Communist commanders, Lin was one of the most knowledgable in conventional warfare and probably the most successful as well. While in the Soviet Union, he had received training in modern military warfare, and because of his recent stay there would probably be adept in dealing with his Soviet counterparts. But most important, Mao trusted Lin, not only because of Lin's personal loyalty but also because Lin's attitude toward the Soviet Union was, in Mao's eyes, "correct." Lin would never be an "intellectual captive" of the Soviets, as Mao considered Wang and many other returnees from the Soviet Union to be.

	When Lin arrived in the Northeast, Communist forces there were inferior to those of the Guomindang in number and equipment. As a result, in April and May 1947 Lin's forces suffered several setbacks, especially the defeat at Siping, which cost some 40,000 casualties. This was the first major defeat in Lin's career as a military commander. He attributed the loss to his own underestimation of Guomindang forces and to insufficient time to prepare properly. After this loss, careful planning became a hallmark of Lin's military style.

	The turning point for the Communists in the Northeast began in 1948. In November, Lin concentrated his troops along the railway lines from Shenyang to Beijing and launched the Liaoshen campaign. He captured the city of Jinzhou first, then proceeded to Changchun and Shenyang, overcoming strong resistance from Guomindang forces. Within two months, the whole Northeast came under Lin's control.



	...His future seemed bright and assured: he was still young, militarily brilliant, and loyal to Mao.

	After the Communists formed a government in 1949, however, Lin Biao remained out of the national spotlight for several years. He did not participate in the Korean War, explanations for which have prompted controversy among scholars. Even after the Korean War, Lin was invisible until 1956. He was reportedly absent from several important meetings the next year, 1957, including the third meeting of the Chinese People's Political COnsultative Conference in October and the Supreme State Conference in November. He may have been in the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1956 because of poor health.

	The Soviet interragnum, if that is what it was, did not hinder the advancement of Lin's political and military careers. In February 1950, he became chairman of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee, which controlled the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guandong, and Guangxi. Also in the 195s, Lin was one of the ten state council vice-premiers under Zhou Enlai and one of the fifteen vice-chairmen of the newly established National Defense Council in 1954.

	...Lin's political rise was clearly a result of his loyalty to Mao, given his relative inactivity in national affairs in the early 1950s. Lin's loyalty made a deep impression on Mao and allowed him to maintain a special relationship with him. According to Li Yinqiao, Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai were distinct among the military leaders for the frankness in front of Mao. Li remembered Lin's rigid, professional manner when he came to see Mao. Unlike others who may have felt intimidated by Mao, Lin voiced his opinion openly and even argued with Mao.

	...When Mao appointed Lin his successor in 1966, nobody in the leadership questioned the legitimacy of the appointment.


pg 141

	He Zizhen was not of any help to me politically, but Jian Qing could provide help." When He Zizhen left Yanan for the Soviet Union for a rest, Jiang soon became Mao's de facto wife. In 1939, Mao wrote to He Zizhen in Moscow that their marriage was over. Similarly, the marriage between He Long and his first wife, Jian Xianren, ended after he met Xue Ming; he too wrote a letter to from Yanan to his wife in Moscow, declaring that he was divorcing her. According to Harrison Salisbury, divorce was easy in Yanan. All that was needed was a simple statement from the husband.


	...Because of her identity as Mao's ex-wife had a negative impact on Mao's political image, her existence was to be known to as few people as possible. After she left Yanan, she stayed in the Soviet Union until the end of 1946. When she finally returned to China, she had to remain anonymous and was kept under "protection" wherever she went. She was not allowed to visit Beijing until after Mao's death and Jiang Qing's arrest in 1976. She even had trouble seeing her daughter, the only one of her children who survived the harsh war years, but who lived with Mao. He Zizhen lived alone in Shanghai, struggling through a lonely life without family or work. Under such conditions, she could not recover from the emotional problems that began when she was in the Soviet Union in the 1940s and continued for the rest of her life.

	..."Many people believed," stated Wang Xingjuan, "that if He Zizhen had not left Mao, Jiang Qing would not have had the chance to become Mao's wife. Nor would the Cultural Revolution have happened, during which


	...the Party Central Committee considered her unsuitable to be Mao's wife. Because Mao had insisted on marrying her, the committee exacted from her a pledge that se would devote herself to taking care of Mao and not interfere in political affairs for the next 30 years. Thus Jiang was kept out of politics until just before the Cultural Revolution. The highest position she had held until thnen was section chief in charge of artwork in the municipal government of Beijing.

	In the mid-1950s, Jiang seemed to be repeating He Zizhen's tragedy. IN 1956 she almost collapsed physically and mentally and went to the Soviet Union to be treated for cervical cancer. According to Dr. Li, Jiang became hysterical when she learned about her cancer and after she returned became "obsessively hypochondriacal." She often accused her nurses of trying to "poison" her. Dr. Li believed that her condition was the result of a life without meaning and her constant fear of being abandoned by Mao.

	Mao understood Jiang's problem. "What really bothers her is that she is afraid that one day I might not want her anymore," Mao told Dr. Li. "I have told her many times that it is not true and that she should stop worrying about it." Mao's promises did little to reassure Jiang Qing, since she knew Mao had affairs with numerous young women. According to Dr. Li, Mao in his later years did not even bother to hide his affairs from Jiang Qing. Once, Dr. Li caught Jiang crying on a park bench just outside Mao's compound in Zhonganhai. She begged him not to tell anyone and told him that Mao's womanizing was becoming so flagrant that she feared he would eventually abandon her.

	In 1957, Dr. Li reported Jiang's mental condition to Mao and Zhou Enlai. They did nothing about it, however, because, in Deng Yingchao's words, it would have been "fair to the chairman" to say that Comrade Jiang Qing had mental problems since Mao had already suffered so much from the loss of family members Beginning in the late 1950s, Jaing Qing and Mao lived separately. Mao continued his active sex life with numerous female partners, but there was no possibility of Jiang Qing's finding a lover. Even after the Cultural Revolution, when Jiang became notorious throughout China, her biographers found no credible evidence that she had had love affairs with anyone else. According to Dr. Li, to do so would have provided Mao with an excuse to get rid of her. Her fear of abandonment was too strong to give Mao such an opportunity.

	Jiang Qing's devotion to Mao was unquestionable. Even Mao knew this, which was why he constantly defended her during the Cultural Revolution. Most of Mao's criticism of Jiang, which was widely quoted later as proof that Mao had decided to part company with her, was actually prompted by his concern for her future. Although contemporary Chinese writers now typically portray Jiang as a dragon lady who took advantage of her husband's power to play her own political role, Mao probably could not have found a more appropriate wife. Despite all her problems, Jiang remained absolutely loyal to Mao for reasons of her own. Not only was she a help to Mao politically, as Mao himself confirmed, but she finally came to tolerate Mao's frequent affairs and even tried to maintain a civil relationship with the women involved.

	...In the eyes of many Chinese, Ye Qun was also a malicious woman, greedy, capricious, and mean. Some members of Lin Biao's staff, however, described Ye as benign and caring, someting no one has said of Jiang Qong. Ye had more control over Lin than Jiang had over Mao. This was not because Ye had a stronger personality than Jiang, but because Lin was in poor health for much of their marriage and thus more vulnerable and submissive. Few people know for sure what was wrong with Lin, and his medical records have never been released. It is clear, however, that in the later years of his life he was in very fragile physical and mental health. Dr. Li believed Lin suffered from neurasthenia and was a hypochondriac.

	...As early as the 1950s, a Soviet doctor diagnosed Lin's problem as manic depression, but Ye rejected the diagnosis and sent the Soviet specialist back to the Soviet Union.

	...There are numerous incredible stories about Lin Biao's health problems, though they almost certainly contain elements of truth. There is little reason for the authors of the stories to have lied about Lin's health.


	...

	
	In Li's account, he did not realize the Lins were going to "betray the country" until he heard Lin himself ask Liguo on the car on the way to the airport, "How far away would Irkutsk be?" During the next few seconds, Li was torn over what to do. Finally, he realized what was happening; everything Doudou had told him was suddenly clear, and he realized that the group was heading for the Soviet Union. Torn between loyalty to his master and the well-being of his own family, Li asked himself what would happen to his wife and children if he were labeled a traitor to the country. He dared not think along that line.

	The car continued at high speed, approaching Building 58, the office of Unit 8341. By his own account, Li decided to side with his family instead of his master the moment he saw troops lining up beside the road at Building 58. He suddenly ordered the chauffuer to stop the car and jumped out before anyone in the car could stop him. It was at this point that gunshots rang out and Li was wounded. Nobody knows who fired the shots, though some eyewitnesses insist that Li shot himself. Zhang Qinglin, who attended to Li Wenpu on the spot, also insists that Li SHot himself. In any case, the car stopped only for a second and then rushed ahead again.



pg 195


	There is no evidence to support the official claim that Lin had been actively involved in planning a final escape to the Soviet Union. Until 11:00 P.M., Ye was still talking about going to Dalian or Guangzhou the next morning. Lin himself never mentioned anything to anyone about going anywhere besides Dalian. Even Li Wenpu, Lin's trusted bodyguard, believed Lin was going to Dalian or Guangzhou until the car left for the airport around midnight. If he had not, Li would have stayed out of the car rather than getting in and then jumping from it seconds after it started moving. Without Li's help, Lin would not have been able to leave the house. According to Zhang Ning, in the last years of his life, Lin never got into a car without the help of Li Wenpu. Each time before Lin left his residence, Li helped him dress and get ready. It is also said that for security reasons, Lin refused to get into a car if he did not see Li inside. Li's later report to the Special Case Group that Lin had asked in the car about the distance to Irkutsk is the sole piece of evidence indicating that Lin knew they were going to the Soviet Union. There is no other evidence to corroborate Li's testimony on this point. It is difficult to believe that Li could have reached a decision to desert his master of 40 years during the seconds between the car's starting and his jumping out of it.

	There is some evidence that Li testified falsely under pressure from the Special Case Group, which was not uncommon during the investigation of Lin's case. According to Zhang Ning, who was under house arrest with other members of Lin's staff, the Special Case Group had difficulty gathering evidence from Lin's staff about Lin's plotted "escape." The staff of Lin's office were forced to rewrite again and again their reports to the CCP Central Committee exposing Lin's crime according to the guidance given by the Special Case Group.

	When other members of Lin's staff learned that Li had provided the key piece of evidence that Lin intended to betray the country (the question about the distance to Irkutsk) only after being separated from the rest of the group, few professed to believe Li's testimony. Indeed, many believed that Li made up the evidence in exchange for better treatment for himself and his family. If this was his purpose, he achieved it. While most other staff members were expelled from the party, dishonorably discharedfrom the military service, and assigned to places far away from Beijing, Li remained a party member and a military officer, and his family was allowed to stay in Beijing. Years later, when Duoduo finally had a chance to see Li Wenpu, she said that Li seemed apologetic.

	Moreover, there is no reason to assume that e and Liguo would have excluded Li from their plans, if they had any plans at the time. Both of them knew how much Lin trusted Li and that without Lis' cooperation it would have been impossible to get Lin to leave the house. Finally, if Lin himself had had any calculated plan to leave Beidaihe, he would never have left his daughter, Doudou, behind.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Qing

What's her motive?

A true believer in communism sounds like.


Why the Cultural Revolution? She influence Mao there?


	Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7, 1937, and the Japanese invasion of Shanghai which destroyed most of its movie industry, Jiang left her celebrity life on the stage behind. She went first to Xi'an, then to the Chinese Communist headquarters in Yan'an to "join the revolution" and the war to resist the Japanese invasion. In November, she enrolled in the "Counter-Japanese Military and Political University" (Marxist–Leninist Institute) for study. 

more indoctrination?

Lin Biao was president


Why did they want him to make a deal to marry Jaing? weird. Sort of kept it on the dl?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Qing#Death_of_Mao_Zedong


the fuck is going on here


	Jiang Qing showed few signs of sorrow during the days following Mao's death. It was uncertain who controlled the Communist Party's central organs during this transition period. Hua Guofeng, as Mao's designated successor, held the titular power as the acting Chairman of the Communist Party and as Premier. However, Hua was not very influential. Some sources indicate that Mao mentioned Jiang Qing before his death in a note to Hua Guofeng, telling him to "go and consult her" if he runs into problems (Chinese: 有事找江青).[15]


So she tried to grab power in a coup along with GoF after Mao's death?

	Her grave is marked by a tall white stone inscribed with her school name, not the name by which she was famously known, which reads: "Tomb of Late Mother, Li Yunhe, 1914–1991"

When did Li Yunhe die?

Not sure what Kissinger is doing with these.

Didn't he do something similar with Xi?

Does he do this with everybody?



http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/10/books/on-china-by-henry-kissinger-review.html
This sort of pragmatic self-interest on China’s part, Mr. Kissinger says, has continued. After 9/11, he writes: “China remained an agnostic bystander to the American projection of power across the Muslim world and above all to the Bush administration’s proclamation of ambitious goals of democratic transformation. Beijing retained its characteristic willingness to adjust to changes in alignments of power and in the composition of foreign governments without passing a moral judgment.”

Regarding the brutal crackdown on dissidents by the government of Deng Xiaoping at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Mr. Kissinger says that the American reaction left the Chinese puzzled: “They could not understand why the United States took umbrage at an event that had injured no American material interests and for which China claimed no validity outside its own territory.”

For that matter, Mr. Kissinger’s own take on Tiananmen and the Chinese government has a determinedly “on the one hand, on the other hand” feel: “Like most Americans, I was shocked by the way the Tiananmen protest was ended. But unlike most Americans, I had had the opportunity to observe the Herculean task Deng had undertaken for a decade and a half to remold his country: moving Communists toward acceptance of decentralization and reform; traditional Chinese insularity toward modernity and a globalized world — a prospect China had often rejected. And I had witnessed his steady efforts to improve Sino-American ties.”

Mr. Kissinger is even more chillingly cavalier about the tens of millions of people who lost their lives during Mao’s years in power and the devastating fallout of his Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. Mr. Kissinger writes about what he describes as a “poignant” scene in which “Nixon complimented Mao on having transformed an ancient civilization, to which Mao replied: ‘I haven’t been able to change it. I’ve only been able to change a few places in the vicinity of Beijing.’ ”

Mr. Kissinger then, startlingly, adds: “After a lifetime of titanic struggle to uproot Chinese society, there was not a little pathos in Mao’s resigned recognition of the pervasiveness of Chinese culture and the Chinese people.”


I guess Kissinger just wants to be on every powerful person's good side so he can play them off each other?

He's like the opposite of me!


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping
	Although Deng got involved in the Marxist revolutionary movement in China, the historian Mobo Gao has argued that "Deng Xiaoping and many like him [in the Chinese Communist Party] were not really Marxists, but basically revolutionary nationalists who wanted to see China standing on equal terms with the great global powers. They were primarily nationalists and they participated in the Communist revolution because that was the only viable route they could find to Chinese nationalism."


https://www.amazon.com/Battle-Chinas-Past-Cultural-Revolution/dp/074532780X
	Mao and his policies have long been demonised in the West, with the Cultural Revolution considered a fundamental violation of human rights.

	As China embraces capitalism, the Mao era is being surgically denigrated by the Chinese political and intellectual elite. This book tackles the extremely negative depiction of China under Mao in recent publications and argues most people in China, including the rural poor and the urban working class, actually benefited from Mao's policy of a comprehensive welfare system for the urban and basic health and education provision for the rural, which is being reversed in the current rush towards capitalism.

	By a critical analysis of the mainstream account of the Mao era and the Cultural Revolution and by revealing what is offered in the unofficial e-media debates this book sets the record straight, making a convincing argument for the positive effects of Mao's policies on the well-being of the Chinese people. 

???


https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobo_Gao&prev=search
	Mobo Gao became known through his first book, Gao Village: Rural Life in Modern China , published in 1999. "This remarkable book , " says John Gittings, The Guardian's correspondent for the Far East, "takes us to Heart of rural China as had never been done before. " For this journalist, the metamorphosis of the young peasant Mobo Gao into a university professor abroad gives him a unique perspective. The changes in his village were much more complex than the modern Chinese historiography suggests. The book shows that the cultural revolution had positive aspects and that the reforms conducted since then have had mixed results. The life described is that of a village where the bonds of the clan are strong and where the only way out is to become a migrant worker. Mobo Gao is also the author of The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution , a book published in 2008.

	British journalist Michael Rank , in an article in the Guardian 15 , notes that Mobo Gao seems to imply that the anger of Chinese peasants against the post-Mao Zedong reforms exempts the chaos of the cultural revolution. He finds Mobo Gao virulent when he writes that Mao 's adulatory critics . The unknown story of Jung Chang and Jon Halliday is an "intellectual scandal" 16 , which he repeated in Was Mao Really a Monster? And which Charles W. Hayford describes as controversial 17 . For Rank, Mobo Gao's personal attacks on Jung Chang have become embarrassing, and his defense of the cultural revolution has not convinced him. Mobo Gao cites a Red Guard document prohibiting the victimization of the children of senior officials, whereas in fact they have been terribly persecuted. 16 The fact that 542 titles of journals were published during this period is hardly evidence of intense political debate, he adds, as they were all forced to follow the party line. Rank, however, believes that Gao is right to highlight the current inequalities and finds that his comments on Mao give ample food for thought 16

So Mobo say Mao not so bad, attacks Jung? weird. What's his deal?


http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/subject/mobo-gao

Either way he sounds like a communist, but then says Deng Xiaoping isn't really that communist. Why?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping
	After leaving the army of Feng Yuxiang in the northwest, Deng ended up in the city of Wuhan, where the Communists at that time had their headquarters. At that time, he began using the nickname "Xiaoping" and occupied prominent positions in the party apparatus. He participated in the historic emergency session on 7 August 1927 in which, by Soviet instruction, the Party dismissed its founder Chen Duxiu, and Qu Qiubai became the secretary general. In Wuhan, Deng first established contact with Mao Zedong, who was then little valued by militant pro-Soviet leaders of the party.

	Between 1927 and 1929, Deng lived in Shanghai, where he helped organize protests that would be harshly persecuted by the Kuomintang authorities. The death of many Communist militants in those years led to a decrease in the number of members of the Communist Party, which enabled Deng to quickly move up the ranks. During this stage in Shanghai, Deng married a woman he met in Moscow, Zhang Xiyuan.


Deng sounds like one of them?

	Deng stayed for most of the conflict with the Japanese in the war front in the area bordering the provinces of Shanxi, Henan and Hebei, then traveled several times to the city of Yan'an, where Mao had established the basis for Communist Party leadership. In one of his trips to Yan'an in 1939, he married, for the third and last time in his life, Zhuo Lin, a young native of Kunming, who, like other young idealists of the time, had traveled to Yan'an to join the Communists.


He was pretty old too

Are they dying off? they almost sounded like they were desperate to recruit

Would be a problem if most of your members are motivated by blackmail...


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu_Shunzhang

Defected, led to thousands of communist dying, then secretly organized a "new communist party" anyway?



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_571
	Following Lin's death in 1971, the Chinese government initially charged Lin Biao with personally planning Project 571. After the testimony of Li Weixin (the only one of the alleged plotters to have survived 1971), and the 1980 testimony of General Huang Yongsheng (a former military chief-of-staff whose role in the plot was implied by the testimony of Li Weixin), sources within China have generally come to recognize that Lin Liguo devised the plot independently of Lin Biao. Western scholars have been critical of the Chinese government's perspective since 1971, and generally state that Lin Liguo was the author of the plot.[4] Some Western historians question whether Lin Biao was even aware of Lin Liguo's plans at all.[5]

??? Is all this to throw shade on the idea that Lin Biao was a soviet spy?


Clearly would create problems for them if it turned out they were also responsible for the Siege of Changchung

THen again at this point it looks like they were orchestrating a lot in China...


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Liguo
	However, according to the historian J. D. Spence, "this story is essentially beyond verification, since the photographs later released by the Chinese authorities are of dubious authenticity and details on Lin Biao’s exact plans and on the other plotters are blurred".


Mostly seems like their argument is "the Communist party said it thereore it must be false"

	According to Li Wenpu, Lin Biao's secretary in charge of Lin's security, all Lin's "secret telephones" were installed, and wiretapped, by the CGO. This explains why both Lin Biao and Zhou Enlai were extremely careful when dealing with Wang Dongxing.

	...According to Li Wenpu, Lin Biao's cheif bodyguard, the two encrypted telephones in Lin Biao's residence were installed and administered by the CGO and the communication section of the PLA General Staff Department. See Li Wenpu, "Lin Biao weishzhag Li Wenpu Bbude Bushuo" [Lin Bia's cheif bodyguard Li Wenpu has to say], in Zhonghua ernu [Journal of Chinese people], no 2, (1999), pp. 10-21

Moreover, all security guards who
protected and monitored high-ranking party members were rotated at regular
intervals to prevent them from establishing personal relationships with the
leaders. Li Wenpu was assigned by the CGB and Unit 8341 to guard Lin Biao
after Lin Biao officially became Mao’s successor in the Eleventh Plenum held
in August 1966. Lin was previously guarded by the CMC General Office but
now the CGB and Unit 8341 were also involved in Lin’s security. Because of
Li’s background as a guard from Unit 8341, Ye Qun, Lin’s wife and Director
of Lin Biao Office, treated Li extremely carefully. 27
At the dawn of the Cultural Revolution, personal security guards arrested
their leaders in their homes on the orders of Wang Dongxing; the arrested
leaders included Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Peng Zhen. Among the per-
sonal security guards, anyone who showed sympathy toward those who they
guarded were immediately relieved of their posts. In this system, everyone was
monitored to such an extent that high-ranking officials were even fearful of
crying in their own homes after the Red Guard had begun its campaign, out
of concern that their guards, secretaries, nannies, or even their own children
might report their weeping to the party organizations or the mass rebels. 28
To the CCP security apparatuses, anything that indicated less than 100 per-
cent support and fervor for the Cultural Revolution was considered a sign
of hostility toward the “revolutionary mass movement.” Ye Jianying turned
on the radio in his home to prevent others from listening in when he had
important conversations with others. 29 After Wang Dongxing replaced Yang
Shangkun as head of the Central General Office in December 1965 and the
Chinese People’s Public Security Forces were abolished in June 1966, follow-
ing the purge of Luo Ruiqing, complete control of the security forces fell to
Wang Dongxing. At that time, Wang became the most powerful figure in the
CCP security apparatus.



...


Also,
bodyguards, except the chief bodyguard, were not allowed to carry guns while
serving top leaders. 32 The armed security guards in charge of providing secu-
rity in areas such as the residential compounds of top leaders, offices, facilities,
conference halls, and important events were sent by Unit 8341. As for the seven
top leaders (Mao, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Lin Biao, and
Deng Xiaoping), each was guarded by a company (later called a detachment)
in which the internal-security squad, which comprised about ten soldiers, had
direct access to the top leaders. 33 Two types of secretaries, personal and con-
fidential, served top leaders and were in charge of preparing documents for
leaders’ attendance of the Politburo meetings and of communicating informa-
tion to other top leaders. In addition, the leaders could temporarily call on the
personnel of the party’s think tank as their secretaries. For instance, Mao did
this when he appointed Chen Boda and Hu Qiaomu as his political secretaries
to help him draft party documents and important speeches. 3


...


Evidence shows that Lin Biao’s
every action was monitored by the Central Guard Bureau and the Central Gen-
eral Office, headed by Wang Dongxing.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Biao
	The exact circumstances surrounding Lin's death remain unclear, due to a lack of surviving evidence. Many of the original government records relevant to Lin's death were secretly and intentionally destroyed, with the approval of the Politburo, during the brief period of Hua Guofeng's interregnum in the late 1970s. Among the records destroyed were telephone records, meeting minutes, personal notes, and desk diaries. The records, if they had survived, would have clarified the activities of Mao, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Qing, and Wang Dongxing relative to Lin, before and after Lin's death.[6] Because of the destruction of government documentation related to Lin's death, the Chinese government has relied on alleged confessions of purged officials close to Lin to corroborate the official narrative, but non-Chinese scholars generally regard these confessions as unreliable.

	Mr. Brezhnev: The entire trend of Chinese policies is directed toward ranging the United States against the Soviet Union and is aimed at our becoming involved in confrontation with one another. I recall a slogan uttered by Mao here in Moscow the last time he was here for an international conference. [Quoting the Chinese saying] "I sit on the mountain and watch two tigers fighting."

	That is the precise policy the Chinese are pursing. They are claiming to play a dominant role in world politics. But there are various slogans the Chinese use to justify their position, such as their slogan about the world village against the world city.

	Dr. Kissinger: That was Lin Piao.

	...

	Dr. Kissinger: The rest is yours.

	Mr. Brezhnev: We had treated Lin Piao earlier when he came to Moscow for medical treatment; we have documents in the files; X-rays of his teeth, etc. It is confirmed definitely that the body is Lin Piao's, probably together with some members of his family. It proves beyond a doubt that Lin Piao was on the plane that crashed. Some in China now try to spread incorrecr versions of what was supposed to happen. THe crash was a fact and so was Lin Piao's presence.

	I mention this to show that there is a very serious internal dissension in China. It is still a country with an unstable internal situation. THere is a need for us to follow closely the events in China, both the domestic situation and the foreign policy. But we are at the same time endeavoring to pursure principle, to follow a policy aimed at friendship with the Chinese people.

"I think he must. The August First Appeal was written 
hy Wang Ming. In the beginning of .Tune 1935, on the 
day he returned to Moscow after a vacation and treat- 
ment in Kislovodsk, he said to the comrades who had 
come to sec him: 'The Japanese aggression in North 
China is expanding. The situation is tense. At the sana- 
torium in Kislovodsk T came to the conclusion that there 
must be a new document in the name of the CG CPC, 
in order to promote the united national anti-Japanese 
front policy.' On the following day he bogan writing the 
Appeal to All Compatriots Concerning Resistance to Japan 
and Salvation of the Homeland, which later came to be 
known as the August First Appeal. For three days in 
succession he worked on it until three in the morning, 
and on the fourth day added finishing touches. On the 
fifth day, a meeting of the CPC Comintern delegation 
was called to discuss the draft. The discussion continued 
for several days, with Wang Ming making a report on 
the draft, and then also the concluding remarks. A few 
comrades present in this hall took part in the meeting." 

Wait this is Wang Ming

seems like a lot needed "treatment" in the Soviet Union though?

CIA report on Lin Biao, character, relationship with Mao. Approved for Release 12/99

Loyal to Mao, purged leading up to Cultural Revolution and acted with Madame Mao to purge "half the central military leadership and many regional and provincial leaders" during the Cultural Revolution

Despite his "obligations to and good relations with the Russians in the years 1938-1942", Lin immediately thereafter supported Mao against the Soviet-oriented Chinese leaders, and since 1959 has stood firm with Mao on the entire range of the issues in dispute with Moscow.

..."They appear to hate him almost as much as they do Mao"

	Lin's own definition of his relationship with Mao is so extreme that it has sometimes been regarded as a hoax, a cynical exploitation of the old man's insatiable vanity. For more than 25 years Lin has been upholding Mao's "thought" and urging absolute faith in Mao, and in recent years he has praised Mao--in terms reminiscent of Stalin's sycophants--as always correct, the greatest of all Communists, the supreme genius, the source of all light, the answer to every problem.


pg 8.

Mao assigning Lin to handle work in Cultural Revolution

	Although Mao is unstable, he will probably not change his mind about Lin.

pg 9.

Mao's ideas and cultural revolution loopy

pg 10.

Mao's directives not always clear (didn't Lin position himself as the one to "interpret" them?)


pg 13.

	The evidence, in sum, is that Lin is waht Mao believes him to be--a reliable "revolutionary success" who will do his best to carry on along Mao's lines. The evidence is not absolutely conclusive, because Lin has never operated apart from Mao, but what evidence we have points that way. To conclude otherwise would be to judge that Lin for 35 years has been engaged in a complete deception.


pg 14.


Lin Mao's "man" from the "moment of meeting him." Supported him in power struggle where he came out on top as leader.

got along "very well" with the Russians, then supported Mao in a purge of officials who were "closer to Moscow than Mao was"

pg 16.

	Early in 1960 Lin instructed the PLA to memorize the most important passages in Mao's works, "even though you do not understand them." (Lin was later, during the Cultural Revolution, to issue a similar order with respect to Mao's directives.)


	...Inter alia, Lin endorsed the "paper tiger" concept--that the West would be afraid to use its nuclear weapons and therefore could be aggressively opposed--that the West would be afraid to use its nuclear weapons and therefore could be aggresively opposed--and the concomitant article of faith that the Communists could attain power in many countries through "people's wars" of the Chinese type.


pg 17.

	And in 1961, Lin himself showed an ability to take sensible steps to enhance the regime's military-preparedness and to restore PLA morale--such measures as giving priority to military training over non-military activities, increasing army rations, and improving the lot of servicemen's families. Such adjustments to reality led some observes to think of Lin as a "pragmatic" leader.


pg 19.

	In Janurary 1966 Lin again told the PLA that Mao's works were supreme directives and that "everything he says is the truth." In February Lin began what was to be an ambivalent and difficult relationship with Madame Mao as another watchdog over the PLA. He invited the militant Madame to pepare a reationale for a purge of the PLA. In the same month, according to Lin himself, he moved troops into Peking to frustrate the plans of suspected conspirators. Throughout March and April, Lin wrote and spoke on the need for an ideological revolution; in May, Mao in a letter to Lin ordered the PLA to "play a very great role" in this revolution, and revealed his concept of the new Chinese man as an omincompetent worker-peasent-solider. Also in May Lin made the key speech at a party conference which official launched the Cultural Revolution and confirmed that a purge of the party and of the PLA was underway. Describing Mao as the greatest of all Communists, the man who "always understands" and is always right, Lin again threatened Mao's opponents, many of whom he knew to be present.


pg 20.

Lin saying he himself cannot comprehend Mao's "great thought," and sometimes makes "mistakes" but will "correct" them. Maybe some license for him to "interpret" for Mao?


	...This line soon appeared in simplified form as an exhortation to the PLA--to carry out Mao's policies "whether we understand them or not"


Generally seems to be doing a lot of the important speeches for the cultural revolution, "militant" in telling "revolutionary young" to use Mao's thought as their guide and attack the party apparatus, "discover Mao's opponents" and strike them down.

pg 21.

	By mid-September, Lin was telling military audiences that Mao's works should constitute "99 percent" of Communist classics, and that Mao was the world's "supreme genius" and the greatest man known to history.

	In October 1966, Lin made further preparations for a large-scale purge of the PLA. A MAC directive ordered PLA cadres who encountered statements or actions opposing Mao's thought to report the event to higher levels, no matter how highly-placed the offender was. At the same time, a special group was set up to conduct this purge, and Lin--again to please Mao--named or accepted Madame Mao as the dominant figure of this group. Lin at this time praised the accomplishments of the Cultural Revolution in intensifying Mao-study, exposing Mao's opponents, revolutionizing Chinese society on Mao's lines, and producing reliable "revolutionary successors."


	...In November, the militant Madame Mao began to question whether Lin's PLA was "loyal" to Mao, and Lin allowed her to take the public lead at this time in purging the PLA. She began by attacking LIn's senior deputy on the MAC, and Lin soon joined in. In the next few weeks Lin and the Madame purged several high-ranking officers of the central military leaderhips--including the cheif of the PLA"s special group for the conduct of the purge--and several of the top officers of the regional military commands.


pg 22

	By March, it was evident to Mao and Lin that the PLA had not, in general, acted as a revolutionary force. Lin himself apparently went on an inspection tour in March, and concluded that the PLA was mishandling the young revolutionaries. In late March he again told military audiences that great disorder was necessary to bring down Mao's opponents and produce reliable "successors," and that authority was being withdrawn from the PLA; units were to act only on orders from above. This was the first of several times in the Cultural Revolution that LIn was to rebuke and restrict the PLA for taking conservative positions.

	Lin at this time first expressed displeasure with compilations of passages from his speeches on the ground that they falsely gave an impression that he had a body of thought apart from Mao's. He also admitted that his health was bad and that neurological damage restricted his activity. Peking no longer admits this.

	pg 24.

	The Wuhan commander refused to accept instructions sent by Madame Mao and permitted certain mass organizations to beat and detain members of the delegation.


	...As mass violence rapidly increased, Mao and Lin were forced to retreat. That is, they were forced to recognize again their dependence on the PLA; and they took measures calculated to please military leaders. They dropped Madame Mao--the worst friend of the PLA--from the special group conducting the "revolution" in the PLA.

	pg 25.

	By November, however, Mao had begun to worry again--as in spring 1967--about the fate of his young revolutionaries, and Madame Mao made two speeches which were taken, not unreasonably, as justifying a resumption of violence and of attacks on the PLA.


	...In a case which is still puzzling, Yang Cheng-wu, Lin's chief-of-staff and the MAC-level supervisor of all political security organs in the PLA, was suddenly purged as a "rightist." The immediate cause of his fall was allegedly his effort to arrest some unkown persons whom Madame Mao put under he protection. Lin was again quick to throw his old comrades and proteges to the wolves when they had come into Mao's disfavor. Despite the overwhelming record of his fidelity to Mao and of Mao's confidence in him, Lin may have been worried about his own position. In the late March meeting which surfaced the affair, Lin dissociated himself from Yang and was obsequiously deferential to Madame Mao. Yang was replaced by another longtime protege of Lin's who, although representative of conservative military men, was regarded by both Mao and Lin as loyal.

	Following the purge of Yang and two other senior officers charged as confederates, Lin was prominent in the new offensive against the "rightists." With Madame Mao and others, he sharply criticized certain military leaders for conservative attitudes toward mass organizations.

	The Soviets, it turned out, had extensive medical and dental records on Lin from a 1938-41 stay in Moscow, when he received treatment. Pulling out a sheaf of grisly photographs and materials, Tomilin detailed how he had matched wartime wounds to Lin's head, documented in the old Soviet medical records and in rare photographs, with grooves in the skull found at the crash site.

	Tomilin said the Soviets carted the heads of Lin and his wife back to Moscow, where in all likelihood they are stored in a KGB vault.

Mao unkown story

MAD'S KEY ACCOMPLICE in preventing Wang Ming from making it
to Moscow was, once again, Chou En-lai, his liaison in Chongqing.
Chiang Kai-shek's permission was needed for Russian planes to come to
Yenan, so Mao hypocritically asked Chou to obtain permission from
Chiang for a Russian plane to come and collect Wang Ming, while making
it clear to Chou that he did not want Wang Ming to leave. Chou duly told
the Russians that "the Nationalists would not allow cde. Wang Ming to
leave Yenan." In fact, Lin Biao, who was in Chongqing at the time, told
Soviet ambassador Panyushkin that Chou never raised the issue with the
Nationalists, because of "instructions" from "Yenan."
At this very time, Chou got Chiang's clearance for a Russian plane to
bring Mao's son An-ying back from Russia. An-ying, who had been in
Russia since 1937, was now a twenty-one-year-old gung-ho enthusiast at a
military academy where he had joined the Soviet Communist Party He
had written three letters to Stalin asking to be assigned to the German

	Whatever the prospect for Mao personally, the prospect for China is continued instability. So long as Mao dominates the leadership, he will continue to work * toward fantastic goals through irrational and often con- flicting policies, and he will continue to purge those who cannot work this way. The new revolutionary commit- tees reflect Mao himself: they are inherently unstable, and conflict among their elements will continue. More- over, in building the new party apparatus there may be a destructive conflict within the camp of the militants: the leaders of the central CRG, including Madame Mao, will probably seek to put their own followers in key party posts, while Lin Pia0 may want to install military leaders in these party posts concurrently.

He told some that An Ziwen had supposedly compiled the list at Mao Zedong's instruction to bypass the Politburo and told others that Liu Shaoqi had compiled the list and that a number of deserving people were not on the list, for example, Lin Biao, at a time that Bo Yibo was on the list, etc

	An associate professor at Kent State University in Ohio is being investigated by the FBI for possibly supporting the Islamic State, according to school officials. 

	The probe was revealed by a student newspaper after its editor was interviewed by the FBI as part of its probe into professor Julio Pino. 

	An unknown FBI agent told KentWired.com that a joint terrorism task force has been investigating the history professor for the last year and a half and said there is no direct threat to the university. 

	The agent said the FBI had interviewed several faculty members and more than 20 of Mr. Pino’s students. He is also being investigated for allegedly recruiting students to join the Islamic State, according to KentWired.com.

	Lin, like most of the Politburo, initially held serious reservations about China's entry into the Korean War, citing the devastation that would result if the "imperialists" detonated an atomic bomb in Korea or China. Lin later declined to lead forces in Korea, citing his ill health. In early October 1950, Peng Dehuai was named commander of the Chinese forces bound for Korea, and Lin went to the Soviet Union for medical treatment. Lin flew to the Soviet Union with Zhou Enlai and participated in negotiations with Joseph Stalin concerning Soviet support for China's intervention, indicating that Mao retained his trust in Lin.

	Lin and his closest proteges began as early as January 1971 to plan a military "coup" of some kind against Mao. It is apparent from subequent developments that they agian overestimated their own streng and underestimated Mao's. But they reportedly believed that they had to act in any case, as they themselves would otherwise be purged. It is also credible, 'as further alleged, that a plan to assassinate Mao if necessary was included in the original plans of Lin's group -- as a living Mao could be expected to be too formidable an opponent in a showdown.


pg 11

	It seems likely that by June 1971 Mao had an additional reason to purge Lin's group: namely, its opposition to the Mao-Chou foreign policy, in particular to the plans for President Nixon's visit, an initiative to which Mao and Chou were strongly committed.

	Trofim Denisovich Lysenko (1889-1976) was a Ukrainian born agronomist, a peasant with little education who would likely have toiled in obscurity all his life had he been born in a different place or time. At the age of twenty-nine, while working at a small experiment station in Azerbaijan in 1927, he managed to attract the attention of a Pravda reporter with claims that he had "solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals."

	As told by David Joravsky in The Lysenko Affair, the reporter "confessed that he stared at Lysenko's notebook with ignorant awe. He did not understand the 'scientific laws' by which the barefoot scientists had quickly solved his problem, without trial and error." ("Barefoot" is a peculiarly Russian term to connote peasantry.) Nevertheless, this complete incomprehension didn't stop him from reporting breathlessly in the pages of Pravda that this brilliant young man had proved that a winter crop of peas could be grown in Azerbaijan, "turning the barren fields of the Transcaucasus green in winter, so that cattle will not perish from poor feeding, and the peasant Turk will live through the winter without trembling for tomorrow."


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko
	It was Vavilov who initially supported Lysenko and encouraged him on his work. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Vavilov
	Vavilov was obsessed from an early age with ending famine in both his native Russia and the world.

sad... was he honest or was he one of their agents? Lysenko a witting agent or a useful idiot?

	It was not until later when he was under pressure from the Soviet State that Vavilov began to criticize the non-Mendelian concepts of Trofim Lysenko, who won the support of Joseph Stalin. As a result, Vavilov was arrested on August 6, 1940, while on an expedition to Ukraine. He was sentenced to death in July 1941. In 1942 his sentence was commuted to twenty years' imprisonment; he died in prison in 1943,[11] of starvation.

Sounds like an agent? knew too much?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko
	Another of Lysenko's theories was that obtaining more milk from cows did not depend on their genetics, but on how they were treated. The better they were handled and taken care of, the more milk would be obtained. Given that belief, Lysenko and his followers were well known for taking very good care of their livestock

Deliberate? a way to have livestock eat too many crops

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Lepeshinskaya_%28biologist%29
	Olga Borisovna Lepeshinskaya (Russian: Ольга Борисовна Лепешинская) born as Protopopova (Russian: Протопопова) (August 18, 1871 – October 2, 1963), was a Soviet biologist, a personal protegée of Vladimir Lenin, later Joseph Stalin, Trofim Lysenko and Alexander Oparin. She rejected genetics and was an advocate of spontaneous generation of life from inanimate matter.

	...Lepeshinskaya was a participant in the October Revolution. 

	...Further, she espoused spontaneous generation and the presence of a "vital substance".[2] These claims were propagated as official dogma in the Soviet Union.[1] A claim that soda baths fostered rejuvenation led to a temporary shortage of baking soda.[2] She based her career on claims to observe de novo emergence of living cells from non-cellular materials, supporting such claims by fabricated proofs which were "confirmed" by others eager to advance in the politicized scientific system. Actually, she filmed the death and subsequent decomposition of cells, then projected these films reversed.

why? attacking their own people? they did purges but this is indiscriminate

maybe a cover to convince the rest of the world that that Soviets were just crazy and actually believed this?

What she does sounds like active measures. So they might have figured they could use pseudoscience to attack others? but it would be suspicious if the Soviets didn't act like the believed at least some of their psuedoscience

	In May 22–24, 1950 at the special symposium "Live Matter and Cell Development" for the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences that was supported by Stalin and chaired by Alexander Oparin, Lepeshinskaya gave the keynote speech, and her "discoveries" were celebrated as revolutionary by the invited audience.[1][2] She was the recipient of the Stalin Prize for that year, and her ideas became mandatory instruction in biology.

seems weird... did they just not want the rest of the world to have scientific advancement? could make sense I guess from their perspective, they are a secretive organization and they derive power from secrets. So to their benefit they would want themselves to know everything and the rest of the world to be in the dark.

Killing scientists?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Lepeshinskaya_%28biologist%29
	While her impact and dogmatic dominance have parallels to those of Lysenko, her claims were never officially renounced but just faded away.

	She involved her daughter Olga and her son-in-law Vladimir Kryukov in her work; in contrast, her husband, Panteleimon Lepechinsky, thought little of it. "Don’t you listen to her. She’s totally ignorant about science and everything she’s been saying is a lot of rubbish" he told a visitor.

	The Disgraceful Episode Of Lysenkoism Brings Us Global Warming Theory

	Peter Ferrara 

	Lysenkoism was “politically correct” (a term invented by Lenin) because it was consistent with certain broader Marxist doctrines.  Marxists wanted to believe that heredity had a limited role even among humans, and that human characteristics changed by living under socialism would be inherited by subsequent generations of humans.  Thus would be created the selfless new Soviet man.

	Also Lysenko himself arose from a peasant background and developed his theories from practical applications rather than controlled scientific experiments.  This fit the Marxist propaganda of the time holding that brilliant industrial innovations would arise from the working classes through practical applications.  Lysenko’s theories also seemed to address in a quick and timely manner the widespread Soviet famines of the time arising from the forced collectivization of agriculture, rather than the much slower changes from scientific experimentation and genetic heredity.

	...Those who promote the theory are favored with billions from government grants and neo-Marxist environmentalist largesse, and official recognition and award.  Faked and tampered data and evidence has arisen in favor of the politically correct theory.  Is not man-caused, catastrophic global warming now the only theory allowed to be taught in schools in the West?

	Those in positions of scientific authority in the West who have collaborated with this new Lysenkoism because they felt they must be politically correct, and/or because of the money, publicity, and recognition to be gained, have disgraced themselves and the integrity of their institutions, organizations and publications.

Sounds like one of them. Trying to paint Lysenkoism as "just marxists going crazy"

	Remember Lysenkoism (e.g., pseudoscience to promote a socialist agenda) still exists today, particularly in America were the Democrat Socialist Party mandates a militant Evolution Atheist agenda which includes obeisance to the Cult of Climate Change. All ‘climate change deniers’ will be severely punished by the Socialist State by destroying their careers and by ignoring their writings exposing socialism slavery. The Obama administration is very expert in punishing Climate Change deniers.

	Likewise Savage writes, “In the Soviet Union under Stalin, people were forbidden to believe that genes exist, just like people in Obama’s America are forbidden to believe that man-made climate change doesn’t exist.” “Marxists have to stamp out the truth or no one would tolerate their rule,” Savage writes. “That’s why Stalin needed a fake scientist to push Lysenkoism in the USSR and why Obama needs fake scientists to push global warming in the USSA.”


	...Lysenkoism caused the Ukrainian Famines

	Later Savage proposes an interest Socratic dialectical question: “Are you looking forward to Obamacare, which is Stalin-care in drag? You think government will give you better doctors, shorter wait times, or lower costs? The Russians did. That’s why thirty million Russians starved to death as a direct result of collective farming and other idiotic socialist ideas.”



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko
	Lysenko with his ideas of farming practices that would yield better crops, encouraged more farmers to return to working their lands. This also impressed Stalin and was what really caught his eye. 

Something off about this?

http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5926.html
	Nikolai Krementsov argues that the model of Stalinist science, already taking hold during the thirties, was reversed by the need for inter-Allied cooperation during World War II. Science, as a tool for winning the war and as a diplomatic and propaganda instrument, began to enjoy higher status, better funding, and relative autonomy. Even the reinstated Science Department within the Central Committee was staffed by a leading geneticist and others sympathetic to conventional science. However, the onset of the Cold War led to a campaign for eliminating such servility to the West. Then the Western links that had benefited genetics and other sciences during the war and through 1946 became a liability, and were used by Lysenko and others to turn back to the repressive past and to delegitimate whole research directions.

not sure what this is saying?

How "Lysenkoism" was spread


On Lysenkoism:

http://www.v-weiss.de/lysenkoism.html
	The importance of the 1948 session of the Lenin Pansoviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Moscow is widely known to historians of science (Belardelli 1977).  It was at this meeting that Lysenko and his roughly 700 supporters and claqeurs were given the authority by the Communist Party to destroy the study of genetics throughout Communist-dominated East Europe and Siberia, denouncing true genetics as reactionary “Mendelism-Morganism”. The gathering ended with a final address of salutation to comrade Stalin. In the ensuing campaign some 200 Soviet geneticists lost their lives under extraordinary circumstances (Medvedev 1969).

	The original proceedings of this ill-famed session (see English translation 1951) were coedited by I. I. Prezent and V. N. Stoletov, both active participants in the conference who presented their own papers immediately before the concluding address – which was made by T.D. Lysenko himself. Stoletov declared:

	...To my knowledge, this paper is the first which has ever dared to disentangle his background.

So Stoletov is a shady figure in all this


	Lysenko told us that from the works of our teachers of Marxism-Leninism we cannot only deduce the general guiding ideas for studying the variability of inheritance, but also concrete hints concerning the origin of such modifications. …  The experiments of the followers of Michurin show in a convincing way that there is no Mendelian segregation. The inapplicability of the Mendelian rules can even be proven by experiments with Drosophila. … No maneuver of the Mendelists is able to rescue the unfertile unscientific theory of chromosomes from complete unmasking. … From the point of view of practical utility Mendelism was a vacuum in the past, is a vacuum in the present and obviously will be a vacuum in the future.


	...In the Soviet Union, the suppression of both genetics and of mental testing began simultaneously in 1936. In 1951, V. N. Stoletov, one of the most fervent partisans of Lysenko, became Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union and served in similar positions for more than 25 years


	W. Hollitscher, a fierce former partisan of Lysenko

	...Weiss and his manuscript were not attacked by name, but by argument, and the aggressivity of this article, reviving the nightmare of Lysenkoism, was interpreted by a large number of specialists as a threat to rational science as a whole. Therefore, for October 6, 1981, both the president of the Academy of Sciences of East Germany and the President of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences sent invitations to well-known specialists in the fields of genetics, human genetics, neurobiology, ethology, psychology, pedagogics and even philosophy and sociology to attend a full-day seminar. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkmar_Weiss
author seems sketchy


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism
	Isaak Izrailevich Prezent, a main Lysenko theorist, presented Lysenko in Soviet mass-media as a genius who had developed a new, revolutionary agricultural technique. In this period, Soviet propaganda often focused on inspirational stories of peasants who, through their own canny ability and intelligence, came up with solutions to practical problems. Lysenko's widespread popularity provided him a platform to denounce theoretical genetics and to promote his own agricultural practices. He was, in turn, supported by the Soviet propaganda machine, which overstated his successes and omitted mention of his failures. This was accompanied by fake experimental data supporting Lysenkoism from scientists seeking favor and the destruction of counter-evidence to Lysenko's theories. Instead of performing controlled experiments, Lysenko claimed that vernalization increased wheat yields by 15%, solely based upon questionnaires taken of farmers.


	...Whenever the Party announced plans to plant a new crop or cultivate a new area, Lysenko had immediate practical suggestions on how to proceed.

	...So quickly did he develop his prescriptions—from the cold treatment of grain, to the plucking of leaves from cotton plants, to the cluster planting of trees, to unusual fertilizer mixes—that academic biologists did not have time to demonstrate that one technique was valueless or harmful before a new one was adopted. The Party-controlled newspapers applauded Lysenko's "practical" efforts and questioned the motives of his critics. Lysenko's "revolution in agriculture" had a powerful propaganda advantage over the academics, who urged the patience and observation required for science.

	...Support from Joseph Stalin gave Lysenko even more momentum and popularity. In 1935, Lysenko compared his opponents in biology to the peasants who still resisted the Soviet government's collectivization strategy, saying that by opposing his theories the traditional geneticists were setting themselves against Marxism. Stalin was in the audience when this speech was made, and he was the first one to stand and applaud, calling out "Bravo, Comrade Lysenko. Bravo." This event emboldened Lysenko and gave him and his ally Prezent free rein to slander the geneticists who still spoke out against him. Many of Lysenkoism's opponents, such as his former mentor Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov, were imprisoned or even executed because of Lysenko's and Prezent's denunciations.

	...On August 7, 1948, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as "the only correct theory". Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko's research.[7] Criticism of Lysenko was denounced as "bourgeois" or "fascist", and analogous "non-bourgeois" theories also flourished in other fields in the Soviet academy at this time (see Japhetic theory; socialist realism). Interestingly, perhaps the only opponents of Lysenkoism during Stalin's lifetime to escape liquidation came from the small community of Soviet nuclear physicists: as Tony Judt has observed, "It is significant that Stalin left his nuclear physicists alone and never presumed to second guess their calculations. Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid."

	...Lysenkoism dominated Chinese science from 1948 until 1956, 

Poland, Czechoslovokia, and China adopt Lysenkoism

	Nikita Khrushchev, who claimed to be an expert in agricultural science,[citation needed] also valued Lysenko as a great scientist, and the taboo on genetics continued (but all geneticists were released or rehabilitated posthumously). The ban was only waived in the mid-1960s.

	Starting from 1949, Lysenkoism was imported from Russian and established in China. With the aid of Soviet advisors, it quickly gained hegemony in the biological sciences. Even after it lost this position in China, its debilitating effects were felt for decades.

	The initial victims of Lysenkoism and beneficiarious of the Hundred Schools policy belonged to a group of about fifty scientists who received their doctorates from American universities. Most were trained in the joint program for plant genetics and improvement sponsored by Nanjing and Cornell Universities. Others studied and collaborated with T. H. Morgan's groups at Columbia and Caltech.

	...Lysenko legitimized and enhanced the appeal of his transformist programs by coopting the nativist and populist aura that surrounded the peasant horticulturalst I. V. Michurin (1855-1935). Lysenkoism's success in China depended on the Michurin imagery: the earth, grizzled farmer whos personal involvement with production is the source of endless creative innovation. Lysenko followed Michurin's trial-and-error technique, eschewing experimental controls, pure lines, and statistical evaluation of results.

	...Te Lysenkoist doctrine argues that, by maniplating an orgamisms' environment, one can alter its characteristcs and also alter its heredity, and so cause new characteristics to be inherited by the organism's progeny. This doctrine had special appeals: It bypassed the complexities of modern genetics with a scheme that was, in the words of the Chinese practitions, "easy to explain to the masses, and easy for the peasant minds to grasp." It promised quick, inexpensive results.

	...His job was to implement the "mass line" in science and education. This line empasized populist and nativist values which resonated strongly with Lysenkoism. Perhaps this was a factor in the continuting failure of Yanan to attract scientists to its fold.

	...Luo's campaign propaganda initially stressed its ideological correctness.

	...Even though the CCP did not issue any policy statement on Lysenkoism until 1952, Lysenkoism's quest for monopoly and the status of orthodoxy had already been achieved, de facto, with the license and cnouragement afforded by the CCP's comprehensive pro-Soviet policy of "learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union."

	As early as October 1949, Lyseko's representatives were in China, helping Luo Tianyu's campaign. First came V.N Stoletov, Minister of Higher Education and Chair of the Department of Genetics at Moscow University. He lectured at Luo's University, and was soon followed by other Lysenkoist luminaries, such as N. I. Nuzhdin and A. P. Ivanov. These visiting experts traveled extensively throughout China, giving introductory lectures which were rapidly transformed into college textbooks in the Chinese language. The Russians also preached to key scientists about Lysenkoism's scientific validity and effectivness.

Distributed literature, campaign to censor disagreement

	The Lysenkoist campaign was almost impossible to assail from any solid institutional base. There were not yet an centralized science-planning agencies nor any science plan to which anti-Lysenkoists could appeal. Leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture, while not necessarily themselves Lysenkoists, nevertheless were strongly attracted to the docrinte because of their empirical and pragmatic bias.

Luo criticized for attacking other scientists, but Lysenkoism made official CCP policy.

	...He had written that "the fields are a laboratory; nature is a classroom." Morever, he set mass science above that of the intellectuals, saying that the People are genuine materialists, who grasp the answers to things directroy, because, if they do not understand and live by the laws of nature, they die. Since scholars do not operate this way, they are idealists.

Sounds like he knew he was bullshitting?

Tan knew it was bullshit but got crunched

	...In 1950, Nuzhdin and othe rRUssian lysenkoists tried with conspicuous lack of success to convert Tan.

	...Tan's public "self-criticism" in August 1952 was the political ritual that formally legitimized Lysenkoism.

	..on the eve of Russia's massive assistance with China's 1st Five-year Plan, the putative success of Soviet science, including Lysenkoism, seemed to be the surest guide.


	..Soviet contributions to China's science and technology were comprehensive and of varied significance.

	...By the mid-1950's, thousands of advanced Chinese students were studying in a variety of disciplines in various Soviet universities. Hundreds of Soviet scientists came to Chinese universities to offer introductory courses in their specialties and to give stat-of-the-art colloquia to research in the institutes.

	As of yet, no thorough assessment has been made of this Soviet legacy to China's S&T.

	...This contributed to a Chinese preoccupation with immediate and demostrable production applications to justify research. Often, basic research was denigrated.

Is that were they got it from?

	Throughout the 1st Five-Year-Plan period, as Soviet-inspired S&T reforms were being implemented, the "Michurin line" flourished. A constant stream of Soviet experts shaped the biology curricula of colleges and universities. In cytlology, the crackpot work of Olga Lepeshenskaya was used to support Lysenko's transformist belifs by supposedly showing that living cells could be created out of non-living organic material. A. V. Dubrovina lectured to huge audiences on Lysenko's version of Darwin, and introduced that there was niether rivalry nor "mutual aid" among organisms within a specious. I. E. Glushchenko, leader of Lysenko's international program, and other agricultural experts gave extensive lectures explaining the relationship between Lysenko's "New Darwinism" and plant cultivation programs.

	Except as the target of nasty epithets, classical genetics dissappeared from podium and print.

Boa Whenkui was purged

	...This may have been encouraged by Chinese Lysenkoists as a tactic to get at their enemies indirectly.

So after Krushev criticized Lysenko, they decided to stop purging anti-Lysenkoists?

	...Into the 1960s, leadership of the Michurinists continued in the ands of Lua Tianyu's cloest associates: Zu Deming, Liang Zhenglan, and Hu Han (the only one of this group to receive education in the Soviet Union).

	The second problem unique to the social scientist is that he is in a position to distort his research results in a subtle manner very difficult to trace to Communism. Thus, Trofim Lysenko, the Russian geneticist, distorted his research results to conform with Marxist theories of environment, but, biology being a more exact science, expertments were available to discredit him immediately. Such deliberate distortion by a Communist social scientist is harder to detect and much harder to prove.

Why did they stop with Lysenko? at that point I guess the Chinese could have realized the causes of the great famine?

	In retrospect, it appears that Lyenko's doctrinal approach had long been unpopular in scientific-intellectual circles, and had only been sustained in recent years by Krushchev's support, voiced in public as recently as December 1963.


	...Other hitherto-unavailable volumes are also scheduled, including the complete works of Albert Einstein (in four volumes) and a book of writings by N. Ya. Marr, whose theories on Marxism and linguistics were rejected by Stalin in 1950 as "anti-Marxist and unscientific."

	In 1920, right after the end of the Russian Civil War, Vladimir Lenin order People's COmmisar of Agriculture Semion Sereda to organize an analytic research project on Michurin's works and practical achievements. On September 11, 1922, Mikhail Kalinin visited Michurin at Lenin's personal request. 

	...Michurin made a major contribution in the development of genetics, especially in the field of pomology.

	There were also, inevitably, images such as Michurin and Kalinin, 1949 (Fig 6). Mikhail Kalinin, nominal Soviet head of state 1919-1946 and the only "old Bolshevik" no to be "purged" by Stalin, had some passing connections with agriculture. The image arguable underlined Lysenko's emphasis on Michurin as having been "discovered" by the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party, and thus, his status as having been approved by both Party and state. Historically, both the extent of Lenin's awareness of Michurin, and the date when Kalinin may have visited Michurin's nursury in Tambov province (either 1919 or 1922) seem unclear. But the myth of Lenin's discovery of Michurin, and Kalinin's accolades about Michurin's work became rooted in public consiousness, both in the USSR and abroad through Aleksandr Dovzhenko's film, Michurin: A Life in Bloom (1948), released on January 1, 1949.

	I. V. Michurin, in turn, was a proponent of Lamarckism. Lamarck was an 18th century French scientist who argued for a theory of evolution long before Darwin. Lamarck's theory, however, has been rejected by evolutionary scientists because it is not nearly as powerful an explanation of evolution as natural selection.

What is this? "JOURNAL (BOTANICHESKIL ZHURNAL) AND SOME OF OUR SCIENTISTS IS DISCUSSED


	The reply of N.S. Kruschev: "The staff must be looked over. Evidently, people who were selected as editors are against Michurin's science. As long as they remain there nothing will change. They must be replaced, others, real Michurinites, must be appointed. Therin lies the radical solution of the problem." The wrong direction taken by the editorial board of the "Botanical Journal" [Botanicheekii Zhurnal] has been voiced in a number of articles. THey do not bear the character of an occasional, isolated incident, but characterize a position that pursued the objective of censuring the fundamental propostitions in the works of Academician Lysenko.

pg. 5


	The estimate of losses that individual Michurinite scientists and, in particular, Academican T.D. Lysenko had, allegedly, caused the State are completely inaccurate and unrealistic, which has been justly described in the editorial in the newspaper "Pravda".


pg 6.

	In any case, by now it is obvious to all that Michurin's direction in genetics is not just a local Russian phenomenon in science. At the Congress, several reports were made by scientists from Switzerland, Japan, England and other countries who by virtue of the brilliant examples of their own experiments demonstrated conclusively to what extent their approach to the study of hereditary phenomena had been enriched since they had acquanted themselves with Michirin's works and had begun to use these principles in their own investigation.

pg 7.

	A tendency to revise a serious of principles of contemporary genetics in the light of Michurin's teaching has been observed in foreign science. The teaching on the independence of heredity from external conditions and the problem of hereditary transmissino of acquired characteristics are becoming increasingly subjects of doubt. Thus, the basic principles of Michurin's genetics increasingly attract the attention of and exert their influence upon West-European science.

pg 8.
	"Michurin's direction in biology is based on firm foundation of dialectic materialism, it continues and develops the great Darwin teaching. Therin lies its perceptive strength and practical efficacy..." ("Pravda, no 349 of December 14, 1956).

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Lysenkoism#Holodomor
	You sure? I was always under the impression that this was a purely political situation, deliberately targeting the "Kulaks" and other enemies of the revolution, not some unintended consequence of misguided pseudoscience. PintOfStout Talk BRONIES! 19:30, 7 January 2012 (UTC) 


https://ravelledesoterica.wordpress.com/2014/05/13/lysenkos-farm/
	Their resistance to collectivism, among other things, was a problem.  The Holodomor was the solution that Stalin employed.  Once the crops failed, Stalin saw to it that relief was unavailable and help would not be forthcoming.  Grain was traded for export instead of feeding the populus.  More than seven million died, with Odessa suffering some of the worst of it.  Whether Lysenko knew of this from his lofty perch at the top of Stalin’s favoured list is not known.  However he was busy asserting his power himself. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor
	Conquest, R. W. Davies and Stephen G. Wheatcroft believe that, had industrialisation been abandoned, the famine would have been "prevented" (Conquest),[85] or at least significantly alleviated:

    		[W]e regard the policy of rapid industrialisation as an underlying cause of the agricultural troubles of the early 1930s, and we do not believe that the Chinese or NEP versions of industrialisation were viable in Soviet national and international circumstances.[86]:626

	They see the leadership under Stalin as making significant errors in planning for the industrialisation of agriculture. Dr. Michael Ellman of the University of Amsterdam argues that, in addition to deportations, internment in the Gulag camps and shootings (See: Law of Spikelets), there is evidence that Stalin used starvation as a weapon in his war against the peasantry.[87] He analyses the actions of the Soviet authorities, two of commission and one of omission: (i) exporting 1.8 million tonnes of grain during the mass starvation (enough to feed more than five million people for one year), (ii) preventing migration from famine afflicted areas (which may have cost an estimated 150,000 lives) and (iii) making no effort to secure grain assistance from abroad (which caused an estimated 1.5 million excess deaths), as well as the attitude of the Stalinist regime in 1932–33 that many of those starving to death were "counter-revolutionaries", "idlers" or "thieves" who fully deserved their fate.

	...Genocide scholar Adam Jones stresses that many of the actions of the Soviet leadership during 1931–32 should be considered genocidal. Not only did the famine kill millions, it took place against "a backdrop of persecution, mass execution, and incarceration clearly aimed at undermining Ukrainians as a national group"

So is that it? they just saw Ukranians, Chinese as a threat?

	The Canadian wheat pool", Williams writes, "sent on of its most promising officials, Andrew Cairns, on a serious of trips through EUropean and other areas of Russian, in 1930 and 1932. His breif mission was to examine the state of the Russian wheat crop, which he was able to do with an expert eye. The results of these visits give a fascinating insight into the disatrous polices, not only of collectivization, with its liquidation of the 'Kulaks', but also of the effects of Soviet agronomist Lysenko's crackpot agricultural techniques. The second visit, during May 1932, organized uder the auspices of the British embassy in Moscow, produced three rports of quite unprecedented detail on the decline of Russian agriculture, and especially on the massive destruction of cereal crops in Ukraine."

	Even the Soviet Union allowed a tightly restricted liberty of action to certain intellectuals--mostly prominent scientists, always a privileged category. THe bilogist Zhores Medvedev, whos 1960s exposure of Lysenko had long circulated in samizdat, was first harassed and then deprived of his citizenship. He setteld in the UK in 1973. But Andrei Sakharov, the country's best-known nuclear physicist and a longstanding critic of the regmine, remained at liberty--until his public opposition to the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan rendered his presence intolerable.

	By this time, Lysenko had expanded his basic set of biological ideas in two directions. He took guidance respectively from I. I. Prezent (1902-1970?), an influential ideologue with pretensions of expertise in dialectical materialism, and I. V. Michurin (1855-1935), a homegrown horticulturist iconized by Lenin. Their respective roles warrant a breif summary here because the "Lsyenkoism" that was brought to China in 1949 was an amalgam of their ideas and those of T. D. Lysenko.

	...Michurin used intiutive, trial-and-error techniques that he said were successful because of his intimate familiarity with his local environment and his personal, hands-on involvement in the selection and breeding process. Moreover, Michurin pooh-poohed formal agricultural science tough in big cities and in universities wehre no one got their hands dirty, no one was involved directly in production, and everyone was caught up in fancy theories, mathematical techniques and statistics that bore no relationship to reality. Lysenko approvingly echoed Michurin's anti-intellectualism and mockery of establishment biology, and he used Michurin to legitimize his own famous lack of experimental rigor. By the time Lysenkoism was introduced to China, Michurin had become its patron saint and cheif exemplar. Lysenko and his apostles introduced their work to China under the name of "Michurinims" (Mi-chu-lin-zhuy), a name that stuck throughout the entire period of Lysenkoist dominance there.

	I. I. Prezent ... though he began his career as a partisan of Mendelian and Morganist theories of heredity and speciation, he had reversed that position by the time he established a power base in a variety of academic positions. He aided Lysenko's rise to dominance in SOviet biology and provided him with the trappings of ideological legitimacy--a dialetical materialist and propelry socialist rationale for attacking and rejecting classical genetics. Lysenko took from Prezent the argument that science inveitably has a class nature: If Marxism is correct, then how could science developed within bourgeois-capitalist society be appropritate for a revolutionary socialist one? Science produced by and practiced in a bourgeois-capitalist society could only be idealist, formalistic, metaphysical. Only science that evolved out of a socialist society, like Lysenko's biology, was valid.

ABSTRACT
.
The  establishment  of  an  “official”  biology  in  the  S
oviet  Union  is
often  associated with  the rise of Trofim D.  Lysenko
 and with the unbridled
power that he exercised with the active complicity 
of Stalin. However, Lysenko
did not apply his tyrannical methods with the same 
effectiveness and to the
same ends throughout his career. The institutionali
zation of the new agron
-
omy involved a complex combination of factors, and 
the power and charisma
of those who surrounded Lysenko greatly facilitated
 his indoctrination of this
branch of science. One of the most influential coll
aborators of Lysenko was the
Marxist ideologist and Party official Isaak Izraile
vich Prezent, whose relation
-
ship  with  Lysenko  is  crucial  to  understand  Lysenko’
s  development  from  a
simple plant breeder to a political force of the So
viet Union.



 	...Stalin also contributed in no small way to the “education” of Lysenko: “Stalin wrote memos, held meetings, and offered editorial comments in or der to support attacks against Mendelian genetics” 


The information we have on Prezent is sparse, yet every historian who has  enquired  into his  political role in Soviet culture has concluded that every field of study that Prezent touched upon, he ruined.


	Paradoxically, only five years earlier, Prezent and Lysenko had actively supported the very concepts of genetics against which they later battled so vigorously, asserting the affinities between Marxism and Morganism (Medvedev, 1969).

https://www.britannica.com/biography/Zhores-Aleksandrovich-Medvedev#ref275700
	In the 1960s Medvedev wrote a history of Soviet science with the aim of discrediting the doctrines of T.D. Lysenko, the charlatan who dominated Soviet biology during the reign of Joseph Stalin (1929–53) and whose assaults on classical genetics crippled Soviet biology for decades. The Soviet authorities refused to publish Medvedev’s book, which was circulated in samizdat (the Soviet literary underground) until its publication in the West under the title The Rise and Fall of T.D. Lysenko in 1969. The Soviet government denied Medvedev opportunities to attend scientific conferences abroad despite his growing reputation as a scientist, and he underwent constant harassment from the KGB from the mid-1960s on. He detailed his travails, which included a brief forced stay in a mental hospital, in the books The Medvedev Papers (1970) and A Question of Madness (1971), the latter coauthored with his brother Roy.

	Polls say that Americans trust scientists more than, say, politicians, but that trust is on the decline. If we’re losing faith in science, we’ve gone down the wrong path. Science is no more than a process (as recent contributors to our “Why I Like Science” series have noted), and skepticism can be a good thing. But for many people that skepticism has grown to the point that they can no longer accept good evidence when they get it, with the result that “we’re now in an epidemic of fear like one I’ve never seen and hope never to see again,” says Michael Specter, author of Denialism, in his TEDTalk below.

I'm sure she's happy

	This path has the potential to lead to some pretty dark times, as Specter says:

		When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science, you end up in a place you don’t want to be. You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa. He killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS. Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease.


http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/does-climate-change-cause-war-66970734/
	We can also see from these studies that there are no easy answers in this arena. Any conflict—even one as simple as an argument with a neighbor that ends in a fistfight—has a complex set of factors that work together to foster the violence. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand may have started World War I, but it didn’t cause it. And countries aren’t going to go to war with each other because their local climate has slowly changed over decades. But those changes could contribute to other internal and international strife and have consequences we cannot foresee. As one intelligence source told Wired in 2008, “Climate change is a threat multiplier in the world’s most unstable regions….It’s like a match to the tinder.”

https://www.psychopathfree.com/articles/understanding-how-sociopaths-think-why-it-is-good-to-ask-why.278/
	Sociopaths are not easily identified. In fact, it can be exceptionally difficult to determine if someone is a sociopath. Even professionals are easily fooled, and many counselors have a poor understanding of personality disorders in general. In addition, some people exhibit more sociopathic traits than others, which is why sociopathy lies on a spectrum. Some sociopathic people are very obviously egotistical, for example; others are much more covert in their narcissism. That is just one example of the differences. Perhaps this is why several terms have been used to describe people who exhibit abnormal personality traits, including sociopath, psychopath, and narcissist. To further add to the confusion, psychologists, therapists, and researchers do not agree on which terms should be used or how they should be defined. Despite this controversy, the fact remains that a person who exhibits any number of sociopathic traits is toxic and should be avoided. 

So is Okhrana mostly sociopaths? "criminally minded", sadists, that sort of ting? if comorbid with other mental diseases often they would have a lot of weaknesses

	As of 2008, more than half of Russians view Stalin positively, and many support restoration of his monuments either dismantled by leaders or destroyed by rioting Russians during the 1991 dissolution of the USSR.

bad sign

war inevitable?

	According to the Levada polling centre, Stalin's popularity marks have tripled among Russians in the last 20 years, and the trend had accelerated since Vladimir Putin has come to power

done deliberately? maybe license for a repeat


	In June 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a conference for history teachers to promote a high-school teachers manual called A Modern History of Russia: 1945-2006: A Manual for History Teachers, which according to Irina Flige, office director of human rights organization Memorial, portrays Stalin as a cruel but successful leader who "acted rationally".


I can believe that... but toward what end?

	In 2009, it was reported that the Russian government was drawing up plans to criminalize statements and acts that deny the Soviet Union's victory over fascism in World War II or its role in liberating Eastern Europe.[46] In May 2009, President Dmitry Medvedev described the Soviet Union during the war as "our country" and set up the Historical Truth Commission to act against what the Kremlin terms falsifications of Russian history.


They care about this a lot seems like. Like they're afraid of something? clearly still trying to cover up their activities decades later. I guess understanding what they were up to in WW1-WW2 helps understand how they work. So they wouldn't want the world to learn.

	When Stalin wrote to his collaborators that “we may lose Ukraine,” he was by no means expressing a paranoid suspicion. Stalin’s own analysis of future developments in Ukraine is revealing. His letter to Kaganovich about the possibility of losing Ukraine was dated August 11, 1932.

fuck this makes a lot of sense. Would explain why he wanted Hitler to invade Ukraine and have his forces "liberate" them. Wanted them to see his regime as liberators and better.

	Stalin was convinced by a series of peasant uprisings that were a response to the policy of collectivization. Any awareness of these uprising was carefully concealed by the regime. Even the possibility of an uprising and victory over authoritarianism is its greatest defeat. It is not by accident that Nazis razed to the ground the Sobibor concentration camp where the prisoners had defeated the SS. Afterwards, the Soviet authorities ignored the success of this uprising for years. The logic of both the Stalin and Hitler regimes was that evil cannot be overcome and power cannot be resisted. This is what they were protecting. This is why they were hiding the truth.

were they really that edgy? just a bunch of nutjobs being evil on purpose?

Soviets developed anthrax?

	Antibiotics can squash an anthrax infection. There’s a vaccine as well. In fact, it was the Soviet’s tinkering with a vaccine strain of B. anthracis that provided the first hints of biowarfare research. In the 1960s, researchers purposefully made a vaccine strain resistant to multiple antibiotics. The stated goal was to make a vaccine that could survive the antibiotics used to treat an active anthrax infection, which would not be resistant to drugs. But the researchers went further. They genetically tweaked the drug-resistant bacteria to evade the immune responses trained by a vaccine. The explanation was that researchers wanted to study how B. anthracis alters the immune system. However, the final product was infectious bacteria that could evade immune responses as well as multiple drugs.

to  mutation-inducing  chemicals  or  irradiation,  then  would  recover  mutants  that  
possessed improved or enhanced characteristics related to infectivity, virulence, and

ous types of animals were used as test subjects, including cats, rabbits, goats, and 
horses.

	Analysis: Crossing Obama's "red line" on Syria will require concrete proof

	Raymond Zilinskas, a chemical and biological weapons expert at the Monterey Institute's James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said photographic evidence cited by the Israeli official - with victims foaming at the mouth - showed symptoms consistent with the use of a nerve agent such as sarin gas.

	But he questioned whether photographic evidence alone could prove chemical weapons use.

	"The difficult part is - what you really need are samples," said Zilinskas.

A beijing doctor recorded: "We were told that the Soviets had discovered and invented everything; we had to change textbooks and rename things in Lysenko's honour.'

Mao made Lysenko official policy in 1958 when he personally drafted an eight-point agricultural 'constitution' based on theories of crop growth advanced by Lysenko and his Chinese disciples, which farmers were forced to follow. The eight headings were:

- Use new breeds and seeds
- plant closely
- plough deeply

	Temporary shortages of some non-staple foods is a problem now claiming considerable attention. The shortages have arisen notwithstanding a 49 percent increase in live pigs and the doubling of aquatic products. A recent Renmin Reibao editorial (December 28, 1958) gave the following analysis: On the supply side, considerable manpower has been concentrated in recent months on steel production, the harvesting of the tremendous crops, deep ploughing the land and extending irrigation works. This has had some effect on the production of raw materials for some non-staple foods.

	...With the establishment of community dining-rooms in the people's communes, the peasants are eating more and better food than ever before. As a result, demand is running ahead of supply.

	For imperialism, 1958 was a year fraught with troubles and disasters. The economic crisis which broke out in the United States is spreading to engulf the entire capitalist world. Industrial production of the United States dropped about 7 per cent in 1958, as compared with 1957. Steel output in that country fell from 113 million tons in 1957 to 84 million tons in 1958, representing a drop of 25.6 percent.

I wonder if communism helped them with recruiting? the ones who realized it was bullshit and played games and schemed to get ahead could be noticed and recruited by the KGB.

	Cultural factors, as measured by the two dimensions of values identified by Inglehart, explain 75% of the variation in the Perceived Corruption Index across non-communist countries. A strong ‘survival’ orientation contributes twice as much as a strong ‘traditional’ orientation to higher levels of corruption. When controlling for these cultural variables, communism and post-communism increase the levels of corruption even further, both directly and by contributing to heavier emphasis on survival values. Communism created structural incentives for engaging in corrupt behaviors, which became such a widespread fact of life that they became rooted in the culture in these societies--that is, the social norms and practices prevailing in communist societies. The transitions toward democracy and market economies have not yet erased this culture of corruption. In addition, the process of privatization itself has opened myriad opportunities for corruption. The effects are manifest in comparisons of corruption in non-communist and (post-)communist countries in five cultural zones.

	Pushing villagers to work around the clock, the party leaders organized Da Fo's school-age children to march and demonstrate in the streets, shouting slogans: "We will work during the day, we will work during the night; we will work all day and all night!" By late 1959 many villagers barely had the energy to walk or hold their heads up, and yet in the months to follow they were ordered to dig half mu of and in the day and half mu at night, as part of the deep plowing campaign, which was undertaken in the mistaken belief that the deeper the farmers plowed, the larger the root systems of their crops would be. The result was predictable: only those who cheated survived. Pang Renjing was not one of them. Zheng Jintian recounts the story:

		Pang Renjing died during the Great Leap Forward. He died of exhaustion, not starvation. He was sixteen years old at the time. The Liangmen People's Commune leaders selected young and capable people to do the deep digging of the soil. Everybody tried to cheat. Instead of deep digging, most villagers would simply dig up part of the soil and then cover up the rest with dirt to make it look like they had done the deep digging. Pang Renjing was not smart enough to do that. He was honest, and he dug earnestly. As a result, he fell behind others. He worked harder and harder. In the end, he suffered from overexhaustion and an intestinal disorder. People tried to send him to Dongle County hospital, but he died on the way there.


Is this what they wanted? the honest to die out and those who learned how to lie and cheat to survive? kindof like killing off everybody who doesn't think like them.

	Liu Shao-chi, greeting the conference on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese COmmunist Party, gave the meaning of last year's victory. "In agriculture," he said, "we have found the way to develop proudction at high speed, begun to to change its backward condition and doubled the output of grain, cotton and some other crops. It must be considered a great achievement that the annual output of grain reached about 1,200 jin per capita in a country as big and populous as ours."

	...The Chinese peasants, in reaping bumper crops last year, made valuable contributions to science by exploding out-moded theories, said Kuo Mo-jo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in his greeting to the conference. THe steps for raising farm output centering on deep ploughing, opened out a new road for scientfic study of soils, plant physiology, crops cultivation and related fields. The record crops show that the rich experience of the Chinese peasants, accumulated over centuries of practical activity, is an ocean of wisdom, an inexhaustible mine of knowledge. Science today is no longer the monopoly of the few, Kuo Mo-jo continued, and the bumper-crops are a result partly of the fact that the masses have begun to master science.

	...The reasons for the record crops in 1958, Liao Lu-yen, Minister of Agriculture, told the conference, may be summed up in three points.

	First, putting politics in command. This, in essence, means strengthening leadership by the Communist Party. Only with politics in command, can the general line for building socialism be correctly carried out and the communist spirit of bold thinking, speech and action be developed.

	Secondly, the mass line.

	...Thirdly, the "Eight-Point Charter of Agriculture" (See point 4 of the "Ten Big Probosals above--Ed.)

	Speakers at the conference told how, by following these principles, a number of provinces doubled or even trebled their grain output last year and achieved similar increases with other crops.

	Public Health: The masses should revise plans to combat the "five evils" (flies, mosquitoes, rats, grain-eating sparrows and snails) ...These should, in the main, be wiped out in one or two years.


For the people who bought this they might have felt an honest sense of comraderie, a desire to help each other, most would just not realize its bullshit. So the people who realized its bullshit might naturally take the opposite view, that it's every man for himself, and these would be the people the KGB would recuirt.

Also see the same sort of ideas promoted by Ayn Rand, hating not just the Communist system but the ideas of comradier and working to help one another. Presumably Any Rand acolytes would make good KGB recruits.

	Dzhirkvelov writes that although he never opposed the Soviet regime, he was disturbed by the increasing corruption of the privileged elite, the fierce power struggles at the top, the heavy drinking and immoral ways of the ideological leaders "and their utter contempt for the ordinary people." He was especially disturbed when his spy masters began treating him with contempt; he defected to the West in 1980. A 30-year veteran of the KGB, Dzhirkvelov's descriptions of organizational structures at various levels along with operational techniquesincluding activities he took part inrepresent a rare insider's look at the Soviet security system. On the other hand, this defector claims that the 1953 "doctor's plot" against Stalin was nothing more than "an amusing idea" of the Western media, that the KGB is not as powerful as is generally thought in the West, and that stories of religious persecution in the Soviet Union are greatly exaggerated.

	In the three months following the December plenum, there continued to be significant differences in emphasis between the pronouncements of the party machine figures and those of the administrator-economists. The former group-including Li Shoa-chi and Tan Chen-lin and Liao Lu-yen, and possibly Teng Hsiao-ping and Peng Chen in their unpublished speeches, supported the economic specialist P I-po who a year earlier had seemd to gover over almost completely to the party-machine group--chose to emphasize themes that would make it appear that they had been right all along. There were the leaders who stronglydefended the policies and programs of 1958, who again implied that Chinese programs were applicable to other bloc states, who reaffirmed the principle of "putting politics in command"

	Evidence of mounting concern appeared in the December commune resolution, which stressed the importance of "a practical and realistic style of work," warned against the current tendency of "exaggeration, I' and asserted that "lead- ing personnel at all levels must be good at differentiating between the reality and the false appearance of things.'' Minister of Agriculture Liao Lu-yen was more explicit in a 1 January 1959 Red Flag article when he criticized "exaggeration, -- - 72 - S'RET lies, and falsification'' in the reporting of agricultural statistics. According to People's Daily on 19 December, sample investigations had revealed these "exaggerations" to be both extensive and premeditated, with cadres "knowing that actual production was only 500 but reporting as 600, 800, or even 1,000;'' After dismissing the threat of the ''account settlers" (who would 'Iseize the opportunity to stage a coun- terattack'*), the article concluded by calling on cadres every- where to verify and correct-harvest statistics and thus obvi- ate the IIvery dangerous" situation of faulty data resulting in unrealistic policies and plans. 


pg 6

	The final stage in the assumption of party control over agricultural'development was the adoption of a set of 9nore advanced" agricultural techniques which came to be known as the "eight point charter of agricultural production.11 Described as a codification of the rich experience gainedin the cultiva- tion of experimental high-yield plots in the spring and summer of 1958, this "garden culture" technique consisted of eight basic rules of agricultural production, with special emphasis on deep-plowing and close-planting as the means for achieving a technological breakthrough in agriculture. This in turn would permit implementing Mae's concept of land cultivation which was aimed at the reduction of sown acreage "in the next several years** to one-third of the existing level. With the accompany- ing injunction to China's agronomists to take Vhairman Mao's ideology as basic" in their research and study, first agri- cultural planning, then agricultural statistics and finally agricultural science were being subordinated to political ends in the best Stalinist tradition. 


pg 8

	The final function of the commune conceived primarily as an economic organization was to accelerate the mechanization and electrification of agriculture. As was the case with the mass line of industrial development, the program of technical revolution in agriculture announced by the Chinese Communists in 1958 was characterized by shifting content and destined for ignominious failure. Following short-lived experiments with locally produced baby tractors and the "native" production of ball bearings, the Chinese Communists claimed in September to have discovered in the towing-cable machine ,*a short-cut to agricultural mechanization and electrification under the concrete conditions of our country." 

"electrification" of agriculture?

Maybe they wanted their agriculture to rely on electricity so it would be easier to shut it down and starve them?

kindof reminds me of "vertical farming" today


http://ageconsearch.tind.io//bitstream/136607/2/fris-1962-03-01-426.pdf
	Above all, the commune was intended to be a highly efficient device for mobilizing and making productive use of every able-bodied adult in the country- side, and once communalization was completed, the already relentless work pace was stepped up. In agriculture the guideposts were a number of super intensive (and generally untested) farming practices that came to be known as Mao's "Eight-Point Charter."4 During the summer of 1958, deep plowing was the aim principally stressed-the "central technical measure for increasing agricultural output" (9, p. 24). According to the flamboyant propaganda of the day, up to fivefold increases in yield could be had with this practice alone. Instead of the customary depth of five to six inches, deep plowing generally was ordered to a depth of a foot or more; in some cases even to ten feet (9, p. 24). Vast quantities of fertilizer were then added. The amount of fertilizer-primarily night soil, compost, and pond mud-applied in 1958 is said to have averaged 60 tons per acre, or ten times more than in 1957 (10, p. 21). These are average figures; even greater efforts were apparently made by some communes. In Anlwo county near Peking, for instance, it was reported that 66,000 acres of winter wheat were pre- pared by being plowed-or rather dug, for the work was accomplished chiefly by peasants wielding spades-to a depth of 1.2 to 1.5 feet, and then fertilized at a rate of 150 tons per acre. These efforts, it was claimed, would result in a yield of 15 tons per acre in 1959, or "about ten times the average yield in Denmark, which leads the world in wheat yield per unit area"

	Third, we must reform farming techniques and tools in a more meticulous and scientific way on the basis of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. Expanded reproduction may be carried out in two ways. The first way is expanded reproduction under the circumstance that the technical conditions remain unchanged. This depends mainly on increases in the amount of labour employed and the raising of labour productivity, etc.


https://books.google.com/books?id=9pPxwn6EvR4C&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=%22Eight-Point+Charter%22+Mao&source=bl&ots=XP2KPvmbbi&sig=R_KuZYxZoKmdrOjN0LlmiAWKw30&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwitzP-S1NnTAhXE7YMKHTo9AjAQ6AEISDAM#v=onepage&q=%22Eight-Point%20Charter%22%20Mao&f=false
	Of the seventeen issues Mao included for discussion at the first day of the Beidaihe Conference, Mao particularly emphasized deep plouging, which, he said, was the principal direction for agricultre, as without it large quantities of fertilizer could not be added. Deep ploughing was also the basis for close planting, so in the MOrth the ploughed depth should be 30 cm, whereas in the South, it could be 20 to 23 cm. After three year's hard work, Mao maintained, two thirds of all farmland could be sufficient to support the population, and one-third could be used for afforestation.

	...Mao's idea was that ALL farmland should be deep plouged once within two to three years, and then the cycle would be repeated again. ...THis directive, apart from the decision to double steel output in 1958 and to form communes, was perhaps the most influential, and it was to quickly set in motion a massive campaign involving hundreds of millions of people in the winter/spring of 1958/9.	

	...ideology was enlisted to legitimize current policies. ...The primary reason why some places had not boosted production was that eaders there were either 'capitalist elements' or 'rightist conservatives.' Only when 'unrelentless struggles were carried out against thse leaders resulting in their resignation', had the high tide for production emerged.

	...Yet, the MA never wavered from pushing Mao's every preference. Sometime in September, Mao said that it was fundamentally wrong to run agricultural and forestry academies in the cities, as the students should integrate themselves with the peasants in order to 'toil hard' for three years. The MA took this seriously, so between 20 and 30 September it convened a national conference on combining education with labour, and decided that all students and staff of all agricultural academies should be sent into the countryside for labour training. Immediately after the conferences, 47,000 teachers and students from 28 academies were sent to the villages, ranches, and factories as labour.

	...A definint characteristic of the GLF was hyperbolic misinformation for which the politicized MA was largely responsible. In the autumn, it expanded its role further by siezing the function of compiling national agricultural statistics from the State Statistics Bureau. In October, it had already published, in book form, the finalized statistics for 1957 which in turn were not issued by the Statistics Bureau until April 1959. THis dealt another fatal blow to a relatively reliable statistical system on agricultural production in China. On 13 October, the MA again took the limelight and announced in three separate communique's an unprecedented bountiful harvest in early rice, spring wheat, and rapeseed.

	...As procurement allotment had been calculated on the assumption of an extraordinarily bountiful harvest that did not exist, a violent struggle for grain between the government and the peasants erupted in the autumn. From July to October, procurement of agricultural products was slow and behind schedule.  ...According to reports by certain central ministries, as early as April 1959, 25 million people in fifteen provinces did not have enough to eat. Vegetables, oil, pork, and other subsidiary foods were also in short supply.


	...yet, the Party was ambivalent. On the one hand, it called for an urgent mobilization and an 'all-out concentrated attack' on the autumn tasks. On the other hand, it refused to acknowledge the acute labour shortage, even though it admitted that the iron and steel campaign had crippled agricultural production by siphoning off agricultural labour.

	...At the initial stage of communization in early September, Tan Zhenlin reassured Mao with a rosy report that claimed that communes had been formed rapidly and smoothly, and that only in a minority of places had the peasants resorted to slaughtering and selling of livestock, felling trees, and grain concealment. However, an anonymous letter dated 5 September reached Mao in early October informing him that food shortages at several xiang in Anhui had killed over 500 people, and that many had become ill. The food shortages were attributed to natural calamities, false-reporting, and administrative commands which forced the conversion of dry land into rice paddies. As discusssed in Chapter 2, Mao had single-handedly imposed the communes by following his instincts. The communes radically transformed rural economic organization and ways of life but were introduced hastily and virtually without advanced testing and preparation. Consequently, the countryside was plunged into chaos, as organization and incentives problems plauged the campaign from the start. As previously mentioned, only by October/November did Mao begin to realize the full effects of the 'communist winds' and the universal concealment of grain and slaughter of livestock among the peasants. Coercive grass-roots cadres who exaggerated reports of yields had led to high procurement, which in turn deprived the peasants of grain, leading to deaths. Mao's confidence began to be shaken, but he still cherished the utopian ideal.

	By winter 1958, some mess halls in the communes had run out of food, leading to outward migration oedema, and abnormal deaths. Peasants were fleeing, begging, and battling for food. By early 1958, spring famine had already occurred, and many provinces affected ...were short of grain.

	...Mao thought that the food shortage problem was restricted to only a few provinces,and transfers from the centre or from other provinces would take care of the problem. ...Back in 1958, before Mao made the authoritative decision, there was nothing the other leaders could do.

	...Meanwhile, another disastrous decision--the 'three-three' system--illustrates the impulsive and aphazard manner by which a general idea and a long-term aspiration of Mao's could be snowballed into a major national policy. Many zealots, in particular Mao's lietenant, Tan, vied eagerly in giving it substance. There was little planning or consideration of alternatives, fervour and intuition alone guiding all the decisions. In October and early November, a series of regional conferences were convened to discuss the plans for 1959 agricultural production, leading to a far-reaching decision to reduce the cultivated acreage for 1959 summer crops, which contributed greatly to the serious food shortages and famine in 1959. The earliest articulation of what turned into the 'three-three' system can be found in Mao's speech made at the third Plenum in October 1957.

	...At about the same time (10-29 September), Deng Xioping, Li Fuchun, and other top leaders inspected the Northeastern provinces (Lianing, Jilin, and Heilongjiang) which were said to be lagging behind other provinces in agricultural production as only a production increase of 20-40 per cent was achieved. According to Deng's diagnosis, these provinces had fallen behind because their leaders had not implemented Mao's 'eight-point charter'; instead they were said to have followed the 'same old stuff' of 'wide spacing and shallow ploughing' and 'extensive cultivation and reap less,' a 'reformist' leadership method. Since 'reformism' was incompatible with the GLF, Deng urged that a 'revolutionary campaign' be launched in agriculture.

	At the Happiness and Rising Sun communes, Deng went a step further and instructed that they should experiment with high yields, and reduce the present cultivated areas so that all efforts could be concentrated on close planting and raising the output/mu. This, he maintained, would increase grain production, allowing the remaining area of land for fallowing or afforestation. All of these paved the way for a formal decision to reduce the cultivated farmland, as we shall see later on.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Zhenlin
	Tan became a central figure opposed to the Central Cultural Revolution Group (CCRG) in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. Tan, along with other Communist revolutionaries such as Chen Yi and Nie Rongzhen, openly attacked the CCRG and their insistence on expanding the Cultural Revolution. Tan bluntly told the assembled leaders that the Cultural Revolution was an attempt to purge the Communist old guard. Tan also reputedly said, "I made three mistakes in my life. I should not have lived to this day. I should have never joined the revolution with Mao. I should have never joined the Communist Party."[2] He was then thoroughly denounced by Lin Biao as part of the "February Countercurrent" and subsequently purged.

Tan encouraging peasants to gorge themselves


http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/aug1975.htm
	The Bangiao Dam was originally designed to pass about 1742 cubic meters of water per second through sluice gates and a spillway. The capacity storage capacity was set at 492 million cubic meters with 375 million cubic meters of this capacity reserved for flood storage. The height of the dam was at little over 116 meters.

	There were some flaws in the design and construction of Banqiao Dam, including cracks in the dam and sluice gates. With advice provided by Soviet engineers the Banqiao Dam and the Shimantan Dam were reinforced and expanded. The Soviet design was called an iron dam, a dam that could not be broken. 

	Once the Banqiao and Shimantan Dams were completed many, many smaller dams were built. Initially the smaller dams were built in the mountains, but in 1958 Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin decreed that the dam building should be extended into the plains of China. The Vice Premier also asserted that primacy should be given to water accumulation for irrigation. A hydrologist named Chen Xing objected to this policy on the basis that it would lead to water logging and alkalinization of farm land due to a high water table produced by the dams. Not only were the warnings of Chen Xing ignored but political officials changed his design for the largest reservoir on the plains. Chen Xing, on the basis of his expertise as a hydrologist, recommended twelve sluice gates but this was reduced to five by critics who said Chen was being too conservative. There were other projects where the number of sluice gates was arbitrarily reduced significantly. Chen Xing was sent to Xinyang.

	When problems with the water system developed in 1961 a new Party official in Henan brought Chen Xing back to help solve the problems. But Chen Xing criticized elements of the Great Leap Forward and was purged as a "right-wing opportunist."

	Mao’s ‘Eight Point Charter of Agriculture’ (1958) was strongly influenced by the theories of Lysenko. Chinese peasant farmers were ordered to embrace ‘Lysenkoism’ and to abandon techniques they had used for centuries. Farmers were ordered to ‘close plant’ seeds and seedlings, being assured by government officials that plants of the same species would not compete for water or nutrients. Lysenkoist theory claimed that deep ploughing the soil would encourage faster, deeper root growth. Chemical fertilisers and pesticides were also banned, the latter replaced by Mao’s disastrous Four Pests campaign (1958). The changes based on Lysenko’s pseudo-science had a disastrous effect on Chinese agricultural production in the late 1950s.

So what is "The Private Life of Chairman Mao" the new "China under the Empress Dowager"?

His excuse that he burned all his notes but remembered Mao's quotes exactly is weak

"Lin Biao never used a toilet. When moving his bowels, he would use a quilt, as if it were a tent, to cover himself and would squat over a bedpan that his wife would place on his bed.

I was astonished. Lin Biao was obviously mentally unsound, but Mao was promoting him to the highest reaches of power. Soon he would be hailed as Mao’s “closest comrade in arms.” One day Lin Biao would be governing the entire nation."

Sounds made up? Lin Biao was nuts in some way but otherwise mentally competent. Qui Jun likes to quote this passage but she's full of shit.

CIA likes "Mao: The Unknown Story"


------


MAD HAD BEEN trying hard, without success, to have one particular
period opera condemned. This was called Hai Rui Dismissed from Office} and
was based on a traditional story of a mandarin who was punished by the
emperor for having spoken up for the peasants. Mao accused it of being a
veiled attack on what he (the "emperor") had done to the purged defence
minister Peng Dehuai, and ordered it to be denounced, along with
Marshal Peng himself

...

When Mao first told the troops that they were about to become
"Mountain Lords" -bandits-they were dumbfounded. This was not why
they had joined a Communist revolution. But, speaking in the name of the
Par he assured them that they would be special bandits-part of an
international revolution. Banditry was also their best chance, he argued:
"Mountain Lords have never been wiped out, let alone us."

...

Mao clashed frequently with his tutors. He ran away from his first
school at the age of ten, claiming that the teacher was a martinet. He was
expelled from, or was "asked to leave," at least three schools for being
headstrong and disobedient. His mother indulged him but his father was
not pleased, and Mao's hopping from tutor to tutor was just one source of
tension between father and son. Yi-chang paid for Mao's education, hop-
ing that his son could at least help keep the family accounts, but Mao dis-
liked the task. All his life, he was vague about figures, and hopeless at
economics. Nor did he take kindly to hard physical labour. He shunned it
as soon as his peasant days were over.

...

I T WAS I N this environment that Mao's views on morals took shape. In
the winter of 1917-18, still a student as he turned twenty-four, he wrote
extensive commentaries on a book called A System of Ethics) by a minor late-
nineteenth-century German philosopher, Friedrich Paulsen. In these
notes, Mao expressed the central elements in his own character, which
stayed consistent for the remaining six decades of his life and defined
his rule.

Mao's attitude to morality consisted of one core, the sel£ "I," above
everything else: "I do not agree with the view that to be moral, the motive
of one's action has to be benefiting others. Morality does not have to be
defined in relation to others . . . People like me want to . . . satisfy our
hearts to the full, and in doing so we automatically have the most valuable
moral codes. Of course there are people and objects in the world, but they
are all there only for me."

Mao shunned all constraints of responsibility and duty: "People like me
only have a duty to ourselves; we have no duty to other people." "I am
responsible only for the reality that I kno" he wrote, "and absolutely not
responsible for anything else. I don't know about the past, I don't know
about the future. They have nothing to do with the reality of my own self"
He explicitly rejected any responsibility towards future generations.
"Some say one has a responsibility for history: I don't believe it. I am only
concerned about developing myself. . . I have my desire and act on it. I am
responsible to no one."

Mao did not believe in anything unless he could benefit from it per-
sonally A good name after death, he said, "cannot bring me any jo
because it belongs to the future and not to my own reality:" "People like
me are not building achievements to leave for future generations." Mao
did not care what he left behind.
He argued that conscience could go to hell if it was in conflict with his
impulses:

	These two should be one and the same. All our actions. . . are driven by
	impulse, and the conscience that is wise goes along with this in every
	instance. Sometimes . . . conscience restrains impulses such as over-
	eating or over-indulgence in sex. But conscience is only there to
	restrain, not oppose. And the restraint is for better completion of the
	impulse.

As conscience always implies some concern for other people, and is not a
corollary of hedonism, Mao was rejecting the concept. His view was: "1 do
not think these [commands like 'do not kill,' 'do not steal' and 'do not slan-
der'] have to do with conscience. 1 think they are only out of self-interest
for self-preservation." All considerations must "be purely calculation for
onesel£ and absolutely not for obeying external ethical codes, or for so-
called feelings of responsibility. . ."

Absolute selfishness and irresponsibility lay at the heart of Mao's out-
look.

These attributes he held to be reserved for "Great Heroes"--a group to which he appointed himself For this elite, he said:

	Everything outside their nature, such as restrictions and constraints,
	must be swept away by the great strength in their nature . . . When
	Great Heroes give full play to their impulses, they are magnificently
	powerful, stormy and invincible. Their power is like a hurricane arising
	from a deep gorge, and like a sex-maniac on heat and prowling for a
	lover. . . there is no way to stop them.

...

When he came to the question "How do we change [China]?," Mao
laid the utmost emphasis on destruction: "the country must be . . .
destroyed and then re-formed." He extended this line not just to China
but to the whole world-and even the universe: "This applies to the coun-
t to the nation, and to mankind . . . The destruction of the universe is
the same. . . People like me long for its destruction, because when the old
universe is destroyed, a new universe will be formed. Isn't that better!"



...he was deterred by having to learn Russian. He made a stab at it, taking
lessons from a Russian emigre (and agent), Sergei Polevoy But according
to Polevoy the other students teased Mao when he could not even master
the alphabet, and he left in a huff Unlike many of his radical contempo-
raries, including most of the future Chinese Communist leaders, Mao
went to neither France nor Russia.

...
pg 18

In Mao's relationship with his mother, while she seems to have shown
unconditional love and indulgence for him, his treatment of her com-
bined strong feelings with selfishness. In later life, he told one of his clos-
est staff a revealing story: "When my mother was dying, I told her I could
not bear to see her looking in agony I wanted to keep a beautiful image of
her, and told her I wanted to stay away for a while. My mother was a very
understanding person, and she agreed. So the image of my mother in my
mind has always been and still is today a healthy and beautiful one." On
her deathbed, the person who took priority in Mao's consideration was
himsel£ not his mother, nor did he hesitate to say so.
Less surprisingl Mao treated his dying father coldly Yi-chang died
from typhoid on 23 January 1920, and before his death he longed to see
his eldest son, but Mao stayed awa and showed no feeling of sadness
for him.


...


Mao's job was to distribute New Youth and other Communist pub-
lications (as well as selling other books and journals). Though not a com-
mitted Communist, Mao was a radical. He also loved books and welcomed
a job. Soon after he returned to Changsha, an advertisement issued about
the bookshop contained the bizarre declaration, penned by himself that:
"There is no new culture in the entire world. Only a little flower of new
culture has been discovered in Russia on the shores of the Arctic Ocean."

...

Mao was no fervent believer. This absence of heartfelt commitment
would result in a most unconventional and unusual relationship with his
Party throughout his life, even when he was the head of that Party.


Interesting... so Mao wasn't a "true believer" of communism?  maybe just liked the attention?


...


Writing to a friend in November 1920, in which he com-
plained about his own conditions as an intellectual, he remarked: "I think
labourers in China do not really suffer poor physical conditions. Only
scholars suffer."


...


Mao did not believe in his tiny Party's prospects, or that communism
had any broad appeal. He made this crystal-clear at the CCP's 3rd
Congress in June 1923. The only hope of creating a Communist China, he
said, was by means of a Russian invasion. Mao "was so pessimistic,"
Maring (who chaired the congress) reported, "that he saw the only salvation of China in the intervention by Russia," telling the congress "that the
revolution had to be brought into China from the north by the Russian
army" This was in essence what happened two decades later.
His enthusiasm for the Moscow line shot Mao into the core of the
Party; under Maring. There he exerted himself as never before, now that
he could see hope in what he was doing. Moscow's chief bagman in China,
Vilde, who doubled as the Soviet vice-consul in Shanghai, singled out Mao
and one other person in a report to Moscow as "most definitel good
cadres." Mao was appointed the assistant to Party chief Professor Ch'en,
with responsibility for correspondence, documents and taking the min-
utes at meetings. All Party letters had to be co-signed by him and Ch'en.
In imitation of Ch'en, Mao signed with an English signature: T. T. Mao.
One of the first things Ch'en and he did was to write to Moscow for more
money-"now that our work front is expanding."


...


Mao did not organise any peasant action in the style of poor versus
rich. This was partly because he thought it was pointless. He had told
Borodin and some other Communists before, on 18 January 1924:
if we carry out struggles against big landlords, we are bound to fail.
[In some areas, some Communists] organised the illiterate peasants
first, then led them in struggles against relatively rich and big land-
lords. What was the result? Our organisations were immediately bro-
ken, banned, and these peasants not only did not regard us as fighting
for their interests, they hated us, saying that if we hadn't organised
them, there would not have been disasters, or misfortune.
Therefore, until we are confident that our grassroots branches in
the countryside are strong . . . we cannot adopt the policy of taking
drastic steps against relatively rich landowners.
Mao was being pragmatic. A Communist called Wang Hsien-tsung in
Mao's area was organising poor peasants to improve their lot at the time
when Mao was in Shaoshan. He was accused of being a bandit, and was
arrested, tortured and beheaded by the local police.


...


On the eve of his departure from Changsha, Mao took a stroll along
the Xiang River, and wrote a poem in which he looked to the future:
Eagles soar up the long vault,
Fish fly down the shallow riverbed,
Under a sky offrost, ten thousand creatures vie to impose their will.
Touched by this vastness,
I ask the boundless earth:
who after all will be your master;>
Mao's nose did not fail him. Within two weeks of arriving in Canton, in
September 1925, he was given a clutch of key jobs by the Nationalist chief
Mao was to be Wang Ching-wei's stand-in, running the Propaganda
Department, as well as editor of the Nationalists' new journal, Politics
Weekly. And to underline his prominence, he also sat on the five-man com-
mittee vetting delegates for the Nationalists' second congress the follow-
ing Janua at which he delivered one of the major reports. Wang's role in
Mao's rise is something which has been sedulously obscured by Peking, all
the more so because Wang became the head of the Japanese puppet gov-
ernment in the 1940s.

...

Now Mao ordered the detainees to be released. A revolution was not like a dinner
par he admonished the locals; it needed violence. "It is necessary to
bring about a . . . reign of terror in every county:" Hunan's peasant

...

What fascinated Mao was violence that smashed the social order. And
it was this propensity that caught Moscow's eye, as it fitted into the Soviet
model of a social revolution. Mao was now published for the first time in
the Comintern journal,

...


One text that
Mao selected to guide his trainees described peasant association activists
discussing ways to deal with their victims. If they were "stubborn," "we'll
slit their ankle tendons and cut off their ears." The author greeted the
punishments, in particular this gruesome one, with rapture: "I had been
listening so absorbedly as if in a drunken stupor or trance. Now I was sud-
denly woken up by the yelling of 'Wonderful,' and I too couldn't help
bursting out 'Wonderful!'" This account was extraordinarily similar to
Mao's own report, both in style and language, and was most likely written by Mao himself.

...

pg 94


Jiangxi men left town and moved across the River Gan to put themselves
out of Mao's reach. They sent out a circular with this description of Mao:
He is extremely devious and sl selfish, and full of megalomania. To his
comrades, he orders them around, frightens them with charges of
crimes, and victimises them. He rarely holds discussions about Party
matters . . . Whenever he expresses a vie everyone must agree, other-
wise he uses the Party organisation to clamp down on you, or invents
some trumped-up theories to make life absolutely dreadful for you. . .
Mao always uses political accusations to strike at comrades. His cus-
tomary method regarding cadres is to . . . use them as his personal tools.
To sum up . . . not only is he not a revolutionary leader, he is not a . . .
Bolshevik.
Mao's goal, they said, was to "become Party Emperor."

...

pg 268

IT WAS THROUGH the Yenan Terror that Mao accomplished another
most important goal: building up his own personality cult. People who
lived through this period all remembered it as a turning point when they
"firmly established in our minds that Chairman Mao is our only wise
leader." Till then it had been possible to admire Mao while having reserva-
tions about him, and to gossip about his marriage to Jiang QLng while still
supporting him as the leader. When they were first told to "study" a Mao
speech, many had responded with an audible groan: "the same old thing,"
"can't be bothered to go over it again," "too simplistic." ite a few had
been reluctant to chant "Long live Chairman Mao." One recalled thinking:
"This was a slogan for emperors. Why are we doing this? I felt creepy
and refused to shout it." This kind of independent talk-and thinking-
was killed off by the campaign, and the deification of Mao established.
This worship had nothing to do with spontaneous popularity; it stemmed
from terror.
Every step in the construction of his cult was choreographed by Mao
himself He minutely controlled its main vehicle, Liberation Daily, using
giant headlines like "Comrade Mao Tse-tung is the Saviour of the Chinese
People!" And it was Mao who initiated the phenomenon of badges of his
head, which he first issued to the elite during the campaign. In 1943 he got
a huge head of himself carved in gold relief on the fac;ade of a major audi-
torium. It was in that year that Mao's portraits were first printed en masse
and sold to private homes, and that the Mao anthem, "The East Is Red,"
became a household song.
It was also in 1943 that a later widely used expression, "Mao Tse-tung
Thought," first saw the light of da in an article by the Red Pro£ Wang
Jia-xiang. Mao stage-managed this eulogy himself The Red Prof's wife
described how Mao dropped in one sunny day when the dates were green
on the trees. After some banter about mah-jong, Mao asked her husband
to write an article to commemorate the twenty-second anniversary of the
Party that Jul dropping heavy hints as to what it should say: Mao checked
the final text and made it obligatory reading for all.
Every da at the interminable meetings, Mao's simplistic formula was
hammered in: for everything wrong in the Par blame others; for every
success-himself To achieve this end, history was rewritten, and indeed
often stood on its head. The battle of Tucheng, the biggest disaster on the
Long March, fought under Mao's command, was now cited as an example
of what happened when the army "violated Mao Tse-tung's principles."
The first action against Japan, Pingxingguan, was credited to Mao,
although it had been fought against his wishes. "Just make it clear to Party
members and cadres that the leadership headed by Comrade Mao Tse-
tung is completely correct," Mao instructed.*

...

pg 466

ANOTHER FIASCO THAT drained the peasants' ener and brought
disaster, was an order from Mao that the entire nation had to "make steel."
The Superpower Programme needed a lot of steel-and steel was also
Mao's yardstick for superpower status. When he boasted to Communist
leaders in Moscow in 1957 that China would "overtake Britain in fifteen
years" (which he later shortened to three) and when he told the Chinese he
was fully confident that China could "overtake America" in ten years, steel
output was what he had in mind. Mao set the 1958 target at 10.7 million
tons. How this came about illustrates his broad-brush approach to eco-
nomics. Sitting by his swimming pool in Zhongnanhai on 19 June he said to
the metallurgy minister: "Last year, steel output was 5 3 million tons. Can
you double it this year?" The yes-man said: "All right." And that was that.
Steel mills and related industries like coal mines were ordered to go flat
out to speed up production. Rules, and common sense, were cast aside.
Equipment was overworked to the point of breakdown, and over 30,000
workers were killed in serious accidents alone within a few months.
Experts who tried to talk sense were persecuted. Mao set the tone for dis-

crediting rationality by saying that "bourgeois professors' knowledge
should be treated as dogs' fart, worth nothing, deserving only disdain,
"
scorn, contempt. . .
Even going flat out, the existing steel mills could not fulfil Mao's target.
His response was to order the general population to build "backyard
furnaces." At least 90 million people were "forced," as Mao said matter-
of-factl to construct such furnaces, which Khrushchev not unfairly
dubbed "samovar" furnaces, and which produced not steel at all, but pig
iron, if that.
To feed these furnaces, the population was coerced into donating vir-
tually every piece of metal they had, regardless of whether this was being
used in productive, even essential, objects. Farm tools, even water wagons,
were carted off and melted down, as were cooking utensils, iron door han-
dles and women's hair-clips. The regime slogan was: "To hand in one pick-
axe is to wipe out one imperialist, and to hide one nail is to hide one
coun te r - revolutionary"

	...Jiangxi men left town and moved across the River Gan to put themselves out of Mao's reach. They sent out a circular with this description of Mao:
		He is extremely devious and sly, selfish, and full of megalomania. To his comrades, he orders them around, frightens them with charges of crimes, and victimises them. He rarely holds discussions about Party matters . . . Whenever he expresses a view, everyone must agree, otherwise he uses the Party organisation to clamp down on you, or invents some trumped-up theories to make life absolutely dreadful for you. . .Mao always uses political accusations to strike at comrades. His customary method regarding cadres is to . . . use them as his personal tools. To sum up . . . not only is he not a revolutionary leader, he is not a . . . Bolshevik. Mao's goal, they said, was to "become Party Emperor."

    I honor Lenin as a man who completely sacrificed himself and devoted all his energy to the realization of social justice. I do not consider his methods practical, but one thing is certain: men of his type are the guardians and restorers of humanity.
        Albert Einstein, as quoted in Einstein and the Generations of Science (p.25) by Lewis Samuel Feuerl.

weird. Einstein one of them? he did write FDR urging him to build the bomb

There are no morals in politics; there is only expedience. A scoundrel may be of use to us just because he is a scoundrel. --Lenin


Young Stalin:

How Okhrana recruited: Alliluyev Memoirs, pp. 43–45. Agents in Bolsheviks and how Okhrana spread suspicion deliberately: Daly, Watchful State, pp. 95,106 and 117; killing informants the duty of honest person says Lenin, p. 37.


	A major piece of evidence that Stalin was an Okhrana agent was a probable forgery, the so-called Eremin Letter, that appeared in the 1920s and was published by Life magazine in the 1950s, forming the backbone of the conspiracy-theory books by I. D. Levine and E. E. Smith. Colonel Eremin was indeed the head of the Tiflis Okhrana from February 1908. The letter was clearly drafted by someone who knew a lot about Stalin and the Okhrana, but it contained a series of mistakes of detail. While appreciating Stalin’s amorality, it also grasped his devotion to the cause, claiming that he was an unsatisfactory agent because in the end he was a fanatical Marxist. When the Eremin Letter was published in Life after Stalin’s death, his successor, First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, and the Politburo ordered the KGB Chairman, General Serov, to analyse its veracity. His investigations, recently found in the archives, also conclude that it was a forgery. As for the theory that the Great Terror was Stalin’s effort to suppress evidence of his Okhrana links, The Secret File of Joseph Stalin by Roman Brackman (2001) puts the argument robustly.

interesting

	Stalin’s friend from Tiflis, Kalinin, was not promoted to the CC because he was temporarily suspected of being an Okhrana double-agent: the Bolsheviks, even while being betrayed by Malinovsky at the very heart of the Party, suspected an innocent comrade.

says he was innocent?

kindof mirrors the wikipedia article (Mallinsky was *the* Okhrana agent)

seems like just about all of them were Okhrana agents...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_warfare
	Political warfare is the use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will, based on hostile intent. The term political describes the calculated interaction between a government and a target audience to include another state's government, military, and/or general population. Governments use a variety of techniques to coerce certain actions, thereby gaining relative advantage over an opponent. The techniques include propaganda and psychological operations (PSYOP), which service national and military objectives respectively. Propaganda has many aspects and a hostile and coercive political purpose. Psychological operations are for strategic and tactical military objectives and may be intended for hostile military and civilian populations.

Political warfare's coercive nature leads to weakening or destroying an opponent's political, social, or societal will, and forcing a course of action favorable to a state's interest. Political war may be combined with violence, economic pressure, subversion, and diplomacy, but its chief aspect is "the use of words, images and ideas". The creation, deployment, and continuation of these coercive methods are a function of statecraft for nations and serve as a potential substitute for more direct military action.

	...Communist strategy and tactics continually focused on revolutionary objectives, "for them the real war is the political warfare waged daily under the guise of peace". the purpose of which is to "disorient and disarm the opposition...to induce the desire to surrender in opposing peoples...to corrode the entire moral, political, and economic infrastructure of a nation". Lenin's mastery of "politics and struggle", remained objectives for the Soviet Union

	War and Revolution
	A LECTURE DELIVERED MAY 14 (27), 1917

	We all know the dictum of Clausewitz, one of the most famous writers on the philosophy and history of war, which says: “War is a continuation of policy by other means.” This dictum comes from a writer who reviewed the history of wars and drew philosophic lessons from it shortly after the period of the Napoleonic wars. This writer, whose basic views are now undoubtedly familiar to every thinking person, nearly eighty years ago challenged the ignorant man-in-the-street conception of war as being a thing apart from the policies of the governments and classes concerned, as being a simple attack that disturbs the peace, and is then followed by restoration of the peace thus disturbed, as much as to say: “They had a fight, then they made up!” This is a grossly ignorant view, one that was repudiated scores of years ago and is repudiated by any more or less careful analysis of any historical epoch of wars.

	War is a continuation of policy by other means. All wars are inseparable from the political systems that engender them. The policy which a given state, a given class within that state, pursued for a long time before the war is inevitably continued by that same class during the war, the form of action alone being changed.

	By winter 1958, some mess halls in the communes had run out of food, leading to outward migration oedema, and abnormal deaths. Peasants were fleeing, begging, and battling for food. By early 1958, spring famine had already occurred

	...Mao thought that the food shortage problem was restricted to only a few provinces,and transfers from the centre or from other provinces would take care of the problem. ...Back in 1958, before Mao made the authoritative decision, there was nothing the other leaders could do.

	...ideology was enlisted to legitimize current policies. ...The primary reason why some places had not boosted production was that leaders there were either 'capitalist elements' or 'rightist conservatives.' Only when 'unrelentless struggles were carried out against these leaders resulting in their resignation', had the high tide for production emerged.

	Liu Shao-chi, greeting the conference on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave the meaning of last year's victory. "In agriculture," he said, "we have found the way to develop production at high speed, begun to to change its backward condition and doubled the output of grain, cotton and some other crops. It must be considered a great achievement that the annual output of grain reached about 1,200 jin per capita in a country as big and populous as ours."

	Yet, the MA never wavered from pushing Mao's every preference. Sometime in September, Mao said that it was fundamentally wrong to run agricultural and forestry academies in the cities, as the students should integrate themselves with the peasants in order to 'toil hard' for three years. The MA took this seriously, so between 20 and 30 September it convened a national conference on combining education with labour, and decided that all students and staff of all agricultural academies should be sent into the countryside for labour training. Immediately after the conferences, 47,000 teachers and students from 28 academies were sent to the villages, ranches, and factories as labour.

	The Chinese peasants, in reaping bumper crops last year, made valuable contributions to science by exploding out-moded theories, said Kuo Mo-jo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in his greeting to the conference. The steps for raising farm output centering on deep ploughing, opened out a new road for scientific study of soils, plant physiology, crops cultivation and related fields. The record crops show that the rich experience of the Chinese peasants, accumulated over centuries of practical activity, is an ocean of wisdom, an inexhaustible mine of knowledge. Science today is no longer the monopoly of the few, Kuo Mo-jo continued, and the bumper-crops are a result partly of the fact that the masses have begun to master science.

	At the initial stage of communization in early September, Tan Zhenlin reassured Mao with a rosy report that claimed that communes had been formed rapidly and smoothly, and that only in a minority of places had the peasants resorted to slaughtering and selling of livestock, felling trees, and grain concealment.

	They were urged to eat their fill as China would soon by overflowing with food. Minister of Agriculture Tan Zhenlin asked, 'After all, what does Communism mean? ...First, taking good food and not merely eating one's fill. At each meal one enjoys a meat diet, eating chicken, pork, fish, eggs.'

	However, an anonymous letter dated 5 September reached Mao in early October informing him that food shortages at several xiang in Anhui had killed over 500 people, and that many had become ill. The food shortages were attributed to natural calamities, false-reporting, and administrative commands which forced the conversion of dry land into rice paddies.

Russian ownership of a large portion of a U.S.-based oil company would be unprecedented, according to experts contacted by CBS News. Those experts also emphasize that the White House has the power to block the deal -- either on national security grounds or simply by leaving in place Obama administration sanctions against Russia.

Menendez, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he is concerned that a deal struck on Nov. 30 between Rosneft and PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, means the Russian company will ultimately claim at least 49.9 percent of U.S. oil company Citgo. Rosneft’s CEO Igor Sechin is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies.

Even if the sanctions are lifted, allowing Rosneft to seize Citgo, with its three refineries and oil transport infrastructure, there is the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, as CBS notes in its analysis of the Rosneft-Citgo situation. The committee’s task is to review the national security implications of foreign investments in the country. Given this focus and the current temperature of U.S.-Russian relations, it’s difficult to believe the committee would greenlight such a deal.

"Recently some foreign media have been spreading rumors on a deal between Russia and the West on ‘Crimea in exchange for lifting sanctions’ formula. This is a complete fabrication," Matvienko posted in her blog on the website of the Federation Council.

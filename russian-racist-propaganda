Now they are embraced as partners who can help further Russia’s interests and who share key views–advocacy of traditional family values, belief in authoritarian leadership, a distrust of the U.S. and support for strong law-and-order measures.

Russia offers friendship with a world power. Le Pen and other party officials visit Moscow repeatedly, and Russian guests at the party’s congress this month included Andrei Isayev, a deputy speaker of the Russian parliament’s lower house.

At a rally last week near the Palace of Versailles, France’s largest far-right party, the National Front, deployed all the familiar theatrics and populist themes of nationalist movements across Europe.

A standing-room-only crowd waved the national flag, joined in a boisterous singing of the national anthem and applauded as speakers denounced freeloading foreigners and, with particular venom, the European Union.

But the event, part of an energetic push for votes by France’s surging far right ahead of elections this week for the European Parliament, also promoted an agenda distant from the customary concerns of conservative voters: why Europe needs to break its “submission” to the United States and look to Russia as a force for peace and a bulwark against moral decay.

How Russia Deals with Immigrants

Americans have something to learn.

White people in the former Warsaw Pact countries still cherish their racial and cultural identities, and their politicians and citizens are trying to keep immigrants out. Even if we in America and Western Europe become extensions of the Third World, the countries behind the Iron Curtain will still be European.

MAGILEVKA, RUSSIA—A trespasser appeared in Boris Matrinitski’s front yard one morning in early January: A middle-aged Chinese man, wearing an old uniform, trudging through the deep snow. The man wasn’t carrying any bags and didn’t seem dressed for the cold.

In another place, in another time, Mr. Matrinitski might have offered him shelter.

But this village of Magilevka is just a few kilometres north of the Ussuri River, which separates China from the vast wilderness of Russia’s Far East. Thousands of illegal migrants cross the river every year and the Russian government has become deeply concerned about defending its territory.

Mr. Matrinitski rushed outside and tackled the Chinese man. He restrained his captive and called the border guards, who took him away.

It’s not common for Russian villagers to physically throw themselves at people they suspect of being illegal immigrants. But Mr. Matrinitski is a Cossack, a descendant of the horsemen who defended Russia’s borders for centuries, and the Kremlin has recently taken steps to revive the Cossacks’ warrior spirit.

“Boris reacted honourably,” said Georgy Torhov, 67, commander of Mr. Matrinitski and hundreds of other Cossacks around this village. “This interloper was stopped within the first 24 hours. But we need to react even faster.”

LOL

Those may seem like unusual fears for Russia, which still has enough nuclear, biological and chemical weapons to theoretically kill everyone on the planet. But Russia’s conventional military has dwindled, along with its shrinking population.

lolol

were they messing around with this one?

 Stories of white identity and black hostility.

...

One afternoon as I dozed off, I was startled by clouds of acrid smoke rising from the floor next to me. There, squatted next to my neighbor’s bed, was a grotesque semi-naked figure, festooned in rattling cowry shells, with shriveled eagle talons and tortoise shells, dried snakes and feathers strung around his scrawny neck, a starkly white painted face, arms and legs covered in red and blue ochre smears, a jockstrap pulled tight between his wasted thighs.

I reached for the nurses’ bell, and minutes later the black supervisor arrived.

I had a litany of complaints: violating sterility, general unhygienic practice, anthrax from dead wild animals, stench, danger of open fires near oxygen tanks, rampant bacteria. . . .

The supervisor archly reminded me that “traditional medicine” was now officially legalized. Witchdoctors (now called healers) routinely called on and treated their patients in well-equipped first-world facilities.

My complaint was dismissed as “racist and unconstitutional.”

That was the moment I graduated from being a long-suffering, silent, liberal-minded white South African to a firm believer in racial reality.

How I Learned About Blacks: Being a landlord in the ghetto is a quick education.

Why was I collecting rent in the first place rather than have tenants mail checks? Most blacks don’t have checking accounts, and even if they do, after a few bounced checks you just ask for cash. Section 8 tenants always make their deposits in cash. If you ask any inner-city merchant or repairman, he will tell you blacks mostly pay cash. Part of it is that they just don’t trust banks.

The various organs of the Deep State, including the corporate media, work hard to convince the public that the Deep State does not exist. (Kind of like that story about the Devil.) In fact, the Deep State runs the show. “The truth is that an oligarchy rules, and makes war on whomever it chooses -- internationally and domestically -- for the benefit of corporate capital.” It has neutralized a sitting president, less than two months in office.

The Deep State is busy denying that it exists, even as it savages a sitting president and brutally bitch-slaps its host society, demanding the nation embrace its role as global psycho thug and kick some Russian ass. 


...

At this stage of capitalism, the U.S. ruling class has less and less use for the conventional operations of the bourgeois state. It cannot govern in the old way. More and more, it seeks to shape events through the levers of the collaborating networks of the Deep State. It’s number one global priority is to continue the military offensive begun in 2011, and to break Russia’s resolve to resist that offensive. 


https://blackagendareport.com/us_fixed_russian_election_1996

The U.S. is the unchallenged champion of hijacking, fixing and subverting elections around the world. On every inhabitable continent – from Italy to Iran to Accra to Tegucigalpa -- Washington has stolen people’s rights to elected leaders of their choice. Only two decades ago, Bill Clinton and his operatives were busy stealing Russia’s first post-Soviet elections. But, U.S. corporate media seem to have forgotten such inconvenient facts.

There is still no evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election. What substitutes for proof is nothing but an endless loop of corporate media repetition. The Democratic Party has plenty of reason to whip up hysteria in an effort to divert attention from its endless electoral debacles.

The American impulse to control or crush the rest of the world is thwarted by an independent Russia. While Americans are fed an endless diet of xenophobia Russia and China continue their New Silk Road economic partnership. Of course this alliance is born of the necessity to protect against American threats but no one reading the New York Times or Washington Post knows anything about it. Nor do they know that Vladimir Putin’s mentor stayed in power because of Bill Clinton’s meddling.

Don't believe the Russia hype: Who profits from the new Red Scare?

Donald Trump's unforeseen victory in the 2016 elections has infected US politics with a heavy strand of anti-Russia hysteria. Yet it is not the President-elect who has been the source of the anti-Russia war campaign. Trump has expressed a willingness to develop a more peaceful set of relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This has thrown the imperialist system into a panic, especially the Democratic Party. The ruling class loyal to the Democrats has used Trump as an excuse to blame Russia for Hillary Clinton's defeat and distract the public from the real enemy of humanity: US imperialism.


https://www.blackagendareport.com/trump_russia_perfect_lie
Having lost, the Democratic Party and their media cohorts continue the effort to make trouble for another nation whose only crime is the pursuit of its own interests. The anti-Russia strategy also distracts the Democratic rank and file. They ought to be angry that their standard bearer and their party leadership lost an election because of corruption, hubris and incompetence but instead they are taken in by propaganda.


https://www.blackagendareport.com/dems_stir_war_to_turn_election
The orchestrators of the anti-Russian war hysteria “have shown over the past several weeks that they are willing, and even eager, to bring down the whole edifice of U.S. social and political ‘checks and balances’ -- freedom of speech and other civil liberties -- to sustain the momentum of their neoliberal offensive in the world.” White Republicans stole the election, as usual, not Russians.


...

Like a gyroscope gone out of whack, the destabilized U.S. duopoly system is spinning out of control on a course to self-destruction. In a breathtaking rush to they-know-not-where, the Democrats have deliberately whipped up an anti-Russian war hysteria not experienced in three generations. The Russians, however, have virtually nothing to do with the crisis, which is very soon likely to degenerate into something resembling civil war at home.


https://blackagendareport.com/regime_change_forces_desperate
War Democrats and Republicans care only about maintaining imperialism -- through lies and repression. The bipartisan War Party is desperate to continue its regime change policies and foil improved relations with Russia.

...

The American corporate media ignored the suffering of Syrians in the city of Aleppo until their captivity was broken by the Syrian Arab Army. Ever since 2012 ISIS and other terrorist groups sponsored by the United States, NATO, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have held thousands of people hostage there. Turks picked the region apart, raiding Syrian factories and transporting them piece by piece back to their country.

Now that the Syrians are retaking the city with the help of their Russian and Hezbollah allies, there is a steady stream of news about the Aleppo. All of it is meant to pull at the heart strings of uninformed people as the human rights industrial complex reliably goes about its dirty work. Human Rights Watch and other groups who work to promote United States foreign policy speak endlessly about war crimes. They didn’t say much when America’s allies were terrorizing Syrians but now they suddenly point fingers and always at the people who run afoul of regime change plans.

...

The Syrian government is determined to take back its country and the Americans and their allies are equally determined to thwart it. The recent successes of the Syrian army explain part of the desperation coming from Obama, the Democratic Party and corporate media. Blaming Russia kills several birds with one stone. It continues the propaganda war against a country that will not knuckle under and accept American hegemony.

The new release from Wikileaks shows the CIA has all the tools it needs to leave “Russian” footprints behind its own hacking jobs.

Other critics have complained about its historical inadequacies, such as the ability of Django, masquerading as a freed slave, to sit at a table with whites in Mississippi and enjoy other social amenities that would have been unheard of at the time—and which are problematic even today in the U.S.

https://www.blackagendareport.com/content/deja-vu-progressives-sleeping-racists
But creating the diversion of race is very easy, accomplished by playing on the belief developed over 500 years of slavery that whites are superior to blacks, and that black people are inherently scary and dangerous. It's used to provoke fear, hatred and anger, and to prevent blacks and whites from uniting to seek out the real tyrants and criminals. What's being presented to us as the problem is actually only a curtain behind which hides the appropriate target of our anger, the White Wizards of the Oligarchy, their transnational corporations, their lobbyist lackeys and their congressional, judicial and presidential marionettes. In other words, the real threat to our neighborhoods "doesn't wear a hoodie. It flies a corporate jet." (R.J. Eskow)

Today, the master-slave relationship of the plantation has been replaced by the business-worker relationship of the transnational corporation. And while slavery is usually thought of in moral terms, it is, in fact, an economic relationship, a very profitable economic relationship. (9)
But the majority of white people enmeshed in this system, like the black designees of subordinate status, were the tools that built the national economy, although the vast majority of the wealth they created flowed upward, to the top of the white social pyramid. The whites left at the bottom were made to understand they'd better be content with their lot, because "at least they weren't black." And the white middle class, with their "fear of falling" into the lower classes could, for the most part, reliably be counted on to see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. In essence, white people are offered supremacy among the peasants in exchange for their passivity.


...


"...notions of colorblindness and a post-racial society, are a convenient obfuscation that allows white Americans to ignore the situational and individual ideologies, practices and policies that cripple any viable notion of justice and democracy." (This is a direct legacy of slavery and the invention of the white race.) (31)

The tolerance that remains is the tolerance of the white middle class, liberal/progressive buffer, which is itself now circling the bowl. And the longer they sit, refusing to take sides, or to even admit there's a side to take, the longer they aid and abet what's being done to minorities, the more explosive the situation gets.

...

So a cross-class alliance between rich English colonists and poor English colonists created the club known as the “white race.” It was designed as a social control structure in which the poor, by accepting the crumbs of slightly less exploitation from the table of the Rich, became the cheerleaders of their oppressors rather than the brothers and sisters of the rest of humanity. The club expanded to include other European ethnicities as Northern industrialists used immigration to power their rise to the top of the financial heap.

"What is most important for white folks to understand is that our interests do not lie with the racial bonding we are being asked to embrace. Indeed, the very concept of the white race was invented by the wealthy so as to trick poor and working class European Americans into accepting an economic system that exploited them, even as it elevated them in relative terms over persons of color. ... And to organize on the basis of whiteness is to cast one’s lot with the elite, who desperately wish for working class people to believe their enemies are each other, rather than the bosses who cut their wages, raid their pension funds, and limit their health care coverage.

And I remembered reading a few years ago one scholar's survey of Black history and his being intrigued by "the extent to which African Americans have fantasized about political violence - specifically, violent revolt" as a matter of political "instrument" or "catharsis."  He surveyed a swath of Black writing which in poem, novel or political statement included many references to what some Europeans have called "divine violence."  Frederick Douglas, DuBois, Langston Hughes, Ida B. Wells, Robert Williams, Sonya Sanchez and Jeru the Damaja were all referenced as having at one time or another, in one way or another, described acts of violence as just, even necessary.  He quoted Nikki Giovanni's lines, "What can I, a poor black woman do to destroy America? This is the question, with appropriate variations, being asked in every black heart. There is one answer-I can kill.

...But none were forgetting the fundamentality of our rage against the very nature of the state's relationship to Black people.  Malcolm X once said that simply being Black in America "radicalizes you."  We hope so because it certainly does continue to enrage.

The principle of subversion was formulated by a Chinese philosopher 2,500 years ago. Sun Tzu said, “All warfare is based primarily on deception of your enemy. To fight on the battlefield to achieve your goals is the most primitive and barbaric [way] to achieve your goals. The highest art of war is not to fight at all, but to subvert anything of value in your enemy’s country.” Which includes religion, moral principles, traditions, and natural[ly] established relationships between people, families, groups, classes, races. Turn the blacks against the whites; turn the teachers against students; turn Ralph Nader against the government; labor unions against business; homosexuals against heterosexuals; and keep on fighting, my dear friends, until you demoralize and destabilize yourself, and then you flop like a rotten apple and the enemy will take you over. You will invite the enemy.

 The presence of an opposing worldview
may, therefore, lead people to b
ecome  extremely  defensive  about  their
ideologies; at that moment, they are protecting not only their own beliefs
but also the integrity of the shared re
ality on which their valued relation-
ships  are  based.  This  fact  may  help  
to  explain  the  fierceness  with  which
individuals and groups strive to avoid, repel, and even eradicate those who
endorse  competing  ideological  convic
tions  (e.g.,  Bar-Tal,  1998;  Green,
Abelson, & Garnett, 1999; Tindale, 
Munier, Wasserman, & Smith, 2002).
Social  conflicts  such  as  the  Israeli–
Palestinian  conflict  and  the  current
tensions  between  the  USA  and  much  
of  the  Muslim  world  may  arise  in
part  because  of  the  threat  that  is  in
herent  in  the  existence  of  competing
worldviews  and  the  motivation  to  defend  and  protect  existing  social
networks,  relationships,  and  the  ideo
logies  on  which  those  relationships
are  predicated.  In  other  words,  the  mere  existence  of  an  alternative
worldview may challenge the shared set 
of beliefs that constitute the very
foundation  of  people’s  connections  to  their  family,  friends,  and  social
groups.

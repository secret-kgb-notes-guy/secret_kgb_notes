It’s required reading, especially for those who have convinced themselves that the presidential campaign is nothing more than a contest to see who can sustain the rudest diatribe against Donald Trump.  General Pacepa thinks it’s really about a mortal threat to America’s uniquely successful democratic capitalism, and he provides a detailed history of international Communism to prove his point.  He’s all for Trump:

    We are not personally acquainted with Donald Trump, but we firmly believe that the whole of America – Republicans and Democrats and fringe thinkers – should unite behind him in order to defend capitalism and our great country during these existentially dangerous times. The alternative is unthinkable.


??? Pacepa is for Trump? seems kindof weird?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Mihai_Pacepa
Pacepa is a columnist for the Internet conservative blog site PJ Media. He also occasionally writes articles for The Wall Street Journal and various American conservative publications, such as National Review Online, The Washington Times, the online newspaper FrontPage Magazine and the WorldNet Daily.

And he writes for PJ media?

something seems off about this... what's up with Pacepa?

So far seems like older information is accurate, newer is not? did the KGB turn him back? (maybe after Yeltsin?)


on Mihai Pacepa supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In opposition, large anti-war demonstrations were held in cities across the world. Pacepa contends that these protests were contrived and anti-American, which Russia assisted

hmmm




Financial PR firms and hired influencers help the Kremlin’s cause by arguing that “finance and politics should be kept separate.” But whereas the liberal idea of globalization sees money as politically neutral, with global commerce leading to peace and interdependence, the Kremlin uses the openness of global markets as an opportunity to employ money, commerce and energy as foreign policy weapons.

    The government’s application for the surveillance order targeting Page included a lengthy declaration that laid out investigators’ basis for believing that Page was an agent of the Russian government and knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow, officials said.

Here's one Trump advisor confirmed as a Russian spy.

They even got a FISA warrant for him. Anybody else want to whine and cry about "politically motivated  wiretapping" against the poor, innocent Trump camp?

On that note, you should call Nunes to testify in the hearings on Russia's activities.

Did the Okhrana back the Bolsheviks?

They used fear of Russian revolutionaries in France to "ally" Russian and France, while more and more revolutionaries kept showing up, then France helped create the soviet union.

So they could keep sending "revolutionaries" and be like "oh we can help you catch them... if you just share intelligence with us and let us set up camp..." so they could control both sides of the takeover that way.


https://www.henrymakow.com/001836.html

??? they behind the Spanish Flu too?

If they had the mindset of "cripple Europe as much as possible" then sure


But the whole Bolshevik revolution could have just been an intelligence coup. They might have figured communism would be a useful ideology to justify state control and give them more power. That could be why they wanted world war one--Europe disliked communism and would have supported the Czar, but with the war they were distracted fighting each other instead.

But America threw a wrench in their plans somewhat. So that could be why they see America as "the enemy", since America thwarted their plans to consolidate even more power.

Then they filled America with spies and tried again with WW2 to expand the Soviet Union, and when that became a stalemate they did peristroika to try again today.

The whole thing is just a crazy secretive cult bent on world domination. They just do divide and conquer with influence agents over and over again. Foment world chaos and grab power.

Saying 90% of Chinese like Putin? seems like another pro-Putin peice

	Putin revitalized the country, the style of toughness in line with China's nationalist sentiment

	Putin boycotted the West also coincides with the psychology of the Chinese people

	...So not only the media mislead the people, the people also based on their own needs to choose to select Putin

	As mentioned earlier, the Chinese media did not present a complete Putin. 

hmm that sounds familiar...

	After a series of turmoil, on March 18 this year, the Crimea region was incorporated into Russia. "Today we have to open the skylight to speak," Putin said in a speech at the national parliament, "Today we have to open the skylight and say" "Western partners have played, and we have our own position. "We are being deceived again and again, others are behind us to make decisions for us, leaving us are fait accompli." Putin vowed to end this history, his speech from time to time by the participants all cheered, applause Cheers and tears interrupted.

	March 20, the Russian public opinion research center released poll data show that Putin's support rate increased by 15.1% to 75.7%, a record five-year high. 63% of the respondents believe that Putin's most recognized work in the near future is dealing with the situation in Ukraine. In the eyes of many Russians, Putin is not only a wrist leader, but also a recovery of lost national hero.

	And even some European and American media also exclaimed "the Russian Empire back", there are many people pointed out that the European political are many leaders are "general" and "fans". In the face of Putin's stance, some people are skeptical about the effect of sanctions that are about to begin in Europe and America.

Russia attacking hospitals?

	Nigel Inkster, former director of operations and intelligence for MI6, told Sky News that one of the reasons the NHS in particular was vulnerable was its outdated software system. “A lot of hospital trusts in the U.K. — 40-plus last time I checked — are running their systems on Windows XP software, which hasn’t been supported by Microsoft for two or three years,” he said. “In other words, Microsoft is no longer looking for and seeking to repair vulnerabilities in the system.”

	Cybersecurity experts said the malicious software works by exploiting a flaw in Microsoft software that was described in NSA documents stolen from the agency and leaked publicly in April by a criminal group called Shadow Brokers.

	Malicious software that blocks access to computers is spreading swiftly across the world, snarling critical systems in hospitals, telecommunications and corporate offices with the help of a software vulnerability originally discovered by the National Security Agency.

	...The ransomware locks computers and then launches a ransom note in a text file, according to researchers at the Avast security software company in the Czech Republic. The note says that “you need to pay service fees for the decryption” and asks for $300 worth of bitcoin to be sent electronically to an address.


https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-06/russian-hackers-said-to-seek-hush-money-from-liberal-u-s-groups
	Russian hackers are targeting U.S. progressive groups in a new wave of attacks, scouring the organizations’ emails for embarrassing details and attempting to extract hush money, according to two people familiar with probes being conducted by the FBI and private security firms.

	At least a dozen groups have faced extortion attempts since the U.S. presidential election, said the people, who provided broad outlines of the campaign. The ransom demands are accompanied by samples of sensitive data in the hackers’ possession.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hospitals-across-england-report-it-failure-amid-suspected-major-cyber-attack/2017/05/12/84e3dc5e-3723-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html
	Officials made no public comment on the possible source of the hack, which touched off havoc and confusion across the state-run health system. Operations were canceled, emergency room services were scaled down, and medical personnel went back to using handwritten notes.

	Health officials offered no indication of when services might return to normal, or whether patient records could be permanently lost to the attack.

	“The most exploitable industry in the world is the health-care sector,” said Tom Kellerman, chief executive of Strategic Cyber Ventures. He said the industry is chronically hobbled by regulation and insufficient investment in computer security.

	A statement from NHS Digital — the computer services arm of the health service — said at least 16 hospitals or doctor’s offices were directly affected by the attack. Officials later acknowledged the number was rising, though they did not give a precise figure.

	Other health-care centers, meanwhile, turned off their computers to avoid potential infiltration. NHS Digital said it did “not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed.”

	...Attacks on health-care systems can also be especially high-stakes, creating potential life-or-death situations and raising the chances that the victim will ultimately pay. 

	Signs hung on the door at the emergency ward at the Royal London Hospital Friday afternoon read: “The emergency department has no IT facilities” 

	...The attack in Britain had immediate impacts in hospitals across the country. 

	Richard Harvey, 50, was just about to undergo surgery Friday afternoon on his leg following a motorcycle accident when a nurse told him that the procedure had been canceled due to a cyberattack. 

	...Doctors were using pen and paper as the National Health Service struggled to get computers back online. Routine appointments were being canceled.

	In early April of 1979, a mysterious plague wafted through the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk, now known as Ekaterinburg. At least 66 people and an unknown number of animals were struck with a vague illness and then swiftly died. Soviet officials blamed tainted meat sold on the black market. But a 1992 investigation by a Harvard researcher finally aired the real killer: a plume of anthrax spores accidentally released from a clandestine bioweapons plant in town, known as Compound 19.

	It was one of the largest inhalation anthrax outbreaks in history—and one of the few traces of the Soviet’s secret dabbling in bioweapons research—all thanks to botched air filter maintenance. The slow-moving death cloud that seeped from the compromised ventilation system left a trail of carnage 30 miles downwind of Compound 19. If the breeze had blown directly toward the center of town, which sits about 230 miles north of Russia’s border with Kazakhstan, thousands could have been killed.

You can wait for the next big "bombshell leak" to the press, but what's a leak to the press going to accomplish if all we do is wait? Congress knows there are people in the Government, presumably pro-American, who are behind these leaks. Pick a Congressional hearing (e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/ or https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/) and just about every other paragraph is a flustered Congressman interrogating an intelligence official about "unmasking" and "illegal leaks." Congress knows the leakers will likely leak more. And yet, they have still chosen to side against our country.

	YATES: We told him ... the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others, because in the media accounts, it was clear from the vice president and others that they were repeating what General Flynn had told them, and that this was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information.

	And that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.

	...we were there to tell the White House about something we were very concerned about and emphasized to them repeatedly. It was so they could take action.

https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/19/15561842/trump-russia-louise-mensch
	The Russiasphere doesn’t have one unifying, worked-out theory — like “9/11 was an inside job” or “Nazi gas chambers are a hoax.” Instead, it’s more like an attitude — a general sense that Russian influence in the United States is pervasive and undercovered by the mainstream media. Everything that happens in US politics is understood through this lens — especially actions taken by the Trump administration, which is seen as Kremlin-occupied territory.


This intentional? could spread conspiracy theories to discredit people who are suspicious of Russian influence in general


	One of them is Schindler, the former NSA spook. A former Naval War College professor who resigned in 2014 after a scandal in which he sent a photograph of his penis to a Twitter follower, he thinks Mensch doesn’t get it right all the time. But he does think she was onto the truth about Trump and Russia “long before the MSM cared” (the two have been amiably chatting on Twitter since 2013).


I had figured Schindler was meant for bigger and better things? he is former NSA. Guy is too crazy though, so maybe they realized that?

	Claude Taylor is the third core member of the Russia sphere. He’s a DC-area photographer who claims to have worked for three presidential administrations; his role is to provide inside information into the alleged legal cases against the president. He also routinely claims to have advance knowledge what’s happening, even down to the precise number of grand juries impaneled and indictments that are on the way. 

	...They’re also reliably boosted by a few allies with large followings — conservative NeverTrumper Rick Wilson, the anonymous Twitter account Counterchekist, and financial analyst Eric Garland (best known as the “time for some game theory” tweetstormer.)


	For instance, after the New York Times published the Mensch piece back in March, former DNC chair Donna Brazile tweeted out the story, with a follow-up thanking Mensch for “good journalism”:

	Thank you for good journalism. https://t.co/0qtqD4u1Nu
	— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) March 18, 2017 


Interesting... Brazile got duped? or working for them?


	Two former Obama staffers, Ned Price and Eric Schultz, favorably discussed a Palmer Report story aggregating Mensch’s allegations about Chaffetz (“interesting, if single-source,” Price tweeted). Larry Tribe, an eminent and famous constitutional law professor at Harvard, shared the same Palmer Report story on Twitter — and even defended his decision to do so in an email to BuzzFeed’s Joseph Bernstein.

	“Some people regard a number of its stories as unreliable,” Tribe wrote of Palmer. Yet he defended disseminating its work: “When I share any story on Twitter ... I do so because a particular story seems to be potentially interesting, not with the implication that I’ve independently checked its accuracy or that I vouch for everything it asserts.”

	And Keith Olbermann made a popular video for GQ based on Taylor’s allegations about imminent arrests, adding that “Claude and his sources know their stuff.”


then writes this:

https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/22/15678186/michael-flynn-investigators-cummings


https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/16/15646762/trump-russia-classified-information-explainer
	Top White House officials, most notably National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, have called the story “false.” But if you parse their statements more carefully, you see that they’re not actually responding to the Post’s story.

	The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee says if it’s true that the president asked top intelligence officials to publicly deny that there had been any “collusion” between the Russians and the Trump campaign, it would suggest obstruction or politicization of the intelligence community.

	Rep. Adam Schiff of California commented on a report in The Washington Post that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers both refused Trump’s request.

	Schiff said Wednesday the committee wants any memos or other materials Coats and Rogers might have detailing conversations with Trump on the issue.

	Trump fired FBI Director James Comey earlier this month, prompting reports that Trump tried to get Comey to back away from investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn.


Schiff corroborating that Coats and Rogers were asked to publicly deny Trump-Russia collusion


Weren't Pompeo, Burr, and Nunes reportedly asked to do the same?


	Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page says he will testify next month before the House intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

	Page says details are still being worked out with the committee, but he expects to testify sometime during the week of June 6. He says he wants at least part of his testimony to be public.

	Page is one of several people associated with President Donald Trump’s campaign who are being investigated by congressional committees and the FBI over their ties to Russia. Page has denied any involvement in Russian attempts to influence the election.


All sorts of hearings coming up, no select committee or independent commission...


	The chairman of a House oversight committee says the FBI will not be turning over memos and other materials that detail discussions between former FBI Director James Comey and President Donald Trump.

	One of those memos reportedly details Trump pressuring Comey to shut down the bureau’s investigation into former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.

	Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, says in an interview on CNN that the FBI sent his committee’s staff a two-sentence email saying it would not be turning over the materials now that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel.

	The special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, is overseeing an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether there was any collusion with Trump associates.

Why? how does that make sense?

according to this random person:

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6d5nsk/the_latest_fbi_withholds_comey_memos_from_house/di02s3o/

	There's a chance that the congressional investigation could interfere with the FBI investigation, and reduce the chances of conviction. It's happened before.

	I've actually been expecting this.

How does that work? not sure how the documents being handed over to Congress could interfere with anything

	But in a secret memorandum sent last month to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Senate Intelligence Committee raised possible red flags about Kaspersky Lab and urged the intelligence community to address potential risks posed by the company’s powerful market position

What's going on here?

	 “I think we do ourselves a disservice by not speaking about this openly,” Michael Carpenter, who until January served as the Defense Department's deputy assistant secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, told ABC News.

	Products from Kaspersky Lab are widely used in homes and businesses throughout the U.S.

	But ABC News found that -- largely through outside vendors -- Kaspersky Lab software has also been procured by such federal agencies as the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and even some segments of the Defense Department.

	When Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, asked the panelists at the Senate hearing two weeks ago whether they’d be willing to use Kaspersky Lab software on their devices, Director of National Intelligence Coats said: “A resounding no from me.”

	All five of the other U.S. intelligence officials unanimously agreed.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/russia-trump-manafort-flynn.html
	The intelligence was among the clues — which also included information about direct communications between Mr. Trump’s advisers and Russian officials — that American officials received last year as they began investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates were assisting Moscow in the effort. Details of the conversations, some of which have not been previously reported, add to an increasing understanding of the alarm inside the American government last year about the Russian disruption campaign.

	The information collected last summer was considered credible enough for intelligence agencies to pass to the F.B.I., which during that period opened a counterintelligence investigation that is continuing. It is unclear, however, whether Russian officials actually tried to directly influence Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Both have denied any collusion with the Russian government on the campaign to disrupt the election.

	John O. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., testified Tuesday about a tense period last year when he came to believe that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was trying to steer the outcome of the election. He said he saw intelligence suggesting that Russia wanted to use Trump campaign officials, wittingly or not, to help in that effort. He spoke vaguely about contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, without giving names, saying they “raised questions in my mind about whether Russia was able to gain the cooperation of those individuals.”

I had figured it was mostly Bannon and Kushner? or his family?

Who does Trump listen to most, anyway?

He promoted Bannon to NSC and Kushner to the WH despite controversy, also kept on Flynn despite warnings. So he seems to like those three.

He fired Manafort though, so maybe Manafort isn't a major influence on him.

	Last week, CNN reported about intercepted phone calls during which Russian officials were bragging about ties to Mr. Flynn and discussing ways to wield influence over him.

Who would they be having phone calls about this, knowing they were being monitored? Did they want the U.S. to see these?

	Mr. Brennan said. Still, he said, even at the end of the Obama administration he had “unresolved questions in my mind as to whether or not the Russians had been successful in getting U.S. persons, involved in the campaign or not, to work on their behalf again either in a witting or unwitting fashion.”

Lying under oath? Then again Brennan doesn't seem to be the brightest bulb

	Mr. Flynn’s ties to Russian officials stretch back to his time at the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he led from 2012 to 2014. There, he began pressing for the United States to cultivate Russia as an ally in the fight against Islamist militants, and even spent a day in Moscow at the headquarters of the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service, in 2013.

	He continued to insist that Russia could be an ally even after Moscow’s seizure of Crimea the following year, and Obama administration officials have said that contributed to their decision to push him out of the D.I.A.

	Mazzetti said that his team had worked on the story for several months, and that neither the timing of the piece nor the motivation of their sources had anything to do with the news about the Trump intelligence leak. He said the story was reported and written before the other story broke.

	He indicated that the story had not even been “brought” to them, but that one reporter had just heard something from a source a few months ago, and that since then, the team on the story had been working on refining the story.

 	German intelligence officials have told their American counterparts that they don't need support in monitoring or safeguarding Germany's elections in the fall, a senior U.S. intelligence official told NBC News on Tuesday.

	The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified but has direct knowledge of the communications, said Germany doesn't want "any hint of U.S. involvement in any way."

	"They communicated, very clearly: 'We got this. We don't need your help,'" the official said. 

	The official said that Germany has its own robust counter-hacking and intelligence-gathering network and that there isn't much trust in the Trump administration — especially when it comes to elections. 

wow, that's a snub

Maybe they think U.S. is taken over by Russians now?

rubbing it in...

	“There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited,” Sun Tzu warned, so it follows that “To subdue the enemy without fighting is supreme excellence.” Hence, “The best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.”

	The U.S. has an anxious sense that the enemy is not only within the gates, but within the palace. Yet evidence is still lacking, so the country hesitates to oust its commander in chief. Moreover, the constitutional means of replacing a president can’t apply. Trump chose his vice-president and cabinet; all would have to be removed from office, as would key members of the Senate and House of Representatives. If the president himself is a Russian agent in place, and his party controls Congress, only a coup d’etat can create the conditions for rescuing American democracy.

	A coup, of course, would end the two-century legitimacy of American succession, and almost certainly lead to years of civil unrest if not outright civil war. From the Russian point of view, that would be just as good as keeping Trump in power. Either way, the U.S. and its allies would be unable to deter or punish their enemies.

	Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas.

	Among the high-profile figures who received waivers: White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, who were both permitted to engage with their former employers or clients. In addition, a blanket waiver was given to all executive office appointees to interact with news organizations -- a move that gives chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon permission to communicate with Breitbart News, the conservative website he used to run.


	The rate at which the Trump White House has handed out waivers is far faster than that of the Obama administration, which issued 17 exemptions for White House appointees over eight years.

	 GOP revels in Joe Biden buzz

	After months of enduring Trump and clown-car cracks, Republicans are enjoying watching Democrats squirm.

	By Katie Glueck 

Glueck same person who wrote the "Heritage Foundation behind Trump transition" article.

Seems to be implying here that Biden running will "play right into Repubicans hands"?


	“We’re constantly denounced as a circus, a clown show, a clown car,” said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, adding that competition has been good for the Republican field. But, she went on to add, “Pardon us if we’ve got the giggles over watching the Democrats, the so-called Democratic front-runner, hear [competitors’] footsteps and what was meant to be a runaway victory, what was meant to be a coronation, becomes their own … version of a clown car.”

	As chatter about a possible Biden bid has intensified over the past several days, plenty of Republicans are sounding more like Biden cheerleaders — even Biden consultants — than political foes, delighting in gaming out how Biden could emerge as a credible challenger to Clinton and knock out the sense of coronation that has lingered around her, even as she battles scandal-tinged headlines.

	“Oh, Run Joe Run,” said Conway, who is also president of a super PAC backing Ted Cruz.

Trump wants supreme court to do his unconcsitutional travel ban

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-idUSKBN18T09Z

	At least five votes are needed on the nine-justice court in order to grant a stay. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority, with Justice Anthony Kennedy - a conservative who sometimes sides with the court's four liberals - the frequent swing vote. Another of the court's conservatives, Neil Gorsuch, was appointed by Trump this year.

	If the government's emergency requests are granted, the ban would go into effect immediately.

	The court first has to act on whether to grant the emergency applications, which could happen within a fortnight. Then, the justices will decide whether to hear the government’s full appeal. The Supreme Court is not required to hear the case but is likely to due to its importance and the fact that the request is being made by the U.S. government.

	Now that the CIA has secretly concluded from secret evidence that there was a Russian plot to publicize secret emails, I fear that some sort of secret Russian mind-meld may have led me to write columns that were inexplicably critical of Hillary Clinton and wildly fair to Donald Trump.

	At the time, I thought I was simply reporting on Clinton’s decision to evade the Freedom of Information Act by hiding her official State Department correspondence on a private email server in her house. I thought I was interviewing Trump supporters at his rallies and reporting on why they were so happy he was running for president.

	But now, with the benefit of the CIA’s hindsight, I see that I was a Russian spy the whole time.

	I should have seen it earlier. There were so many clues.

	Robert M. Gates

	The record of U.S. intelligence in anticipating Soviet tactical and intermediate-range intentions, understanding them, and putting them in proper perspective is not particularly distinguished. We were unable (except, of course, for the then DCI) to predict the Soviet intention to put missiles into Cuba until we saw the photographs of them already there. We failed to anticipate the construction of the Berlin Wall, the ouster of Khrushchev, the timing of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and other events of importance.

	GLASNOST TRIED IN CHERRY HILL

	By DONALD JANSON

	 PHILADELPHIA— ALENE S. AMMOND, the Cherry Hill housewife who became known as ''The Terror of Trenton'' as a State Senator from 1973 through 1977, has been pursuing ''glasnost'' lately.

	Glasnost is the Russian word for the greater openness that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, says he is advancing in his country.

	Mrs. Ammond, an international business consultant and importer of French baby products, decided to try to find out if glasnost could be seized upon as a bridge to improve United States-Soviet relations or at least to a better understanding between American and Soviet people.

	She invited David A. Chikvaidze, an attache in the Soviet Embassy in Washington, to dinner to talk about glasnost and its potential with a representative grassroots assemblage of citizens from the Cherry Hill area.

	However, Mrs. Ammond said she was surprised to learn that Mr. Chikvaidze could not come to Cherry Hill because key Russians were barred from most of southern New Jersey. (Cary Cavanaugh, an official of the State Department's Office of Soviet Union Affairs, explained in an telephone interview that the United States arbitrarily selected and closed enough acreage in 1952 to match the percentage of Soviet territory closed to foreign travel. Areas closed to certain Russians, he said, are changed from time to time.) Undeterred, Mrs. Ammond arranged for dinner at a Philadelphia restaurant. After two cancellations by Mr. Chikvaidze, he and 30 residents of the Cherry Hill area met here for three hours on June 10.

	Mrs. Ammond called it ''citizen diplomacy'' and said:

	''It was an opportunity to explore new avenues of cooperation. Citizens can change things. We don't have to be passive observers.'' 



IF YOU SAY SO DONALD

	 ''I come away from this with salutory feelings,'' he said. ''Human beings are essentially the same all over the world. We are all coexistent in this earth of ours.

	''The most important thing we have to do is eliminate the threat of annihilation. I'd like to continue such dialogues as this.'' Said Mr. Chikvaidze: ''I've been enriched over the last three hours.''

	''This is not the last you've heard of me,'' said Mrs. Ammond. ''We're going to carry this forward.''

Bush may have been more interested in intelligence, but others in his administration were skeptical at best. Richard Perle, a longtime associate of Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld, said that “CIA’s analysis isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”

New York Prosecutor Joining Special Counsel Mueller’s Team

 	A top New York federal prosecutor is joining the team of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the former FBI director leading an investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election, a senior Justice Department official with knowledge of the matter confirmed to NBC News.

	Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Goldstein of the Southern District of New York will join Mueller’s team, the official said. 

 	...He's known for multiple successful prosecutions of New York lawmakers on corruption charges. He's also highly regarded in the Southern District and across Justice for those prosecutions, his thoroughness in investigations, and high level of success.

	Separately, a person with direct knowledge of the matter says that all cases previously handled in New York, which includes the probe of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, have been transferred to Mueller.

	Kremlin Expects US to Quickly Return Russian Embassy Assets

	MOSCOW — The Kremlin says its patience with a U.S. plan to return the Russian Embassy's compounds is running out.

	President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Monday that Russia has demonstrated a remarkable restraint by refraining from a tit-for-tat response to President Barack Obama's decision in December to expel 35 Russian diplomats and shutter Russian compounds in Maryland and on Long Island, New York.

	Ushakov says while Russia has shown "unusual flexibility," Moscow's patience "has its limits." He urged Washington to take action to "free Russia from the need to take retaliatory moves," emphasizing that Moscow will feel obliged to respond if the matter isn't settled.

	Putin and Trump are to have their first meeting at the sidelines of the G-20 summit, being held in Germany on Friday and Saturday.

	Justice Delayed For Those Tortured Under Communism 


	Half a century ago, Pavel Hubacka was blindfolded, his feet were shackled to the floor, and his hands were lashed to an overhead pulley for his sessions with the Czech secret police.

	“I had six serious interrogations, of which three were cruel beyond humanity,” said Hubacka, 74. “One of which lasted 70 hours. All the sessions ended with me being unconscious.”

	But Hubacka fared better than many. An estimated 20,000 people died under torture or in prison during Czechoslovakia’s communist regime. An additional 250 were executed, most during the vicious purges of the 1950s. After communism fell in 1989, Czechs vowed to punish the offenders.

	But today, no one is in prison. With thousands of other victims of official barbarity under Eastern European communism, Hubacka is vainly awaiting the prosecution of torturers that was promised in the days after the Berlin Wall fell 10 years ago, on Nov. 9, 1989. Since then, only Germany has pursued communist human-rights violators aggressively.

	Thick files documenting abuses gather dust on judges’ desks. Ten years after the world watched police beating protesters in Prague’s Wenceslas Square, many Czechs have concluded that the best way to face the future is by turning their backs on the past.

	The story is much the same across postcommunist Europe: early zeal to seek justice after 40 years of murder and repression has been dulled by time, indifference and practical realities: If you purge the communist bureaucrats, who will run the state? Is it fair to prosecute the border guard who killed an escapee without reaching for the commander who gave the guard his orders? 

	...“Throughout their lives, people here supported communism,” said Kolja Kubicek, a Prague attorney who defends some of the most famous ex-communists. “With a few exceptions like Havel, the sweeping majority of people were either active party members, supporters of the regime, or at least went with the flow.”

	“It’s a farce of justice we are witnessing,” said Pavel Bret, deputy director of the Czech Office for the Investigation and Documentation of the Crimes of Communism.

	“If these were Nazi criminals,” Bret said, “they would go to prison even if they were 130 years old. And there is a difference: Nazis were committing crimes against people from another state. Communists were torturing and killing their own people.”

	Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller has brought on Peter Strzok, a senior FBI official who oversaw the Hillary Clinton email investigation, to help manage his investigation into Russian election meddling, according to two US officials briefed on the matter.

	Strzok helped oversee the beginnings of the Russia probe last summer at the FBI.


Is this good or bad? e-mail investigation was a disaster


Comey's fault, McCabe, but what about Strzok?

Schuab says Trump administration ethics "laughingstock"


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/us/politics/walter-shaub-ethics.html
	WASHINGTON — Actions by President Trump and his administration have created a historic ethics crisis, the departing head of the Office of Government Ethics said. He called for major changes in federal law to expand the power and reach of the oversight office and combat the threat.

	Walter M. Shaub Jr., who is resigning as the federal government’s top ethics watchdog on Tuesday, said the Trump administration had flouted or directly challenged long-accepted norms in a way that threatened to undermine the United States’ ethical standards, which have been admired around the world.

	“It’s hard for the United States to pursue international anticorruption and ethics initiatives when we’re not even keeping our own side of the street clean. It affects our credibility,” Mr. Shaub said in a two-hour interview this past weekend — a weekend Mr. Trump let the world know he was spending at a family-owned golf club that was being paid to host the U.S. Women’s Open tournament. “I think we are pretty close to a laughingstock at this point.”


	...Mr. Shaub recommended giving the ethics office limited power to subpoena records, as well as authority to negotiate prohibitions on presidential conflicts of interest; mandating that presidential candidates release tax returns; and revising financial disclosure rules. But he acknowledged that some of these proposals would be difficult to pass in Congress.

	There are signs that lawmakers are open to considering the ideas. Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the new Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he was preparing to meet with Mr. Shaub. The effort could be a test of what kind of appetite Mr. Gowdy has to challenge the Trump administration as the chairman of what is traditionally the most active oversight committee in Congress.

	Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat, also wants to discuss the ethics office and ways to strengthen it.


	...His suggestion that Congress create new conflict of interest standards for the president, and require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns to the Federal Election Commission and have them posted by the Office of Government Ethics, may be more difficult to enact.

	Historically, presidential candidates and officeholders have voluntarily released their tax returns and divested their holdings. Mr. Trump has not. “Other presidents have understood it is a pragmatic necessity,” Mr. Shaub said. “This president seems to think it is a perk of high office.”


so Shuab is saying something off with Trump's tax returns

It followed a formal meeting between the two presidents that lasted more than two hours earlier in the day, and included their foreign ministers for a fraught discussion about Moscow’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 American elections.

	In the earlier meeting, Mr. Trump questioned the Russian president about his role in the American vote. Mr. Putin denied his involvement, and the two men agreed to move beyond the dispute in the interest of finding common ground on other matters, including a limited cease-fire in Syria.

	But the intimate dinner conversation, of which there is no official United States government record, because no American official other than the president was involved, is the latest to raise eyebrows. Foreign leaders who witnessed it later commented privately on the oddity of an American president flaunting such a close rapport with his Russian counterpart.


So Putin and Trump reportedly chummy at a private dinner, no other American official present

	“Pretty much everyone at the dinner thought this was really weird, that here is the president of the United States, who clearly wants to display that he has a better relationship personally with President Putin than any of us, or simply doesn’t care,” said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based research and consulting firm, who said he heard directly from attendees. “They were flummoxed, they were confused and they were startled.”


Ian Bremmer says he heard about it from other leaders, who were "flummoxed" by Trump chatting-up Putin

	...“We’re all going to be wondering what was said, and that’s where it’s unfortunate that there was no U.S. interpreter, because there is no independent American account of what happened,” Stephen Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine who also specializes Russia and nuclear arms control.


apparently there is no U.S. record of what said (and Trump doesn't count)


	...On Tuesday, the Kremlin intensified its demands for that the Trump administration return two compounds in the United States that the Obama administration seized from Russia last fall in retaliation for the election meddling. After meeting with Thomas A. Shannon, the under secretary of state for political affairs, Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, said he had warned the Americans that there must be an “unconditional return” of the property or Moscow would retaliate.


This article incinuating it has something to do with the compounds


	...Mr. Trump announced on Tuesday night that he planned to nominate Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former envoy to China and Singapore, as his ambassador to Russia. Mr. Huntsman’s nomination has been expected for months, but the multiple investigations into Mr. Trump’s campaign, and whether it colluded with Russia, are likely to figure prominently in his confirmation hearing.

	Russian Bots Are Starting to Attack the Republican Party
	By Chris Riotta On 8/7/17 at 12:55 PM 


why was this top of r/politics?

	Russian-linked bots and trolls have caused a surge in use of the hashtag #ResignPaulRyan on Twitter over the last 48 hours, just as the Republican speaker of the House was returning to his home state of Wisconsin for a month-long respite from Washington, D.C.

	The unusual boost in Russian bots targeting a Republican lawmaker was first observed by the German Marshall Fund’s Alliance for Securing Democracy, created after the 2016 presidential election to “defend against, deter, and raise the costs on Russian and other state actors’ efforts to undermine democracy and democratic institutions.”


Cover for Paul Ryan?


	It hasn’t been a common occurrence for the Alliance’s dashboard to pick up on Russian bot activity targeting members of the GOP since the site was launched last week by former FBI special agent Clint Watts.


Clint Watts being a Russian spy


why do this? try to manipulate public opinion on who is Russian spy and who isn't?


They also attacked McMaster, which is interesting. Make it so if you argue "see, Russian bots are attacking McMaster, so they must hate him!" they can attack a Russian spy the same way.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/climate/climate-change-drastic-warming-trump.html
	Government Report Finds Drastic Impact of Climate Change on U.S.

	The report finds it “extremely likely” that more than half of the global mean temperature increase since 1951 can be linked to human influence.


Is trump going to disagree with scientists? say they are politicized?


	Scientists say they fear the Trump administration could change or suppress the report. But those who challenge scientific data on human-caused climate change say they are equally worried that the draft report, as well as the larger National Climate Assessment, will be publicly released.



http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/345599-usda-office-told-to-use-weather-extremes-instead-of-climate-change
	According to emails obtained by The Guardian, officials told staffers in the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to change the way they discuss climate change in their work.

	According to the office, climate change would become “weather extremes.” Climate change adaptation should instead be “resilience to weather,” and efforts to “reduce greenhouse gases” should instead be deemed as ways to “build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency.”

	“We won’t change the modeling, just how we talk about it,” Bianca Moebius-Clune, the NRCS’s director of soil health, wrote in an email to staff on Feb. 16, according to the report. Moebius-Clune said the new language was given to her to pass on to staff.

	It is not clear whether the NRCS's use of "weather extremes" instead of climate change is part of a broader shift within the USDA. An official said the directive was designed to allow the office to continue its climate change work while presenting it in a way that would better resonate with the new administration and the agricultural interests with which it works. 

	...President Trump last month nominated Sam Clovis to be the USDA’s chief scientist. Clovis is not a scientist, does not have a science degree and has said he is “extremely skeptical" of climate change, claiming “a lot of the science is junk science.”

	EPA staffer leaves with a bang, blasting agency policies under Trump

	When Mike Cox quit, he did so with gusto.

	After 25 years, he retired last week from the Environmental Protection Agency with a tough message for the boss, Administrator Scott Pruitt.

	“I, along with many EPA staff, are becoming increasing alarmed about the direction of EPA under your leadership … ” Cox said in a letter to Pruitt. “The policies this Administration is advancing are contrary to what the majority of the American people, who pay our salaries, want EPA to accomplish, which are to ensure the air their children breath is safe; the land they live, play, and hunt on to be free of toxic chemicals; and the water they drink, the lakes they swim in, and the rivers they fish in to be clean.”

	Cox was a climate change adviser for EPA’s Region 10, covering Alaska, Washington, Oregon and Idaho. A former Peace Corps volunteer in Malawi, he’s been very involved in Bainbridge, Wash., coaching youth sports and serving on local boards and commissions. For two decades, the fit 60-year-old rode his bike eight miles to the ferry, then uphill to his Seattle office.

	He can get away with being so blunt because he sent the letter on his last day on the job. Yet his views reflect the disgust and frustration among the agency employees he left behind. Interviews with staffers point to a workforce demoralized by President Trump’s and Pruitt’s statements that conflict with science. They are worried about a new, backward direction for the agency and nervous about proposed, drastic budget cuts.


Try to get EPA employees to quit?


https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6s9qnn/government_report_finds_drastic_impact_of_climate/dlb82z8/
	You're close but I actually have a different theory. They aren't throwing people under the bus for a dime, it's far more sinister and quite in line with their other values. Remember, the GOP often belittles other groups for nothing more than the feeling of power. They don't just want to be rich, they want to see people as miserable so they can feel better about what they have. In the long run they want to have the power to decide who lives and who dies and climate change will give them that power. It's as despicable as it sounds but it fits right in with Republican contempt for the common man.

	A coalition of TV and media industry entities is urging the FCC to reject Sinclair Broadcast Group’s proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media, arguing that the combination would give Sinclair a dangerous level of power over the local TV marketplace.

	Today marks the deadline set by the FCC for the initial round of public comments in opposition to the merger agreement reached in May. The deal would give Sinclair control of more than 200 stations nationwide, expanding the Baltimore-based station owner’s presence to the nation’s largest TV markets for the first time.

	Executives from the American Cable Association, which represents smaller cable operators, Common Cause, the Competitive Carriers Association and the Computer and Communications Industry Association held a conference call Monday morning to outline their grave concerns about the Sinclair-Tribune deal.

	The executives are urging the FCC to reject the merger outright on the grounds that Sinclair would have what America One News Network president Charles Herring called “excessive, unbalanced market power” over many players in the media biz.

	U.S. health insurer Anthem will no longer offer Affordable Care Act plans in Nevada’s state exchange, the state’s insurance commissioner said Monday.

	The move comes after Republican senators failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, creating uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded in 2018.

	Nevada had said in June that residents in 14 counties out of 17 in the state would not have access to qualified health plans on the state exchanges. 


	...Anthem blamed the move in part on uncertainty over whether the Trump administration would maintain subsidies that keep costs down.

	Trump's legal team has been in contact with Mueller's office, and Dowd says he has passed along the president's messages expressing “appreciation and greetings’’ to the special counsel. 

	“The president has sent messages back and forth,’’ Dowd said, declining to elaborate further.

	Washington political circles for weeks have been on high alert for the possibility the president could try to get rid of Mueller or otherwise wrest control of the federal Russia probe he frequently denounces as a "hoax." 

	Yet the Trump legal camp cast the communications as a sign that the president is willing to cooperate with Mueller, whose office declined to comment, and former federal prosecutors say there are no rules that would prevent a president from passing along messages to the special counsel through an attorney. 

	Even so, Trump's private communications represent a "striking" contradiction with his public condemnations of the Russia investigation, said Jimmy Gurule, a former assistant attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration.

	"It's an extreme position to go from hateful statements to this," Gurule said. "What would cause him to change his mind?"

	OPINION | Mike Pence's 2020 run will go down in flames with Trump's presidency 

	By Cheri Jacobus


	Pence issued a statement of denial, or at least about 80 percent a denial (yes, Pence left some wiggle room, calling the suggestion he's running "laughable and absurd" rather than saying outright he is not running for president in 2020). But it's clear to even the casual observer or college freshman poli-sci major that Pence is readying for a run for the 2020 GOP nomination. 

	...While Pence sold his soul to be the right-hand guy to the worst president in history with approval ratings in the sewer, other potential GOP 2020 primary candidates such as Gov. John Kasich (Ohio), Sens Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) have the luxury of being unburdened by forced loyalty to an unprincipled demagogue they appropriately and rightly wrote off. 

	...Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also is well-positioned for 2020, and has carved out a niche of independence that distances her from Trump, thus placing her in that Kasich/Sasse category. 


Suggests Kasich, Cotton, Sasse, Haley instead


	Expect Trump's vice-president, hand-picked by Trump's former top aide, Paul Manafort, who is at the center of the Trump/Russia probe, to attempt to paint himself as a na ve waif on any and all Trump team Russia collusion.

	Pence clearly understands the trouble he's in after the New York Times piece. His press statement - the mere fact of it - served as a bit of a sad reminder of the heavy price everyone who attaches themselves to Trump eventually pays. The other potential candidates named didn't need such a press statement. 


reaching a bit?


	Pence will be the lonely boy peering through the fence watching the other children play and thrive, as Kasich and the others trek to Iowa and New Hampshire, freely offering public critiques of the disaster in the White House, while Trump's vice president (who fought for the job after Trump reportedly had already offered it to now-discarded Chris Christie) is tethered to Trump as his VP. That is, at least, until Trump gives him the Spicer/Preibus/Scaramucci/Christie/Romney treatment, with a large dose of humiliation to wash down the rejection.

	"He is purging anybody who does not want to have, basically, a war with Russia," Jones said of McMaster.

	Dugin agreed. "Globalists" like McMaster have made Russia "enemy No. 1," he said, because they need a battle to distract the public while they pursue their "satanic" plans and "destroy humanity."

	To a certain kind of corporate mind, a statement of organizational purpose — following a bottom-up, 360-degree, consultant-driven review process — is a big deal. The one currently under consideration at the State Department (according to an internal email obtained by my fellow Post columnist Josh Rogin): “We promote the security, prosperity and interests of the American people globally.” In contrast, the previous version called for “a peaceful, prosperous, just and democratic world.”

	This involves a crude reductionism. ExxonMobil may measure its success in interests and profits. But the United States is a nation dedicated to the principle that all are created equal. If our country does not stand for a “just and democratic” world, who will?

	In early remarks to State Department employees, the new secretary of state said that the promotion of American values “creates obstacles” in pursuit of American interests.

http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/08/mike-pence-nick-ayers-241423
	...Among the reasons Ayers didn’t join the White House in January was a long-running feud with former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who reportedly blocked his ascension to the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee in December and, according to one White House aide, worked to keep him out of the administration.

	Last week’s passing of the baton from Priebus to Kelly and from Pitcock to Ayers has heralded broader changes in the White House – reining in presidential aides and prompting more assertiveness from the vice president’s allies. 


Pence brought in more assertive aide?


	...It wasn’t just Pence who wanted Ayers back in the West Wing. Among those encouraging him to join the White House staff were Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and chief strategist Steve Bannon, as well as the president’s son, Don Jr., all of whom he worked closely with during the campaign, where he served as the chief conduit between Pence World and Trump Tower. “Nick previously served as a key asset contributing to the success of the campaign and is a great addition to the team,” Kushner told POLITICO in a statement. 


Or not? what's going on with that?


	Ayers is a schmoozer whose crisis-management skills the vice president has come to rely on. Given their close relationship, several administration officials said that his hiring was unsurprising. Nobody was more frustrated than Ayers, for example, at the sluggish response to reports that National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had deceived Pence about his meetings with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak – including the vice president himself, according to a person familiar with the situation – and Ayers has consistently pushed Pence to get off his hind legs and show some attitude.


sounds like a good guy?


	During the campaign, Ayers served at Bannon’s behest as the chief conduit between Pence World and the president’s core team, working with them on the vice-presidential vetting process, for example – and spent the last two weeks of the race traveling with the president. “He’s a Trump guy,” Bannon said.

Ronald A. Klain menacingly threatening Pence goes down with Trump


harping on report that Pence meeting with donors

	At the same time, however, it is likewise a mistake to assume any of this will do Pence any good if Trump’s presidency collapses. In the 213 years since the 12th Amendment created our system of joint presidential-vice-presidential tickets, no vice president has been elected to the highest office after serving with a president who declined to seek, or was defeated in seeking, a second elected term. And as for coming to office via the president’s ouster, the only vice president to follow that path, Gerald Ford, lost when he campaigned to retain the office — and he had far less to do with President Richard M. Nixon’s scandals than Pence does with the mess around Trump.

	Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Monday that all options for a new strategy in Afghanistan, including the use of private security contractors, remain under consideration by President Trump.

	Mattis said he believes a decision is "very, very close" after months of deliberation and that the administration is continuing to hone various options being presented to the president.

And the fact that that is controversial, makes me — I don’t know if I should laugh or — I have too much eye makeup on to start crying right now. It is disgusting," Timpf said.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/fentanyl-overdoses/
	In 24 of the nation’s largest cities and the counties that surround them, fentanyl-related overdose deaths increased nearly 600 percent from 2014 to 2016, according to county health departments nationwide. According to overdose records in those cities reviewed by The Washington Post, there were 582 fatal overdoses linked to fentanyl in 2014, a number that soared to 3,946 last year. Officials estimate there will be a much higher number of fatal fentanyl-related overdoses in 2017.


holy shit

	Cook County, Ill., (Chicago) recorded a 2,700 percent increase in fatal fentanyl-related overdoses, jumping from 20 in 2014 to 562 in 2016. Orange County, Fla., (Orlando) saw its 34 fatal fentanyl overdoses in 2014 triple to 105 in 2016. And Franklin County, Ohio, (Columbus) went from 13 such overdoses two years ago to 111 in 2016.


where did this come from, out of nowhere?


	...“If anything can be likened to a weapon of mass destruction in what it can do to a community, it’s fentanyl,” said Michael Ferguson, the special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s New England division. “It’s manufactured death.”

	...“This is a health crisis that’s worse than we’ve ever seen,” Farley said. “This will kill more people than the AIDS epidemic. You’d have to go back to the influenza pandemic of 1918 if you even wanted to start making comparisons.”


that the idea with Trump? disctract from this?

It’s required reading, especially for those who have convinced themselves that the presidential campaign is nothing more than a contest to see who can sustain the rudest diatribe against Donald Trump.  General Pacepa thinks it’s really about a mortal threat to America’s uniquely successful democratic capitalism, and he provides a detailed history of international Communism to prove his point.  He’s all for Trump:

    We are not personally acquainted with Donald Trump, but we firmly believe that the whole of America – Republicans and Democrats and fringe thinkers – should unite behind him in order to defend capitalism and our great country during these existentially dangerous times. The alternative is unthinkable.


??? Pacepa is for Trump? seems kindof weird?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Mihai_Pacepa
Pacepa is a columnist for the Internet conservative blog site PJ Media. He also occasionally writes articles for The Wall Street Journal and various American conservative publications, such as National Review Online, The Washington Times, the online newspaper FrontPage Magazine and the WorldNet Daily.

And he writes for PJ media?

something seems off about this... what's up with Pacepa?

So far seems like older information is accurate, newer is not? did the KGB turn him back? (maybe after Yeltsin?)


on Mihai Pacepa supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In opposition, large anti-war demonstrations were held in cities across the world. Pacepa contends that these protests were contrived and anti-American, which Russia assisted

hmmm




Financial PR firms and hired influencers help the Kremlin’s cause by arguing that “finance and politics should be kept separate.” But whereas the liberal idea of globalization sees money as politically neutral, with global commerce leading to peace and interdependence, the Kremlin uses the openness of global markets as an opportunity to employ money, commerce and energy as foreign policy weapons.

    The government’s application for the surveillance order targeting Page included a lengthy declaration that laid out investigators’ basis for believing that Page was an agent of the Russian government and knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow, officials said.

Here's one Trump advisor confirmed as a Russian spy.

They even got a FISA warrant for him. Anybody else want to whine and cry about "politically motivated  wiretapping" against the poor, innocent Trump camp?

On that note, you should call Nunes to testify in the hearings on Russia's activities.

Did the Okhrana back the Bolsheviks?

They used fear of Russian revolutionaries in France to "ally" Russian and France, while more and more revolutionaries kept showing up, then France helped create the soviet union.

So they could keep sending "revolutionaries" and be like "oh we can help you catch them... if you just share intelligence with us and let us set up camp..." so they could control both sides of the takeover that way.


https://www.henrymakow.com/001836.html

??? they behind the Spanish Flu too?

If they had the mindset of "cripple Europe as much as possible" then sure


But the whole Bolshevik revolution could have just been an intelligence coup. They might have figured communism would be a useful ideology to justify state control and give them more power. That could be why they wanted world war one--Europe disliked communism and would have supported the Czar, but with the war they were distracted fighting each other instead.

But America threw a wrench in their plans somewhat. So that could be why they see America as "the enemy", since America thwarted their plans to consolidate even more power.

Then they filled America with spies and tried again with WW2 to expand the Soviet Union, and when that became a stalemate they did peristroika to try again today.

The whole thing is just a crazy secretive cult bent on world domination. They just do divide and conquer with influence agents over and over again. Foment world chaos and grab power.

Saying 90% of Chinese like Putin? seems like another pro-Putin peice

	Putin revitalized the country, the style of toughness in line with China's nationalist sentiment

	Putin boycotted the West also coincides with the psychology of the Chinese people

	...So not only the media mislead the people, the people also based on their own needs to choose to select Putin

	As mentioned earlier, the Chinese media did not present a complete Putin. 

hmm that sounds familiar...

	After a series of turmoil, on March 18 this year, the Crimea region was incorporated into Russia. "Today we have to open the skylight to speak," Putin said in a speech at the national parliament, "Today we have to open the skylight and say" "Western partners have played, and we have our own position. "We are being deceived again and again, others are behind us to make decisions for us, leaving us are fait accompli." Putin vowed to end this history, his speech from time to time by the participants all cheered, applause Cheers and tears interrupted.

	March 20, the Russian public opinion research center released poll data show that Putin's support rate increased by 15.1% to 75.7%, a record five-year high. 63% of the respondents believe that Putin's most recognized work in the near future is dealing with the situation in Ukraine. In the eyes of many Russians, Putin is not only a wrist leader, but also a recovery of lost national hero.

	And even some European and American media also exclaimed "the Russian Empire back", there are many people pointed out that the European political are many leaders are "general" and "fans". In the face of Putin's stance, some people are skeptical about the effect of sanctions that are about to begin in Europe and America.

Russia attacking hospitals?

	Nigel Inkster, former director of operations and intelligence for MI6, told Sky News that one of the reasons the NHS in particular was vulnerable was its outdated software system. “A lot of hospital trusts in the U.K. — 40-plus last time I checked — are running their systems on Windows XP software, which hasn’t been supported by Microsoft for two or three years,” he said. “In other words, Microsoft is no longer looking for and seeking to repair vulnerabilities in the system.”

	Cybersecurity experts said the malicious software works by exploiting a flaw in Microsoft software that was described in NSA documents stolen from the agency and leaked publicly in April by a criminal group called Shadow Brokers.

	Malicious software that blocks access to computers is spreading swiftly across the world, snarling critical systems in hospitals, telecommunications and corporate offices with the help of a software vulnerability originally discovered by the National Security Agency.

	...The ransomware locks computers and then launches a ransom note in a text file, according to researchers at the Avast security software company in the Czech Republic. The note says that “you need to pay service fees for the decryption” and asks for $300 worth of bitcoin to be sent electronically to an address.


https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-06/russian-hackers-said-to-seek-hush-money-from-liberal-u-s-groups
	Russian hackers are targeting U.S. progressive groups in a new wave of attacks, scouring the organizations’ emails for embarrassing details and attempting to extract hush money, according to two people familiar with probes being conducted by the FBI and private security firms.

	At least a dozen groups have faced extortion attempts since the U.S. presidential election, said the people, who provided broad outlines of the campaign. The ransom demands are accompanied by samples of sensitive data in the hackers’ possession.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hospitals-across-england-report-it-failure-amid-suspected-major-cyber-attack/2017/05/12/84e3dc5e-3723-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html
	Officials made no public comment on the possible source of the hack, which touched off havoc and confusion across the state-run health system. Operations were canceled, emergency room services were scaled down, and medical personnel went back to using handwritten notes.

	Health officials offered no indication of when services might return to normal, or whether patient records could be permanently lost to the attack.

	“The most exploitable industry in the world is the health-care sector,” said Tom Kellerman, chief executive of Strategic Cyber Ventures. He said the industry is chronically hobbled by regulation and insufficient investment in computer security.

	A statement from NHS Digital — the computer services arm of the health service — said at least 16 hospitals or doctor’s offices were directly affected by the attack. Officials later acknowledged the number was rising, though they did not give a precise figure.

	Other health-care centers, meanwhile, turned off their computers to avoid potential infiltration. NHS Digital said it did “not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed.”

	...Attacks on health-care systems can also be especially high-stakes, creating potential life-or-death situations and raising the chances that the victim will ultimately pay. 

	Signs hung on the door at the emergency ward at the Royal London Hospital Friday afternoon read: “The emergency department has no IT facilities” 

	...The attack in Britain had immediate impacts in hospitals across the country. 

	Richard Harvey, 50, was just about to undergo surgery Friday afternoon on his leg following a motorcycle accident when a nurse told him that the procedure had been canceled due to a cyberattack. 

	...Doctors were using pen and paper as the National Health Service struggled to get computers back online. Routine appointments were being canceled.

	In early April of 1979, a mysterious plague wafted through the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk, now known as Ekaterinburg. At least 66 people and an unknown number of animals were struck with a vague illness and then swiftly died. Soviet officials blamed tainted meat sold on the black market. But a 1992 investigation by a Harvard researcher finally aired the real killer: a plume of anthrax spores accidentally released from a clandestine bioweapons plant in town, known as Compound 19.

	It was one of the largest inhalation anthrax outbreaks in history—and one of the few traces of the Soviet’s secret dabbling in bioweapons research—all thanks to botched air filter maintenance. The slow-moving death cloud that seeped from the compromised ventilation system left a trail of carnage 30 miles downwind of Compound 19. If the breeze had blown directly toward the center of town, which sits about 230 miles north of Russia’s border with Kazakhstan, thousands could have been killed.

You can wait for the next big "bombshell leak" to the press, but what's a leak to the press going to accomplish if all we do is wait? Congress knows there are people in the Government, presumably pro-American, who are behind these leaks. Pick a Congressional hearing (e.g. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/03/20/full-transcript-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-on-russian-interference-in-2016-election/ or https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/) and just about every other paragraph is a flustered Congressman interrogating an intelligence official about "unmasking" and "illegal leaks." Congress knows the leakers will likely leak more. And yet, they have still chosen to side against our country.

	YATES: We told him ... the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others, because in the media accounts, it was clear from the vice president and others that they were repeating what General Flynn had told them, and that this was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information.

	And that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.

	...we were there to tell the White House about something we were very concerned about and emphasized to them repeatedly. It was so they could take action.

https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/19/15561842/trump-russia-louise-mensch
	The Russiasphere doesn’t have one unifying, worked-out theory — like “9/11 was an inside job” or “Nazi gas chambers are a hoax.” Instead, it’s more like an attitude — a general sense that Russian influence in the United States is pervasive and undercovered by the mainstream media. Everything that happens in US politics is understood through this lens — especially actions taken by the Trump administration, which is seen as Kremlin-occupied territory.


This intentional? could spread conspiracy theories to discredit people who are suspicious of Russian influence in general


	One of them is Schindler, the former NSA spook. A former Naval War College professor who resigned in 2014 after a scandal in which he sent a photograph of his penis to a Twitter follower, he thinks Mensch doesn’t get it right all the time. But he does think she was onto the truth about Trump and Russia “long before the MSM cared” (the two have been amiably chatting on Twitter since 2013).


I had figured Schindler was meant for bigger and better things? he is former NSA. Guy is too crazy though, so maybe they realized that?

	Claude Taylor is the third core member of the Russia sphere. He’s a DC-area photographer who claims to have worked for three presidential administrations; his role is to provide inside information into the alleged legal cases against the president. He also routinely claims to have advance knowledge what’s happening, even down to the precise number of grand juries impaneled and indictments that are on the way. 

	...They’re also reliably boosted by a few allies with large followings — conservative NeverTrumper Rick Wilson, the anonymous Twitter account Counterchekist, and financial analyst Eric Garland (best known as the “time for some game theory” tweetstormer.)


	For instance, after the New York Times published the Mensch piece back in March, former DNC chair Donna Brazile tweeted out the story, with a follow-up thanking Mensch for “good journalism”:

	Thank you for good journalism. https://t.co/0qtqD4u1Nu
	— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) March 18, 2017 


Interesting... Brazile got duped? or working for them?


	Two former Obama staffers, Ned Price and Eric Schultz, favorably discussed a Palmer Report story aggregating Mensch’s allegations about Chaffetz (“interesting, if single-source,” Price tweeted). Larry Tribe, an eminent and famous constitutional law professor at Harvard, shared the same Palmer Report story on Twitter — and even defended his decision to do so in an email to BuzzFeed’s Joseph Bernstein.

	“Some people regard a number of its stories as unreliable,” Tribe wrote of Palmer. Yet he defended disseminating its work: “When I share any story on Twitter ... I do so because a particular story seems to be potentially interesting, not with the implication that I’ve independently checked its accuracy or that I vouch for everything it asserts.”

	And Keith Olbermann made a popular video for GQ based on Taylor’s allegations about imminent arrests, adding that “Claude and his sources know their stuff.”


then writes this:

https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/22/15678186/michael-flynn-investigators-cummings


https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/16/15646762/trump-russia-classified-information-explainer
	Top White House officials, most notably National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, have called the story “false.” But if you parse their statements more carefully, you see that they’re not actually responding to the Post’s story.

	The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee says if it’s true that the president asked top intelligence officials to publicly deny that there had been any “collusion” between the Russians and the Trump campaign, it would suggest obstruction or politicization of the intelligence community.

	Rep. Adam Schiff of California commented on a report in The Washington Post that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers both refused Trump’s request.

	Schiff said Wednesday the committee wants any memos or other materials Coats and Rogers might have detailing conversations with Trump on the issue.

	Trump fired FBI Director James Comey earlier this month, prompting reports that Trump tried to get Comey to back away from investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn.


Schiff corroborating that Coats and Rogers were asked to publicly deny Trump-Russia collusion


Weren't Pompeo, Burr, and Nunes reportedly asked to do the same?


	Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page says he will testify next month before the House intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

	Page says details are still being worked out with the committee, but he expects to testify sometime during the week of June 6. He says he wants at least part of his testimony to be public.

	Page is one of several people associated with President Donald Trump’s campaign who are being investigated by congressional committees and the FBI over their ties to Russia. Page has denied any involvement in Russian attempts to influence the election.


All sorts of hearings coming up, no select committee or independent commission...


	The chairman of a House oversight committee says the FBI will not be turning over memos and other materials that detail discussions between former FBI Director James Comey and President Donald Trump.

	One of those memos reportedly details Trump pressuring Comey to shut down the bureau’s investigation into former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.

	Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, says in an interview on CNN that the FBI sent his committee’s staff a two-sentence email saying it would not be turning over the materials now that the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel.

	The special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, is overseeing an investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and whether there was any collusion with Trump associates.

Why? how does that make sense?

according to this random person:

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6d5nsk/the_latest_fbi_withholds_comey_memos_from_house/di02s3o/

	There's a chance that the congressional investigation could interfere with the FBI investigation, and reduce the chances of conviction. It's happened before.

	I've actually been expecting this.

How does that work? not sure how the documents being handed over to Congress could interfere with anything

	But in a secret memorandum sent last month to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Senate Intelligence Committee raised possible red flags about Kaspersky Lab and urged the intelligence community to address potential risks posed by the company’s powerful market position

What's going on here?

	 “I think we do ourselves a disservice by not speaking about this openly,” Michael Carpenter, who until January served as the Defense Department's deputy assistant secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, told ABC News.

	Products from Kaspersky Lab are widely used in homes and businesses throughout the U.S.

	But ABC News found that -- largely through outside vendors -- Kaspersky Lab software has also been procured by such federal agencies as the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and even some segments of the Defense Department.

	When Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, asked the panelists at the Senate hearing two weeks ago whether they’d be willing to use Kaspersky Lab software on their devices, Director of National Intelligence Coats said: “A resounding no from me.”

	All five of the other U.S. intelligence officials unanimously agreed.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/russia-trump-manafort-flynn.html
	The intelligence was among the clues — which also included information about direct communications between Mr. Trump’s advisers and Russian officials — that American officials received last year as they began investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates were assisting Moscow in the effort. Details of the conversations, some of which have not been previously reported, add to an increasing understanding of the alarm inside the American government last year about the Russian disruption campaign.

	The information collected last summer was considered credible enough for intelligence agencies to pass to the F.B.I., which during that period opened a counterintelligence investigation that is continuing. It is unclear, however, whether Russian officials actually tried to directly influence Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Both have denied any collusion with the Russian government on the campaign to disrupt the election.

	John O. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., testified Tuesday about a tense period last year when he came to believe that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was trying to steer the outcome of the election. He said he saw intelligence suggesting that Russia wanted to use Trump campaign officials, wittingly or not, to help in that effort. He spoke vaguely about contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, without giving names, saying they “raised questions in my mind about whether Russia was able to gain the cooperation of those individuals.”

I had figured it was mostly Bannon and Kushner? or his family?

Who does Trump listen to most, anyway?

He promoted Bannon to NSC and Kushner to the WH despite controversy, also kept on Flynn despite warnings. So he seems to like those three.

He fired Manafort though, so maybe Manafort isn't a major influence on him.

	Last week, CNN reported about intercepted phone calls during which Russian officials were bragging about ties to Mr. Flynn and discussing ways to wield influence over him.

Who would they be having phone calls about this, knowing they were being monitored? Did they want the U.S. to see these?

	Mr. Brennan said. Still, he said, even at the end of the Obama administration he had “unresolved questions in my mind as to whether or not the Russians had been successful in getting U.S. persons, involved in the campaign or not, to work on their behalf again either in a witting or unwitting fashion.”

Lying under oath? Then again Brennan doesn't seem to be the brightest bulb

	Mr. Flynn’s ties to Russian officials stretch back to his time at the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he led from 2012 to 2014. There, he began pressing for the United States to cultivate Russia as an ally in the fight against Islamist militants, and even spent a day in Moscow at the headquarters of the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service, in 2013.

	He continued to insist that Russia could be an ally even after Moscow’s seizure of Crimea the following year, and Obama administration officials have said that contributed to their decision to push him out of the D.I.A.

	Mazzetti said that his team had worked on the story for several months, and that neither the timing of the piece nor the motivation of their sources had anything to do with the news about the Trump intelligence leak. He said the story was reported and written before the other story broke.

	He indicated that the story had not even been “brought” to them, but that one reporter had just heard something from a source a few months ago, and that since then, the team on the story had been working on refining the story.

 	German intelligence officials have told their American counterparts that they don't need support in monitoring or safeguarding Germany's elections in the fall, a senior U.S. intelligence official told NBC News on Tuesday.

	The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified but has direct knowledge of the communications, said Germany doesn't want "any hint of U.S. involvement in any way."

	"They communicated, very clearly: 'We got this. We don't need your help,'" the official said. 

	The official said that Germany has its own robust counter-hacking and intelligence-gathering network and that there isn't much trust in the Trump administration — especially when it comes to elections. 

wow, that's a snub

Maybe they think U.S. is taken over by Russians now?

rubbing it in...

	“There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited,” Sun Tzu warned, so it follows that “To subdue the enemy without fighting is supreme excellence.” Hence, “The best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.”

	The U.S. has an anxious sense that the enemy is not only within the gates, but within the palace. Yet evidence is still lacking, so the country hesitates to oust its commander in chief. Moreover, the constitutional means of replacing a president can’t apply. Trump chose his vice-president and cabinet; all would have to be removed from office, as would key members of the Senate and House of Representatives. If the president himself is a Russian agent in place, and his party controls Congress, only a coup d’etat can create the conditions for rescuing American democracy.

	A coup, of course, would end the two-century legitimacy of American succession, and almost certainly lead to years of civil unrest if not outright civil war. From the Russian point of view, that would be just as good as keeping Trump in power. Either way, the U.S. and its allies would be unable to deter or punish their enemies.

	Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas.

	Among the high-profile figures who received waivers: White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, who were both permitted to engage with their former employers or clients. In addition, a blanket waiver was given to all executive office appointees to interact with news organizations -- a move that gives chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon permission to communicate with Breitbart News, the conservative website he used to run.


	The rate at which the Trump White House has handed out waivers is far faster than that of the Obama administration, which issued 17 exemptions for White House appointees over eight years.

	 GOP revels in Joe Biden buzz

	After months of enduring Trump and clown-car cracks, Republicans are enjoying watching Democrats squirm.

	By Katie Glueck 

Glueck same person who wrote the "Heritage Foundation behind Trump transition" article.

Seems to be implying here that Biden running will "play right into Repubicans hands"?


	“We’re constantly denounced as a circus, a clown show, a clown car,” said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, adding that competition has been good for the Republican field. But, she went on to add, “Pardon us if we’ve got the giggles over watching the Democrats, the so-called Democratic front-runner, hear [competitors’] footsteps and what was meant to be a runaway victory, what was meant to be a coronation, becomes their own … version of a clown car.”

	As chatter about a possible Biden bid has intensified over the past several days, plenty of Republicans are sounding more like Biden cheerleaders — even Biden consultants — than political foes, delighting in gaming out how Biden could emerge as a credible challenger to Clinton and knock out the sense of coronation that has lingered around her, even as she battles scandal-tinged headlines.

	“Oh, Run Joe Run,” said Conway, who is also president of a super PAC backing Ted Cruz.

Trump wants supreme court to do his unconcsitutional travel ban

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-idUSKBN18T09Z

	At least five votes are needed on the nine-justice court in order to grant a stay. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority, with Justice Anthony Kennedy - a conservative who sometimes sides with the court's four liberals - the frequent swing vote. Another of the court's conservatives, Neil Gorsuch, was appointed by Trump this year.

	If the government's emergency requests are granted, the ban would go into effect immediately.

	The court first has to act on whether to grant the emergency applications, which could happen within a fortnight. Then, the justices will decide whether to hear the government’s full appeal. The Supreme Court is not required to hear the case but is likely to due to its importance and the fact that the request is being made by the U.S. government.

	Now that the CIA has secretly concluded from secret evidence that there was a Russian plot to publicize secret emails, I fear that some sort of secret Russian mind-meld may have led me to write columns that were inexplicably critical of Hillary Clinton and wildly fair to Donald Trump.

	At the time, I thought I was simply reporting on Clinton’s decision to evade the Freedom of Information Act by hiding her official State Department correspondence on a private email server in her house. I thought I was interviewing Trump supporters at his rallies and reporting on why they were so happy he was running for president.

	But now, with the benefit of the CIA’s hindsight, I see that I was a Russian spy the whole time.

	I should have seen it earlier. There were so many clues.

	Robert M. Gates

	The record of U.S. intelligence in anticipating Soviet tactical and intermediate-range intentions, understanding them, and putting them in proper perspective is not particularly distinguished. We were unable (except, of course, for the then DCI) to predict the Soviet intention to put missiles into Cuba until we saw the photographs of them already there. We failed to anticipate the construction of the Berlin Wall, the ouster of Khrushchev, the timing of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and other events of importance.

	GLASNOST TRIED IN CHERRY HILL

	By DONALD JANSON

	 PHILADELPHIA— ALENE S. AMMOND, the Cherry Hill housewife who became known as ''The Terror of Trenton'' as a State Senator from 1973 through 1977, has been pursuing ''glasnost'' lately.

	Glasnost is the Russian word for the greater openness that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, says he is advancing in his country.

	Mrs. Ammond, an international business consultant and importer of French baby products, decided to try to find out if glasnost could be seized upon as a bridge to improve United States-Soviet relations or at least to a better understanding between American and Soviet people.

	She invited David A. Chikvaidze, an attache in the Soviet Embassy in Washington, to dinner to talk about glasnost and its potential with a representative grassroots assemblage of citizens from the Cherry Hill area.

	However, Mrs. Ammond said she was surprised to learn that Mr. Chikvaidze could not come to Cherry Hill because key Russians were barred from most of southern New Jersey. (Cary Cavanaugh, an official of the State Department's Office of Soviet Union Affairs, explained in an telephone interview that the United States arbitrarily selected and closed enough acreage in 1952 to match the percentage of Soviet territory closed to foreign travel. Areas closed to certain Russians, he said, are changed from time to time.) Undeterred, Mrs. Ammond arranged for dinner at a Philadelphia restaurant. After two cancellations by Mr. Chikvaidze, he and 30 residents of the Cherry Hill area met here for three hours on June 10.

	Mrs. Ammond called it ''citizen diplomacy'' and said:

	''It was an opportunity to explore new avenues of cooperation. Citizens can change things. We don't have to be passive observers.'' 



IF YOU SAY SO DONALD

	 ''I come away from this with salutory feelings,'' he said. ''Human beings are essentially the same all over the world. We are all coexistent in this earth of ours.

	''The most important thing we have to do is eliminate the threat of annihilation. I'd like to continue such dialogues as this.'' Said Mr. Chikvaidze: ''I've been enriched over the last three hours.''

	''This is not the last you've heard of me,'' said Mrs. Ammond. ''We're going to carry this forward.''

Bush may have been more interested in intelligence, but others in his administration were skeptical at best. Richard Perle, a longtime associate of Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld, said that “CIA’s analysis isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”

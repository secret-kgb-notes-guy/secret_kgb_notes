they looked at multiple possible reasons for failure. "VM Ivanov" was in charge of evaluating correctness of manufacture and parts.

They were able to obtain and read telemetry from the craft and use this for their analysis.


If I read right, there were no discernable anomalies before the incident. After the incident, the craft was otherwise functioning, but they believe a restart occured sometime during flight.

after this, switched to "maintenance mode" or constant solar orientation mode

From Nov 9 to 24, the craft was able to stay powered

After the 24th, power was lost because the transmitter was not turned off after a communications session.



not sure if they assessed why it was correcting its orbit

pretty sure this isn't full report, just a summary

someone also put an english translation here (looks like google translate) with discussion


This guy says "most of the components were flight proven:"

someone did an analysis of it correcting it's orbit:

A big question is: was it supposed to do that?


	The manoeuvres almost certainly are attributable to the four 11D457F bipropellant 53.9 N thrusters that faced -X (aft)
in the vehicle's coordinate system. Their main purpose was attitude control, but also propellant settling (ullage burns)
prior to main engine firings. Consumption of fuel plus oxidizer was about 98 kg. Total burn duration was about 1289 s.


according to this was thruster burns

I think I saw somewhere else they observed a flash from thrusters too

Why were initial reports saying it could have been an accident? Like a gas leak or something?


says he is "95 percet confident" this was from "ullage burns"

should look up what that actually is

but think he is saying it was supposed to be firing thrusters (maybe to keep it pointing at sun?), not for the purposes of correcting orbit, but this is how things ended up anyway


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullage_motor


this says ullage is to clear gass out of fuel tanks and prepare the craft for a bigger burn

Is it supposed to be doing that if its in standby mode?

	On Tuesday morning the newspaper Kommersant, quoting sources from the space industry, reported that the malfunctioning Phobos-Grunt probe to Mars was the result of an error in its onboard computer caused by a software failure. This report was seen as an acknowledgement of a mistake in the computer program.

	But in the afternoon, speaking at a meeting on Russia’s space effort, Vladimir Popovkin, Roscosmos director, added some details to the explanation. “Two sets were rebooted and so computer reverted to energy-saving and command-waiting mode,” confirming the story carried by Kommersant. Then he added a new twist: “The most likely cause, according to the commission, was the effect of heavily charged particles on the facility.”

	Then he made another clarification. In his view, it was (probably) counterfeit microcircuits that were affected by the exposure. This reference was to imported components with a linear resolution in the lithographic process of 90 nm (instead of 200 nm as in previous equipment).

	The facts and data disclosed by Popovkin can be interpreted tentatively and specifically as follows: the Phobos computational facility failed because of the degradation of its electronic core under the impact of cosmic particles.


first one report says a software failure, then Roscosmos report concludes space rays (and media are skeptical), then Popovkin adds that he's concerned about counterfeit microcircuits. What's going on here?

One way the "space rays" explanation is hard to believe: if I read right, Roscosmos found the ship was functional before and after the incident that caused the reboot occured. If the problem was the sheilding, you'd expect either things to be fine (good sheilding) or the computer to be unworkable (bad sheilding or no sheilding). But it looks like Roscosmos' official explanation requires us to believe that the sheilding (or radiation hardening of the chips) was just bad enough for the incident to occur at this critical moment after launch and not any time before or the weeks afterward.


One helpful clue would be telemetry--if it includes a timestamp, that would tell you when the computer last rebooted. Apparently, the computer rebooted only once.

Why did Phobos Grunt fail?

the "official" explanation gives the media leeway to come up with many different theories. There is sort-of an assumption that Roscosmos is lying to cover something up, with most alleging incompetence or corruption on their part. This leaves the rest to speculate, and that in and of itself helps to bury the story.

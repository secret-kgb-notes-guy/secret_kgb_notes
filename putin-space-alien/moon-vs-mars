harder to colonize Moon than mars?

	A few days later, and a few miles down the perpetually congested NASA Parkway that skirts the southern flank of Johnson Space Center, I met another eminent scientist for lunch. An academic through and through, Paul Spudis lacks the adventurer-astronaut credentials of Grunsfeld, but he has a formidable scientific mind. And Spudis, inspired to specialize in lunar geology while watching the Apollo 15 astronauts explore the lunar surface, is also a formidable advocate for human exploration—of the Moon.

	Over a hamburger and dark beer at Boondoggles Pub, Spudis spoke about why he believes humans must return to the Moon before going deeper into the Solar System. As Spudis has outlined in a new book, The Value of the Moon, the Moon is nearby, scientifically interesting, and useful. Moreover, he argues, it is precisely because NASA has chased after ephemeral Mars dreams for the better part of the last half century that humans have remained confined to low-Earth orbit since the end of Apollo.

	Both men agree on one point: with NASA’s limited funds, even before possible cuts under a Trump administration, the space agency can’t do both. Sending astronauts to the Moon and establishing a colony would push human exploration of Mars into the second half of this century. Alternatively, making a direct push toward Mars would preclude any meaningful human exploration of the Moon.

	Think outside moon-Mars box: Maybe visit asteroid?
	By James Oberg

	The moon race of the 1960s was fueled by national anxiety about what the world would become if the Soviet Union grabbed a permanent lead in space exploration. So President Kennedy set a vision for the USA to reach the moon first.

	...Instead of sending astronauts back to the moon or off to Mars, the United States needs a space strategy that addresses today's national anxieties — without breaking the bank.


wtf is this?


not "national anxieties," it's survival. How would a supposed NASA guy not see that?

	A human presence on the Moon, says space expert James Oberg, would allow engineers to iron out the technical and medical challenges of a manned Mars mission, which require at least a year of space travel.

	SpaceX is rebooting its colonization plan, and may pivot to focus on a moon base that would aid that effort.

	We continue to learn that Mars is rich with resources that could be vital to supporting astronauts on the Red Planet for any extended period of time. Instead of launching resources such as water and materials to build a habitat to Mars, it could potentially be much more cost effective to send automated robots to harvest resources from the Martian surface and atmosphere in preparation for the arrival of humans.

	This colonization strategy is the subject of an April 2016 NASA scientific and technical information (STI) paper titled "Frontier In-Situ Resource Utilization for Enabling Sustained Human Presence on Mars," which argues that the information we have gleaned from rovers and orbiters suggests that there is an abundance of useful resources already on Mars. What's more, we are on the cusp of developing the technology that would be required to extract resources on Mars with robotic systems so they would be immediately available to arriving astronauts.

saying same thing--mars has resources for self-sustaining colony

	It's like going to Sahara in order to prepare for an expedition in Antarctica. The greatest benefit is the organizational experience of having done any kind of exploration mission. But much of the equipment and operations must be different. The Alaskan Husky and the skis are not so useful in Sahara. And the differences between the Moon and Mars are greater than differences between any regions on Earth.

	The space agency’s next major exploration program could last the better part of half a century, too. So we ought to choose wisely. The Moon is closer and offers potential utility as a refueling station in space. Mars harbors more intrigue in the search for life and represents the Solar System’s best bet for a second home. But we’re going nowhere without a final choice—followed by investment and commitment. Absent this from the Trump administration and Congress, NASA will continue to find itself adrift.

	“There is a lot of competition among countries in the space sector and so we must have a big super goal that could pull forward science and industry; that would enable the country to escape from the morass of problems, which have kept us captive for the past 20 years,” Rogozin told the Vesti FM radio station.

	“Why not try to build a big station on the Moon that would be a base for future ‘leaps’ of science?”.

	Russia’s renewed focus on the Moon may reflect a scaling back of ambition following a string of space failures and comes as other countries - notably China - are eyeing the Moon with greater ambition. Beijing plans to land its first probe there next year even though it still has a long way to go to catch up with space superpowers Russia and the United States. 

	...Last year, a Russian mission failed to return samples from the Martian moon Phobos, and last month the failure of a Proton rocket caused the multi million-dollar loss of Indonesia’s Telkom-3 and Russia’s Express-MD2 satellites.

	“We are losing our authority and billions of roubles,” Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told officials at a government meeting last month. 

	...“It’s too far and too expensive to Mars,” space industry expert Igor Lissov told the state RIA news agency. “We must start with the moon. We must give ourselves realistic goals.”

	In a press conference here April 4, Igor Komarov, director general of the Russian state space corporation Roscosmos, said he has talked with ESA about participating in any Moon Village effort.

	“We should go to the moon,” he said, in part to study issues associated with Mars missions. “It’s better to solve all these problems on the moon before going to Mars.”

	The chief concern was cost, since the entire mission could require over a trillion dollars. Much of the money will be spent to develop new technologies — like a system to protect astronauts from space radiation — that are needed to ensure deep-space travel is even possible. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and others said that the money might be better spent for other space projects, like cleaning up the space debris surrounding Earth, and creating a system to protect our planet in case of a potential asteroid impact. "There are a lot of things we could be doing in space," Rohrabacher said. "I hope that we make sure that we don’t waste dollars on things that we don’t accomplish anything with."

	...Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) talked about the 2014 National Research Council report, which was mandated by Congress and concluded that NASA's current strategy won't accomplish sending humans to Mars. Bridenstine questioned whether NASA's strategy improved at all. "We need to make sure that Congress is aware and understands what the objective here is and ultimately the direction we’re going to go," Bridenstine said, "because I don’t want to get another report in 10 years that says, under no circumstances will we ever get to Mars and between now and 10 years from now we will have made all these investments believing one thing and being told later something else."

	Mr. ROHRABACHER. Holy cow. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair-man. 

	I have been—I would just like to ask a fundamental question here because we have been talking about mission to Mars, okay, mission to Mars and different approaches to mission to Mars and what—I would like to ask the panel whether or not they think a mission to Mars is worth the cost or not. I mean if we do a mission to Mars—and correct me if I am wrong—we will have to defund most of the—I mean if we are going to do it now, start now and go directly into a mission to Mars, we are going to have to defund, you know, asteroid detection and then deflection. I mean we might as well forget that. I mean that is expensive. Debris cleanup which unless we don’t—unless we clean up the debris, of course, we may end up having our own use of near space being cut off from the fu-ture satellites because debris is knocking our satellites out of the air, no more GPS communication satellites, et cetera. Or how about space astronomy, which we know there is some very important projects moving forward with various telescopes that could give us a really in-depth view of the universe.

	You know, reading the—I mean unless we think that the tooth fairy is going to leave all the money under the pillow in order to accomplish a mission to Mars, is it really worthwhile, the vast ex-pense and the canceling of programs like this in order for us to take off and start heading on a Mars mission now? I will just go right down the line. That is fine.

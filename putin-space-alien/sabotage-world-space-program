	On July 6, Tad Szu1c putilished, an arti�le in  the Los Angles Times, in  which he claimed that the French government is  now investigating  the· possibility that the May 30 explosion of the European Space Agency Ariane rocket was caused by sabotage. While thi$ bombshell has been denied by official spokesmen of both the United States and France, Szu1c claims that France' s De�nse Minister, Andre Giraud touched on this topic when he visited Washington three weeks ago. He tied in the Ariane  expl.sion to the series of catastro­phes involving American spacq launches this year."

	In a departure from its public position, the French government has concluded that the explosion of its Ariane rocket at the Kourou launch site in French Guinea on May 30 may have been due to sabotage. According to French intelligence officials, the investigation into the Ariane accident has been secretly reopened because, "Initially we had no reason to raise the question of sabotage, but now we have reason to ask that question."

	France has shared its concerns and suspicions about Ariane with the highest levels of U.S. intelligence--French Defense Minister Andre Giraud is believed to have touched on this topic when he visited Washington last Tuesday and Wednesday--because of the series of catastrophes involving American space launches this year. The French and American accidents are adding up to a bizarre pattern, surrounded by strange coincidences and unexplained events, deeply preoccupying Western intelligence. These include the apparent defection to the Soviet Union in 1983 of the U.S. Air Force's leading expert on rocket self-destruct procedures.

	With the loss of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, a Titan 34-D rocket on April 18, a Delta rocket on May 3 and the French Ariane, all of which carried American reconnaissance satellites, the United States no longer has the capability of putting satellites into orbit to monitor Soviet nuclear deployments and serve as early-warning systems against a ballistic-missile attack. The Challenger and the Delta rocket were launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida, the Titan from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Before the string of 1986 losses, a Titan blew up at Vandenberg last August and an Ariane rocket exploded at Kourou in September.

	...French intelligence officials say that while the report is technically correct (the 1985 Ariane accident had the same cause), "it is very easy to perform sabotage in this context by one very well-placed person."

	...Intelligence officers believe that Hughes was either captured by Soviet agents or voluntarily defected to the Soviet Union. At the time of his disappearance, the Air Force said that he had no classified materials with him. But these intelligence officers point out that Hughes' knowledge of all the top-secret rocket launch procedures was invaluable to the Soviets, perhaps more so than the secrets delivered by recently captured spies. "He is worth his weight in gold to the Russians in terms of future 'Star Wars,' if we have them," one said. They see a clear link between Hughes and possible sabotage of the American and French launches.

	Another bizarre occurrence, neither explainable nor evidence of anything, was the sudden disappearance of Soviet trawlers from the Cape Canaveral area four hours before the scheduled launch of the Challenger on Jan. 28. The trawlers, which are electronic spy vessels, had been on station off the cape from the start of the U.S. space program. On that January morning, however, three or four trawlers steamed at flank speed in a northeastern direction away from the coast. Normally, these trawlers seek to monitor telemetric signals from the rockets before, during and after launch because they provide crucial data on the space vehicles' performance--among the most avidly sought information by both the United States and the Soviet Union on each other's ballistic arsenals. It is an absolute mystery why the trawlers, as observed by the U.S. Navy, went off station in this manner.

	The spectacular Christmas-day explosion of India's new Geo-Synchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV) — a gleaming 167-ft. (51m) tower of rocket — spared the country the deaths that sometimes accompany space disasters, but the public humiliation was another matter. Crowds swarmed the Satish Sahwan Space Center in Andhra Pradesh in anticipation of the launch and millions more watched live on TV as the GSLV's engines were lit at 4:04 PM. Forty-seven seconds later, engineers on the ground lost control of the vehicle. Sixteen seconds after that, they blew the haywire rocket up. A booster that was supposed to carry a critical telecommunications satellite into high-Earth orbit instead met its end just eight miles (13 km) over the Bay of Bengal.

	...If there was any upside to the findings, it was in the type of cells Wadsworth and Cockell used in their study. Bacillus subtilis are among the commonest Earthly bacteria that can contaminate spacecraft before they leave the ground. The fear has always been that if they survived the interplanetary trip, the cells could contaminate Mars too, perhaps outcompeting native organisms. The fact that Mars is so unfriendly to at least this one type of life is very good news. The fact that it could be similarly hostile to all life is decidedly less so.

	China’s moon programme takes a hit due to Long March rocket failure

	Causes are still being investigated, but the second Long March mishap in two weeks was probably due more to bad luck than incompetence

	The unsuccessful rocket launch on Sunday could affect future Chinese space programmes, according to experts.

	Important projects including lunar exploration and space construction could be delayed, they said.

	It was China’s second launch mishap in less than two weeks. On June 19, a CZ-3 rocket launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in Sichuan province failed to deliver a television broadcasting satellite into orbit.

	China’s Long March rockets have been known for their reliability. Failures were rare, and two so close together is almost unprecedented.

	...In the past two years, three major waves of redundancies have been inflicted at factories owned by the country's only remaining major satellite manufacturer, Matra Marconi Space - which is half-owned by French aerospace interests. Hundreds of expert satellite builders have been paid off and the manufacturing plant at Filton, near Bristol - where satellites such as Giotto, which was sent to Halley's Comet in 1986, were made - has been closed.

	 The leak of the SLS numbers brought out the program's critics as well.

	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who has advocated redirecting funds from SLS to NASA's effort to nurture commercially developed systems for ferrying crews to and from the international space station, said the cost estimates are grounds for terminating the heavy-lifter program.

 	"If true, these estimates are ridiculous," Rohrabacher said in response to a Space News query. "There is no way that the American people want us to spend more than $60 billion for a space exploration program that includes only one manned spaceflight before the end of the decade. Congress just canceled Constellation last year for these very same reasons."

	NASA finds apparent sabotage

 	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) -- The U.S. space agency NASA on Thursday confirmed it had discovered the apparent sabotage of a noncritical component of the international space station due to be carried up by the space shuttle Endeavour. It launched an investigation after finding cut wires in a piece of computer equipment intended to transfer data from station sensors to the ground, the agency said.

	NASA Finds Evidence of Sabotaged Computer Bound for Space Station

	Two weeks before the US space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to lift-off, the US space agency NASA says a piece of equipment that was to fly on the mission was deliberately sabotaged.

	During a briefing on launch preparations for space shuttle Endeavour, NASA officials revealed that a space program worker deliberately damaged a piece of equipment that is scheduled to fly aboard the space craft.

	The tampered device was due to be delivered to the International Space Station by Endeavour. It measures strain on a space station beam and relays the information to controllers on the ground.

	NASA's chief of space operations, Bill Gersteinmaier, says the space agency was notified of the sabotage by the company servicing the mission.

	"We then inspected the flight unit and determined that some wires were cut on the inside of that unit. It's a subcontractor on the space station side," he said. "We'll fix the hardware. We'll get [it] ready to go fly. I can't really discuss that and won't discuss that much more at this point."

	Gerstenmaier says the sabotage is under investigation and officials declined to speculate on a motive.

	Prof David Southwood, a space scientist at Imperial College London, noted that Mars missions seem particularly prone to mishap. “If one were superstitious, one would say it is a return of the Mars gremlin.” However, he added that the failed landing attempt should not detract from the more important element of the mission, which was always intended to be orbiter’s measurements of trace gases, such as methane, which might indicate the presence of alien life.

	“Time and again the US Mars program faced failure and, like Robert the Bruce, straightforwardly went on with the task of overcoming setback,” he said. “Space exploration is tough. As long as we believe in its societal worth, Europe needs to do the same.”

In 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter became the Mars Collider and a case study for students of planetary exploration. The spacecraft was meant to be the first to observe the weather on another planet, but instead slammed into the atmosphere and tore apart. An investigation panel found the glitch in the spacecraft’s software. The force delivered by onboard thrusters was coded in imperial pounds instead of metric Newtons.

	According to Express, well known alien conspiracy theorist Scott C Waring offered his two cents about the news. He believes NASA is behind Schiaparelli’s crash and also had a hand in popping several foreign probes in the past.

	He accused the Americans of destroying the Russian Phobos probe in 1989 and the Phobos-Grunt lander in 2011. Waring says this was done to prevent other space agencies from finding evidence of life on Mars. While the theory seems very far-fetched, the Wikileaks email dump contained conversations between Clinton campaign chief John Podesta acknowledges the existence of aliens.

	“I was going to write a post about five days ago when I heard about the ESA Mars lander getting close to Mars…but then I just shrugged it off” Waring wrote on his blog UFO Sightings Daily. He says that the Americans have done it again except that this time they sabotaged their European neighbors.

	Monday, January 21, 2008


	...However, once a logical reconstruction gels, is tested, and then is ultimately verified by being implemented and hence reducing future flight hazards, that official explanation achieves a substantial level of authenticity. But not to everyone’s satisfaction, apparently, as a search of still-thriving non-traditional explanations of the Apollo 1 fire, the Apollo 13 breakdown, the Challenger disintegration, and the Columbia catastrophe, whose fifth anniversary now approaches.

	For example, in the case of Columbia, YouTube is full of videos from self-styled experts still convinced a freak bolt of ionospheric lightning crippled the spaceship. A famous photograph supposedly shows that bolt, even though space experts have long been satisfied that the bizarre image was merely the result of camera jiggle during a time-lapse exposure.


https://medium.com/hci-design-at-uw/information-wars-a-window-into-the-alternative-media-ecosystem-a1347f32fd8f
	Over time, we noted that a similar kind of rumor kept showing up, over and over again, after each of the man-made crisis events — a conspiracy theory or “alternative narrative” of the event that claimed it either didn’t happen or that it was perpetrated by someone other than the current suspects.


http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1043/1
	Apart from the comic relief value of such crackpot ideas, there’s a darker aspect of this kind of cultural pathology, just as there are serious analyses pointing to the socially toxic effects of the JFK assassination “alternate theories”. For spaceflight, being distracted by the wrong cause means being tempted by the wrong fix. That’s never amusing, and often can be expensive.


similar to his comments on Popovkin's claims of sabotage

	Dark Mission portrays the failure of the Mars Observer probe in 1993 as a deliberate act by NASA to prevent the publication of its expected photographs of artificial Martian ruins. But the description of the events is inconsistent with well-documented accounts, reports non-existent events, and omits well-known explanations for important features of the probe’s flight plan. All of this can be easily confirmed through Internet searches.


sounds like book authors and Oberg are both liars? but I guess the book was somehwat popular, which is Oberg's stated reason for calling attention to it


	...In a simple reading comprehension verification test, this one incident indicates a severe problem with the book’s authors’ ability to understand, and restate, simple English about space technology. In one sentence, there were three swings, and three misses—three strikes.


Is he being condescending on purpose? doing the same thing he always does--deny rumors in a way that makes people think they're true


	...By the way, after NASA’s official denunciations of the UPI story I had written (I have the honor of being the only journalist ever denounced by name in an official NASA press release), the story turned out even worse than I had written. Space engineers hadn’t fudged the test results, after all. My source was wrong about this, this time, the first occasion in a long sequence of accurate leaks. What was far worse was that NASA had decided that any such tests weren’t even necessary. The engine ignition system was never tested at temperatures expected out at Mars, because (JPL said) the engine had already flown in space on some other mission and so didn’t need to be requalified. But NASA press officials, despite repeated inquiries from me and promises of cooperation from them, never disclosed the space mission(s) that these special engines had been originally flown on.


NASA denounced Oberg, who blames his "sources"


something going on here?


	The same design engines are installed aboard the Mars Phoenix lander now on route. Hopefully, improvements have been made.

Here's what the "Dark Mission" book cites on Oberg's UPI article:

	March 22, 2000

	James Oberg of UPI claims that NASA knew there was a problem  with the Mars Polar Lander propulsion system prior to the Dec. 3 landing attempt and "withheld this conclusion from the public." NASA categorically denies this charge.


	...*   Had UPI researched the public documents released on Nov. 10, 
which have been available online at the NASA Home Page, the 
reporter would have been able to conclude that NASA did indeed 
publicly address propulsion issues, and specifically, the 
propulsion system's "catalyst bed" temperature concern.

	*   Based on this review, NASA knew about the concerns with the 
propulsion system, NASA took corrective action, and NASA hid 
nothing from the public.  We made our concerns known in early 
November.


	...Both the Stephenson and Casani (John Casani, retired JPL 
flight programs head and also director of mission assurance) teams 
have conducted intensive reviews relating to Mars Polar Lander, 
and their teams have surfaced no evidence relating to thruster 
acceptance testing irregularities as alleged by UPI.  In fact, 
members of the review teams are using words like "bunk," "complete 
nonsense," and "wacko," to describe their reactions to UPI's 
charge.

	HOUSTON, March 21 (UPI) -- The disappearance of NASA's Mars Polar Lander last December was no surprise to space officials, UPI has learned. 

	Prior to its arrival at Mars, a review board had already identified a fatal design flaw with the braking thrusters that doomed the mission, but NASA withheld this conclusion from the public.

	...A source close to the panel probing the second accident has told UPI that its conclusions are "devastating" to NASA's reputation. Unlike the previous accident, where management errors merely prevented the recognition of other human errors, in this case it was a management misjudgment which caused the fatal flaw in the first place.

	Why The Mars Probe Went Off Course

	SPECTRUM Magazine

	December 1999


	...Then, on 23 September, through a series of still-baffling errors, flight controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a California Institute of Technology facility under contract to NASA, sent erroneous steering commands to the Mars Climate Orbiter as it neared the target planet. Obeying blindly like all true robots, the probe, metaphorically speaking, marched off the cliff and was destroyed.


a different story from pounds and newtons mixup?

	...NASA assigned three separate teams to investigate the embarrassing, US $125 million debacle and determine its cause. Preliminary public statements faulted a slip-up between the probe's builders and its operators, a failure to convert th e English units of measurement used in construction into the metric units used fo r operation.


ok no its the same thing


http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/01/news/mn-17288
	NASA lost its $125-million Mars Climate Orbiter because spacecraft engineers failed to convert from English to metric measurements when exchanging vital data before the craft was launched, space agency officials said Thursday.

	A navigation team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory used the metric system of millimeters and meters in its calculations, while Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, which designed and built the spacecraft, provided crucial acceleration data in the English system of inches, feet and pounds.

	As a result, JPL engineers mistook acceleration readings measured in English units of pound-seconds for a metric measure of force called newton-seconds.

	In a sense, the spacecraft was lost in translation.

	"That is so dumb," said John Logsdon, director of George Washington University's space policy institute. "There seems to have emerged over the past couple of years a systematic problem in the space community of insufficient attention to detail."


so Lockheed for whatever reason gave them data in wrong units, never specified

gave commands to the probe using those units, then the probe crashed

	By William Harwood CBS News October 20, 2016, 7:58 AM
	Did Europe's Mars lander crash and burn on the Red Planet?

	The European Space Agency’s Schiaparelli Mars lander plunged into the planet’s atmosphere Wednesday, survived the hellish heat of entry and successfully deployed a huge parachute to slow down before falling free and firing up its braking rockets to land on the martian surface, engineers said Thursday. 

	But then suddenly, its signal vanished.

	Fifty seconds before the expected touchdown, the experimental lander abruptly stopped transmitting telemetry. At that point, it was expected to be less than a mile above the surface and descending at about 150 mph.

	...Throughout the six-minute descent, the lander transmitted a steady stream of telemetry to the TGO mothership, which recorded the data and relayed it back to Earth overnight Wednesday.

	...But the telemetry suddenly stopped right around the moment the parachute was released. The recorded data show at least some of the thrusters fired for a few seconds at least, but engineers have not yet had time to tease out altitude, velocity and other details that might shed light on what happened in the 50 or so seconds between the loss of signal and the lander’s impact on the surface.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Polar_Lander
	On December 3, 1999, Mars Polar Lander encountered Mars while mission operators began preparing for landing operations. At 14:39:00 UTC, the cruise stage was jettisoned, beginning a planned communication dropout until the spacecraft had touched down on the surface. Six minutes prior to atmospheric entry, a programmed 80-second thruster firing turned the spacecraft to the proper entry orientation, with the heat shield oriented to absorb the 1,650 °C heat that would be generated as the descent capsule passed through the atmosphere.

	Traveling at 6.9 kilometers per second, the entry capsule entered the Martian atmosphere at 20:10:00 UTC and was expected to land in the vicinity of 76°S 195°W in a region known as Planum Australe. Communication was expected to be reestablished with the spacecraft at 20:39:00 UTC after having landed. However, no communication was possible with the spacecraft and the lander was declared lost.[2][4][5]

	On May 25, 2008 the Phoenix lander arrived at Mars, and has subsequently completed most of the objectives of the Mars Polar Lander, carrying several of the same or derivative instruments.

	By Mark Strauss 

	April 14, 2011

	...“The decision to proceed with Apollo was not made because it was enormously popular with the public, despite general acquiescence, but for hard-edged political reasons,” writes Roger D. Launius, the senior curator at Smithsonian’s divison of space history, in the journal Space Policy. “Most of these were related to the Cold War crises of the early 1960s, in which spaceﬂight served as a surrogate for face-to-face military confrontation.” However, that acute sense of crisis was fleeting—and with it, enthusiasm for the Apollo program.


an interesting way to frame it


	4. “During the 1990s, NASA deliberately destroyed its own Mars space probes.”

	Mars is the planetary equivalent of Charlie Brown’s kite-eating tree. During the 1990s, NASA lost three spacecraft destined for the Red Planet: the Mars Observer (which, in 1993, terminated communication just three days before entering orbit); the Mars Polar Lander (which, in 1999, is believed to have crashed during its descent to the Martian surface); and the Mars Climate Orbiter (which, in 1999, burned up in Mars’ upper atmosphere).

	Conspiracy theorists claimed that either aliens had destroyed the spacecraft or that NASA had destroyed its own probes to cover-up evidence of an extraterrestrial civilization.

	The most detailed accusation of sabotage appeared in a controversial 2007 book, Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA, which declared “no cause for the [Mars Observer’s] loss was ever satisfactorily determined.”

	Dark Horizon “came within one tick mark of making it onto the New York Times bestsellers list for paperback non-fiction,” bemoaned veteran space author and tireless debunker James Oberg in the online journal The Space Review. In that same article, he points out the book’s numerous errors, including the idea that there was never a satisfactory explanation for the probe’s demise. An independent investigation conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory concluded that gases from a fuel rupture caused the Mars Observer to enter a high spin rate, “causing the spacecraft to enter into the ‘contingency mode,’ which interrupted the stored command sequence and thus, did not turn the transmitter on.”

	NASA did have a noteworthy success in the 1990s, with the 1997 landing of the 23-pound Mars rover, the Pathfinder. That is, of course, if you believe it landed on Mars. Some say that the rover’s images were broadcast from Albuquerque.

	...Had JFK not been assassinated in 1963, it is possible that the space race to the Moon would instead have been a joint venture with the Soviet Union.

	Initially, the young president saw winning the space race as a way to enhance America’s prestige and, more broadly, to demonstrate to the world what democratic societies could accomplish.

	However, JFK began to think differently as relations with the Soviet Union gradually thawed in the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis and the costs of the Moon program became increasingly exorbitant. Nor was America confident at that time that it could beat the Soviet Union. And, in his recent book, John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon, space historian John Logsdon notes that the president also believed that the offer of a cooperative mission could be used as a bargaining chip in Washington’s diplomatic dealings with Moscow.

	In a September 1963 speech before the United Nations, JFK publicly raised the possibility of a joint expedition: “Space offers no problems of sovereignty…why, therefore, should man’s first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition? Why should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research, construction and expenditure?”

	But, the prospect of a U.S.-Soviet mission to the Moon died with Kennedy. Winning the space race continued to drive the Apollo program. Eventually, “the U.S. space program, and particularly the lunar landing effort,” Logsdon writes, became “a memorial” to JFK, who had pledged to send a man to the Moon and return him safely by the end of the decade.

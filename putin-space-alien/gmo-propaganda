	The agrichemical industry faces major public relations challenges, so it needs superb PR assistance. Perhaps it is not surprising that they hired the public relations firm that represents Russia, Ketchum, to manufacture the spin they need to keep its lavish profits flowing from the sale of genetically engineered seeds and related pesticides.

	Americans believe that there's no scientific consensus on GMOs. Just over 50 percent of respondents believe that "about half or fewer" of scientists agree that GM foods are safe to eat. Only 14 percent's beliefs match the reality — that "almost all" scientists agree that GM foods are safe to eat.

	And finally, there is deep cynicism about the motives of scientists. According to the survey, Americans feel that research findings are influenced in equal measure by the following factors: the best available scientific evidence; desire to help their industries; and desire to advance their careers. In the view of the public, all of those factors are more important to scientists than concern for the public interest.

	Seeding doubt
	How self-appointed guardians of 'sound science' tip the scales toward industry

	By Liza Gross, November 15, 2016

	At a time when public mistrust of science runs high, and non-experts are hard-pressed to separate fact from industry-sponsored spin, Sense About Science, a charity based in London with an affiliate in New York, presents itself as a trustworthy arbiter.

	She’s handled international politics (Russian spacecraft are currently the only way for astronauts to get to the International Space Station),

except now they're not you morons


	business (NASA has moved toward public-private partnerships with companies like Orbital ATK and SpaceX to deliver cargo and eventually crew to the station following the retirement of the space shuttle), and numerous setbacks (from launch explosions to budget cuts to a declining interest in space)

	Amid growing tensions between the UK and Russia, the Alexander Litvinenko case has been hitting the headlines. On Wednesday 28th January national newspapers, including the Telegraph, Mirror, and Independent led with the story that a ‘radioactive trail’ left by the assassins over London meant that “many thousands of members of the public, both British residents and visitors from overseas, might have been at risk from the radioactivity” Robin Tam, QC.

	But with quotes like “could have massacred thousands of people” how real was the risk to the general public? How much danger were the capital’s residents and visitors actually in?

	...Dr Roberts' take home message was that “there was a risk, but it was limited by the fact that the 210Po had to enter the body.” So in reality the risk to the public was lower than these stories suggested.

	By the way, the Russians did make good political jokes.
My favourite was made by 
Gorbachov when he met Ronald Reagan.
They got on very well, as Gorbachov did with all 
Western leaders, but at some point Reagan said to him:  
“
You know, there is on
e 
fundamental difference between America and the Soviet Union. Anyone can come into my 
office and say: ‘I don’t like the way Reagan is running the government of America’”.
“Nonsense,” said Gorbachov, “There
is no such difference.
Anyone can come into 
my
of
fice 
in the Kremlin and say: 
‘
I don’t like the way Reagan is running the government of America’”.
I can’t resist one other cold war joke, this time by Kissinger. When asked what would have 
happened if Khruschev had been shot instead of
Kennedy.
He said: ”I
don’t think Onassis 
would have married Mrs Khruschev.”


they do make good political jokes

	Anti-genetic-modification campaigners and academics have criticised Sense About Science for what they view as a failure to disclose industry connections of some advisers,[62] and Private Eye reported that it had seen a draft of the Making Sense of GM guide that included Monsanto Company's former director of scientific affairs as an author.[63] Tracey Brown, managing director of Sense About Science, rebutted these claims on the SAS website.[64]


same deal as GLP? not nearly as over-the-top

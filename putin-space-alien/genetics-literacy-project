	Like all 501(c)(3) organizations, the Templeton Foundation is prohibited from engaging directly in political activity. However, a number of journalists have highlighted connections with conservative causes. A 1997 article in Slate Magazine said the Templeton Foundation had given a significant amount of financial support to groups, causes and individuals considered conservative, including gifts to Gertrude Himmelfarb, Milton Friedman, Walter E. Williams, Julian Lincoln Simon and Mary Lefkowitz, and referred to John Templeton, Jr., as a "conservative sugar daddy".[76] The Foundation also has a history of supporting the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, as well as projects at major research centers and universities that explore themes related to free market economics, such as Hernando de Soto's Instituto Libertad Y Democracia and the X Prize Foundation.

	In a 2007 article in The Nation, Barbara Ehrenreich drew attention to the Foundation's president John M. Templeton Jr. funding of the conservative group Freedom's Watch, and referred to the Foundation as a "right wing venture".[77] Pamela Thompson of the Templeton Foundation, responding to Ehrenreich's allegations, asserted that "the Foundation is, and always has been, run in accordance with the wishes of Sir John Templeton Sr, who laid very strict criteria for its mission and approach", that it is "a non-political entity with no religious bias" and it "is totally independent of any other organisation and therefore neither endorses, nor contributes to political candidates, campaigns, or movements of any kind".[78]

	The Freedom Center was among a growing group of allied charities that received funding from large, conservative foundations such as Donors Capital Fund, Donors Trust, the Bradley Foundation and the Scaife family.

http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2013/december/climate-change/
	Conservative foundations have bank-rolled denial. The largest and most consistent funders of organizations orchestrating climate change denial are a number of well-known conservative foundations, such as the Searle Freedom Trust, the John William Pope Foundation, the Howard Charitable Foundation and the Sarah Scaife Foundation. These foundations promote ultra-free-market ideas in many realms.


https://www.templeton.org/grant/genetic-literacy-projectgene-ius-big-idea
	But there is room for expanding the GLP that could significantly increase its coverage, the range of projects it offers, and ultimately its influence. The GLP currently receives funding from Templeton, Searle Freedom Trust and Academics Review (a non-partisan NGO/non-profit representing scientists and academics and focused on genetics). Continued funding from the John Templeton Foundation would help us maintain and expand the GLP's efforts and increase our educational, public outreach efforts and policy influence.




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Literacy_Project
	The stated purpose of the Genetic Literacy Project (GLP) is to promote public awareness and discussion of genetics, biotechnology, evolution and science literacy.[2] It was founded by science journalist Jon Entine, who is its executive director.

set up some kind of fight between USRTK and GLP?


see that in their posts too, claiming Russian influence operations supporting "anti-GMO"


I guess this would be another instance of them controlling both sides


I wonder if this is a way to discredit Monsanto, food science? they wouldn't want disease-resistant crops, for example

kindof similar to Lysenkoism, even banned GMO food in Russia


------

so, a few ways GLP intersections with Russian propaganda:

- intersection in funding for them and funding for anti-climate science research

- used as a foil for anti-GMO propaganda

- similar, helping to discredit Monsanto, food science more broadly?

- "transhumanism" stuff, seen promoted in Russian propaganda, Jerome Glenn

- scientific "race realism" slant, also seen in amren

- anti-religious propaganda


also a surprising amount of posts on Mars


other than that little things that give them away, like rehosting RT

GLP posts on Lysenkoism seem off:


https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/12/09/opponents-of-gmos-might-learn-from-the-disastrous-legacy-of-soviet-era-lysenkoism/
	As a result of Lysenko’s intimidation tactics and reign of terror, research in and the teaching of many scientific topics such as hormones, neurophysiology, cell theory, genetics and other biological disciples were banned or impeded in the Soviet Union. This had a profoundly negative impact in hindering the pursuit of scientific knowledge. It is estimated that Lysenko’s war on genetics led to the arrest, firing or execution of 3,000 biologists. Scientific research in genetics was effectively destroyed until after Stalin’s death in 1953.


Wasn't Lysenko's "reign of terror," it was Stalin and the KGB


	...Lysenkoism is now often used metaphorically to describe the ideological manipulation or distortion of the scientific process as a way to reach a predetermined conclusion, all to serve political ends. This is exactly the tactics being utilized by the anti-GMO movement.

telling


https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/08/10/anti-gmo-activists-attacks-on-scientists-echo-soviet-persecution-of-geneticists/
	To stand with 40 other scientists preparing for a public reputation execution, is not to directly compare to Vavilov. The point is to compare where ideology violently overrules science.  It is relevant again as we witness a new war of anti-scientific ideas, along with an orchestrated intimidation and harassment of public scientists, and even threats of violence.


reads like propaganda, actin as a foil to anti-GMO I guess

Biological agents harmful to livestock and plants were tested at a special site near Novosibirsk. Munitions for the delivery of all types of biological agents were assembled at the Sverdlovsk facility.(12)

seem to act like shills for Monsanto, whether they are or not

some of the ways they defend Monsanto and attack activists make them look guilty (can catch them in a lie?). So they can make Monsanty (other biotech companies?) look guilty by association.

for anti-GMO part of argument looks like: if they don't want labelling, that means they must be trying to hide something

	...Among these lobbying groups operating on the UC campus is the Genetic Literacy Project (GLP).[7] Over the years GLP has gained recognition as a credible and reliable source of information about GMOs. It is one of the most frequently quoted sources of information by pro-GMO advocates and journalists. However in our opinion, GLP is perhaps one of the most spurious, financially compromised and scientifically illiterate organizations, founded and funded for the sole purpose of disseminating false pro-GMO propaganda that distorts peer reviewed literature in order to prop up public support for GMOs and genetic engineering in general.[8]


http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/33296-how-monsanto-solicited-academics-to-bolster-their-pro-gmo-propaganda-using-taxpayer-dollars
	The Bloomberg piece focused on how the Genetic Literacy Project, a clearly pro-GMO nonprofit that says its mission is "to disentangle science from ideology," published articles by the scientists on its website, without disclosing that the articles had been solicited by Monsanto and its PR firm.

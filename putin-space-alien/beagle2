	 History books will need to be rewritten after scientists announced today that Beagle 2 has been finally been found on Mars, 12 years after it vanished without trace.

	The beleaguered spacecraft, which has become a byword for mission failure, was spotted by scientists operating the HiRise camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). It was discovered just 5km from its original touchdown site in the Isidis Planitia basin.

	And it appears that just one faulty motor was behind the unsuccessful landing. The images show that solar panels which should have folded out to reveal a radio antenna, failed to open. An unlucky bounce on its side may also have misshapen the probe preventing it from opening up properly. 


 	...Previously it was thought that the lander had been destroyed on impact after crashing to the ground when its parachute and airbags failed to deploy.

	But now it seems Beagle 2 made it safely to the surface but was crippled when it could not link up to Earth. 


interesting. A software or electronics problem?

	...“What seems to be the case is that it got to the ground. But a motor which opened the solar panels didn’t work.” 


or a mechanical problem with the solar panel motors


	...Hailed as Britain's first probe to another planet, Beagle 2 was supposed to have touched down on Mars on Christmas Day 2003 to perform experiments to detect signs of alien life.

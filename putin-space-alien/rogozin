 	Dmitri Rogozin, the deputy prime minister responsible for space industries, confirmed that the issue was being studied by a government commission investigating the failure of the $165 million (£107 million) probe, which crashed back to Earth on Sunday. “This theory has a right to exist,” he said. “I hope it’s not so. However, if it is so, the necessary conclusions will be made.”

	Russia plans to organize a permanent base on the moon rather than leave it after several successful missions, the Russian deputy defense minister in charge of defense and space industries said. "The moon is not an intermediate point in the [space] race, it is a separate, even a self-contained goal. It would hardly be rational to make some ten or twenty flights to the moon, and then wind it all up and fly to the Mars or some asteroids. 

	This process has the beginning, but has no end: we are going to come to the moon forever," Dmitry Rogozin said in an article to be published by the government daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta on Friday. A mission to the Moon has become one of Russia's top space priorities.

	He was admitted to Burdenko Military Hospital in Moscow on 7 March 2012 because of "physical and emotional exhaustion." [18][19] Kommersant claimed that he fainted on the stairs outside the agency [20] and Russian tabloid Life News claimed he was hospitalised with head injuries. Other media claims that he was hospitalised after being struck on the head with a bottle during a fight, and that the fight was over his press secretary and former model Anna Vedicheva.[21][22]

	When Popovkin returned to work on 19 March 2012 he gave an interview with Izvestia in which he vehemently denied some of the stories about the reasons for his hospitalisation, which he blamed on sections of the Russian space industry who are threatened by his attempts to counter corruption

	Former Roscosmos Chief Vladimir Popovkin Dies at 57

	Vladimir Aleksandrovich Popovkin, former head of the Federal Space Agency, or Roscosmos, passed away on Wednesday from an undisclosed illness at the age of 57, a Roscosmos press release said.


why did Popvkin die?

	As head of Roscosmos, Popovkin had to answer for the failure of the 2011 Fobos-Grunt robotic mission to one of the Martian moons — the probe malfunctioned before it could even leave low Earth orbit, and burned up unceremoniously in the Earth's atmosphere a few weeks later.

	Undeterred, Popovkin moved to give Russia's space science community a means of saving face, and seized the opportunity to participate in the European Space Agency's, or ESA's, own unmanned Mars mission — ExoMars. Originally an ESA-NASA project, Washington pulled out of the program amid budget cuts in 2012, leaving Europe in a precarious position until Roscosmos swooped in and filled the gap — saving the scientific ambitions of both ESA and Roscosmos. 


Popvkin a good guy?

he's also the guy who blamed sabotage, although it looks like he might have been right in a way...

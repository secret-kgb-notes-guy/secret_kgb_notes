	He was admitted to Burdenko Military Hospital in Moscow on 7 March 2012 because of "physical and emotional exhaustion." [18][19] Kommersant claimed that he fainted on the stairs outside the agency [20] and Russian tabloid Life News claimed he was hospitalised with head injuries. Other media claims that he was hospitalised after being struck on the head with a bottle during a fight, and that the fight was over his press secretary and former model Anna Vedicheva.[21][22]

	When Popovkin returned to work on 19 March 2012 he gave an interview with Izvestia in which he vehemently denied some of the stories about the reasons for his hospitalisation, which he blamed on sections of the Russian space industry who are threatened by his attempts to counter corruption

	Former Roscosmos Chief Vladimir Popovkin Dies at 57

	Vladimir Aleksandrovich Popovkin, former head of the Federal Space Agency, or Roscosmos, passed away on Wednesday from an undisclosed illness at the age of 57, a Roscosmos press release said.


why did Popvkin die?

	As head of Roscosmos, Popovkin had to answer for the failure of the 2011 Fobos-Grunt robotic mission to one of the Martian moons — the probe malfunctioned before it could even leave low Earth orbit, and burned up unceremoniously in the Earth's atmosphere a few weeks later.

	Undeterred, Popovkin moved to give Russia's space science community a means of saving face, and seized the opportunity to participate in the European Space Agency's, or ESA's, own unmanned Mars mission — ExoMars. Originally an ESA-NASA project, Washington pulled out of the program amid budget cuts in 2012, leaving Europe in a precarious position until Roscosmos swooped in and filled the gap — saving the scientific ambitions of both ESA and Roscosmos. 


Popvkin a good guy?

he's also the guy who blamed sabotage, although it looks like he might have been right in a way...

guys on nasa space flight forum liked him



	zvestiya quotes a Roskosmos official (Denis Lyskov) as saying that Popovkin’s disease (cancer) was most likely brought on by his exposure to toxic fumes after the Proton crash last July.

	http://izvestia.ru/news/572644

	“At the moment of the launch we were in a bunker several hundred kilometers from the launch pad. After the explosion of the rocket we remained in the bunker for a while until we received information that the air outside was safe to breathe. Vladimir Aleksandrovich [Popovkin] was the first to leave the bunker, he ordered his driver out of the car,  jumped in the car himself and drove to the crash site without taking any protective measures. He felt personally responsible for what had happened and simply didn’t think of protecting himself.
	…
	When Vladimir Aleksandrovich got ill, doctors concluded that the disease had been triggered by the hydrazine cloud. Asked later by his colleagues what he would have done if  he had known that his health would be jeopardized like that, he always answered that he would have done exactly the same …  It was very important to act quickly at that moment. In fact he sacrificed himself.”


a claim he died for hydrazine exposure from launch failure he felt "personally responsible" for


	Several Russian media have picked up the story about Popovkin's disease being related to last year's Proton crash, but they all of them refer to last Wednesday's Izvestiya article quoting Roskosmos official Denis Lyskov.  Lyskov can be seen relating the story here :

	http://lifenews.ru/news/135261

	He describes Popovkin as "a workaholic in the positive sense of the word", suggesting that the high workload and stress may have contributed to his condition.

	The article in Kommersant earlier referred to here by JimO says Popovkin's deteriorating health was the main reason for his replacement by Ostapenko last October (and not the numerous failures in the Russian space program and the resulting re-organisation of the Russian space industry) . In fact, this had already been suggested by some media reports at the time.

	The same day Popovkin died, a 53-year old Khrunichev quality control manager (Gennadiy Lashkov) apparently committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the mechanical shop where he worked.  Inevitably, at least one Russian media outlet has linked both events :

	http://www.kp.ru/daily/26245.4/3126245/

	However, it would appear the suicide took place several hours before news of Popovkin's death broke.   Other reports link the suicide to wage cuts at Khrunichev in the wake of recent Proton failures.

	The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) currently lists hydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine as suspected human carcinogens, but has recently recommended that the listing of hydrazine be changed to that of animal carcinogen, not likely to cause cancer to people under normal exposure conditions.


http://www.toxipedia.org/display/toxipedia/Hydrazine


seems like Hydrazine will kill you in other ways before killing you with cancer?

	Case Study of Hydrazine Poisoning

	In a 1965 correspondence from F. James Reid to the British Medical Journal, the effects of accidental hydrazine ingestion can be seen.

	A young English sailor had been drinking beer during the afternoon before being placed on duty in the evening. He was considered to be fit for duty and competent until the accident. While working in his ship's engine room, the young sailor ingestion between a mouthful and a cupful of concentrated Hydrazine believing it was water.

	Hydrazine, greatly diluted, was used on board the ship to prevent corrosion in the ship's boilers by seawater.

	Immediately upon drinking the chemical, the sailor vomited and returned to the deck to report to his superior officer at 11:30pm. After having been given a raw egg and milk, he vomited once more and collapsed, unconscious onto the floor.

	Upon admission in a West African Hospital at midnight he was flushed, afebrile, unconscious, continent, and vomiting. His pupils were dilated, central and reacted to light; however, there were no chemical burns on his lips or mouth and he was able to swallow. At this time the respiratory and central nervous systems were normal upon clinical examination.

	...The patient improved hour by hour, though the main concern was for his neurological state. His psyche, memory, voluntary motor skills, and higher functions were normal. However, he had ataxia even with his eyes open, a lateral nystagmus to the right, and a loss of vibration sense. He was unable to write, though he could draw. There was paresthesia of all four limbs at the extremities and he was unable to reproduce one hand movement imposed upon the other. Severe hypoesthesia of the hand (especially the right hand), in distribution of the radial nerve ensued. E.E.G. results were within normal limits and tendon reflexes were normal. Fortunately, the ataxia was improving to the point that the sailor would able to travel unescorted by air to England, only two weeks after leaving Africa.

	The final condition of the young man is not known.

	Putin fires Russia space chief after mishaps
	April 29, 2011 by Stuart Williams

	Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Friday fired the Russian space agency chief after a series of high-profile setbacks cast a shadow on the 50th anniversary year of Yuri Gagarin's first space flight.

	Anatoly Perminov will be replaced as head of Roskosmos by First Deputy Defence Minister Vladimir Popovkin, the government said in a statement, quoting an order signed by Putin.

	The order said Perminov had reached the maximum age for state employees but there have been clear indications for some time of growing frustration in the government with Roskosmos' performance.


so Popovkin initially Putin's replacement for Roscosmos "perfromance issues" as of April 29 2011

	...Reports have said that the last straw was when the latest manned launch for the International Space Station was delayed due to a technical problem just two weeks ahead of the Gagarin anniversary.

	Russia on April 12 marked 50 years since Gargarin's historic first space flight with huge fanfare and President Dmitry Medvedev made clear in a Kremlin address that space exploration remained a priority for the country.

	"It's quite clear what the cause is," leading defence analyst Alexander Goltz told Moscow Echo radio station, commenting on Perminov's departure.

	"The most recent failures of Roskosmos like the failed Glonass launch and much else shows the clear worsening of technological discipline in its units."

	Perminov has served as Roskosmos chief since March 2004.


so like that, wanted his "people" in? but in to do what?

would think he wanted Popovkin to do something that Perminov wasn't doing

then apparently, whatever it was, Popovkin didn't want to do it

	..."The question is to what extent there has been a degradation in Roskosmos' technological units and whether an organiser like Popovkin can change the situation," he said.


makes it sound like the launch sabotages would be used as leverage against Roscosmos


a few months earlier:


https://phys.org/news/2011-02-russia-deputy-pm-blasts-childish.html
	Russian space agency Roskosmos has committed "childish" errors and failed to build enough spacecraft, the government said Monday in an unprecedented rebuke to the Russian equivalent of NASA.

	..."The recent failure with the Glonass satellites is a characteristic example," Ivanov said. "I won't go into details, this was a mistake, but a childish one and a mistake that had serious consequences."

	"Any repeat of the mistakes of the recent past -- and I am referring to the loss of the Glonass satellites and the partial Geo-IK failure -- is of course unacceptable," he warned, quoted by Russian news agencies.

	...He said that six spacecraft for civilian purposes had failed to launch in 2010 due to the delays.

	"And I am not even talking about the systematic delays to launch dates which were a consequence of the spacecraft not being ready," he added.

	Ivanov also criticised Roskosmos for failing to properly insure the Glonass satellites, after the agency conceded last year its policy did not cover the full cost.

	"Where is the insurance?" he was quoted as saying. "Everything needs to be insured according to real market prices using real insurance mechanisms," he added.

	Russia on Saturday successfully launched a Glonass satellite from its northern Plesetsk launchpad, restoring some pride after the catastrophic December launch.

	The Russian space programme suffered from a sharp drop in funding after the fall of the Soviet Union, and Roskosmos has sent several paying space tourists to the International Space Station (ISS) to help make ends meet.

	Yet the onus on Russia is set to grow when NASA takes the US shuttle out of service this year, leaving the Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft as the sole delivery systems for taking humans to the ISS.



so cut funding while blaming them for falling behind, even though they are #1, relied on for human space flight in general


Ivanov the one harping on them. Was KGB, "friend" of Putin:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Ivanov
	Before joining the federal administration in Moscow, Ivanov, a fluent speaker of English, served from the late 1970s in Europe and in Africa as a specialist in law and foreign languages. As an employee of the KGB in Soviet Union era, Ivanov became a friend of his colleague Vladimir Putin, who appointed him as his Deputy in the late 1990s.

	...On 12 August 2016, Ivanov was fired from his Chief of Staff position by Putin and replaced by Anton Vaino. Ivanov then became a special envoy for transportation and the environment. Putin's firing of Ivanov was part of a series of replacements of Putin's older peers with young loyalists.[26]. The Steele Dossier (Report 2016/111) claims that his encouragement of meddling in the US 2016 Presidential elections, which provoked unanticipated blowback against the Kremlin, was the catalyst for his firing.


weird

https://russiandefpolicy.blog/tag/vladimir-popovkin./
	Marker.ru’s Ivan Cheberko writes that Perminov will resign at “his own request,” and become a presidential adviser for space issues.  For his part, Popovkin had hoped to replace Sergey Ivanov as Deputy Prime Minister with responsibility for the defense-industrial sector.  But Medvedev and Putin couldn’t agree on Ivanov’s fate, according to Cheberko’s report, and they proposed that Popovkin should head Roskosmos.


makes it sound like Popovkin a big player

also says competing with Ivanov, though not sure if that means anything

	March 11, 2012,

	MOSCOW, March 11 (Itar-Tass) — Head of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) Vladimir Popovkin has been taken to the Burdenko Hospital in connection with his health deterioration, the agency’s press service told Itar-Tass.

	“Head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin on March 7, due to his health deterioration, was taken to the Burdenko Hospital where he got first aid,” the press service said. “At present, the health condition of Vladimir Popovkin causes no concern and is described as stably good. The recovery process will take several says, after which he will return to his line of duty.”

	“In the opinion of specialists, the deterioration of Roskosmos head’s health was caused by continued physical and emotional strain, including frequent official business trips with jet fatigue and intensive work,” the press service reported.

	At present, Roskosmos head’s State Secretary Vitaly Davydov is temporary acting head of the agency.



comes of as a sort of warning?

https://www.space.com/23195-russia-space-agency-chief-fired.html
	“I hope that a whole number of problems, which unfortunately have lately been observed in Roscosmos activities, will be overcome with your arrival,” Medvedev said in a meeting with Ostapenko, a transcript of which was posted on the Russian Cabinet’s website. “I hope that all launches, including future ones, will be carried out in accordance with plans.”

	...His latest assignment follows a series of embarrassments for the Russian space program, the latest being the crash of a Proton rocket carrying three Glonass navigation satellites just seconds after liftoff in July. That failure has since been attributed to improperly installed motion sensors on the vehicle.


ok, so this particular failure, high profile, alleged to be sabotage (by Popovkin) and "investigated" by FSB was used as pretext to fire Popovkin


Popovkin "sick" after 1 year on job, out a year later, dead a year after that


dead of "cancer" 18 June 2014


perhaps he knew something? like of sabotage?

	The Proton-M launch vehicle will put into orbit the latest Olimp satellite for electronic reconnaissance and communications, created in the Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems (Zheleznogorsk), commissioned by the FSB. As writes "Kommersant" referring to a high-ranking source in Roskosmos, the device is included in the schedule of launches. All the tactical and technical characteristics of the satellite are classified. His start was planned last year, but because of the need for additional tests, the timing shifted.

	On how this launch will take place, the fate of the deputy head of Roskosmos Anatoly Shilov, who oversees the creation of automatic space vehicles, will depend on the publication. To work on some of them, special admission of special services is required. Shilov is the only deputy head of Roskosmos who has access to information on the project, and his dismissal can only happen with the sanction of the FSB.

	The previous head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin was dissatisfied with Shilov's work and appealed to the security bodies with a request to give such a sanction for dismissal. The permit was received, but with the proviso that the resignation can take place only after the launch of "Olympus", writes Kommersant. During this time Popovkin himself was headed by Roskosmos, ex-deputy defense minister for military science Oleg Ostapenko, who had no complaints about Shilov's work. Ostapenko revised Popovkin's decision and again entrusted Shilov with supervising the Glonass project in the department. In May 2011, Shilov received a reprimand from Vladimir Putin in connection with the errors in the creation of spacecraft "Meridian", "Condor" and "Geo-IK2."

	In case of failure with the "Olympus", the FSB will demand that the guilty be identified, and "Shilov will be asked first of all," the interviewee said in the agency. In September 2014 Shilov turns 60 years old. 


FSB guy in Roscosmos, Popovkin wanted him gone, but the request was refused

	At the same time, he added that by 2013 it is planned to create a space-based system that will allow monitoring of the devices during their entire flight in real time. This is the so-called multifunctional space retransmission system "Ray". The system will be based on satellites of the same name series, developed in the NG Reshetnev. 


interesting, would have prevented the failures?

	Also, Popovkin acknowledged that by launching "Phobos-Grunt", Roskosmos was very risky. He noted that the device was designed in conditions of limited funding. Hence, there were risky technical solutions. At the same time, the Federal Space Agency was bound by obligations with China and Europe, which took part in the mission. As a result, according to Popovkin, Roskosmos faced a choice: to launch the device or simply to throw it away. He also added that the reasons for the failure of the mission are still unclear. 


designed with limited funding, limited window, then blames sabotage, but not a specific country


interesting, seems like a move to protect himself and Roscosmos in a way too? I think he started the idea that could be sabotage, maybe prompt the investigation. Did he want people to eventually pin on FSB?

	For several days, unsuccessful attempts were made to establish communication with the apparatus. Finally, in the 20th of November, the radio station of the European Space Agency in the Australian city of Perth was able to communicate with the apparatus. After some time, it was possible to establish communication with Baikonur - engineers were able to obtain some data from the apparatus. To correct the situation, however, failed. 


lost, but certainly not without effort by Roscosmos to recover

 	"Phobos-Grunt" was launched to Mars on November 9, 2011. On the third hour of the flight, when the device was in a reference near-earth orbit, there were malfunctions - the propulsion engine did not turn on and the probe could not reach the departing trajectory to the Red Planet.

	Vitaly Lapota , head of the Russian space-rocket corporation Energia, said that humanity should now be concerned with the issue of the colonization of Mars.

	"Astrophysicists believe that our star will begin to expand in the next millions of years. The expansion will stop between Earth and Venus. And humanity will extend its life, only moving to Mars, "- he said at the International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg. According to the head of "Energy", "this is one of the most realistic forecasts for hundreds of millions of years." "But we must start today," he summed up.

	These words can be treated differently - from the usual arguments that "there is nothing for people, but they go to Mars ...", to the realization that without further development of space around the Earth life on the planet will worsen. But, in this case, it's interesting. Russia now does not have a launch vehicle to fly not only to Mars, but also to the moon. But if it appears, it will cause a revolution in the whole world of space exploration. 


	...In order to fly not only to Mars, but at least to the Moon, for technologies of the modern level, a carrier rocket (RN) with a payload of at least 80 tons is needed. Russia does not have such a launch vehicle.


Is this what the SLS is supposed to be also?

	...This happened not without the participation of another coryphaeus of Russian cosmonautics, Valentin Petrovich Glushko, who at the beginning of the 1970s headed the NGO Energia, created from his design bureau (it was engaged in the development of rocket engines under the designation "RD") and KB Korolyov. However, Glushko managed to create his own heavy LV "Energia", which in autumn 1988 put into orbit a reusable space ship "Buran" weighing more than 100 tons.

	Unfortunately, that flight of Buran was the first and last. And the Russian cosmonautics again "stung" to the "Protons" with a payload of up to 25 tons and 7-9 ton "Soyuz". However, in 2009 Roskosmos announced a tender for the development of a new heavy Russian launch vehicle. And it was expected to be won by the "triumvirate" in the person of the leading space and space centers "TsSKB-Progress" (developer and manufacturer of Soyuz), RSC Energia and the State Space Center named after VP Makeev. They committed to 2015 to lift into the air a new heavy rocket "Rus-M" with a carrying capacity of 50 tons, and in the future to increase the weight of the payload of this launch vehicle to 100 tons, which is enough to start interplanetary travel. 


Roscosmos wanted rocket for interplanetary travel

	...However, when Roskosmos was headed by Vladimir Popovkin , all the work on Rus-M was canceled, and the project of the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center) for the development and production of modular LV Angara , which provided for the creation of a whole "line" of unified missiles carrying capacity from 2 tons (Angara 1.1) to 25.8 tons (Angara A5). 


but canceled under Popovkin


	...Therefore, with the appointment last fall of the new head of Roskosmos Oleg Ostapenko in the industry, they started talking about the fact that the Russian Federal Space Agency again includes in the Federal Space Program for 2016-2025 the design of a super-heavy LV with a carrying capacity of 70-80 tons with the possibility of upgrading to 120 tons and more useful load. That is, this is the way according to which, according to Oleg Ostapenko, the United States and China, first of all, are going.


hmmm

not sure what this means, but at least someone talking about mars mission from Russia

	Russia is not going to prolong the operation of the International Space Station (ISS), which the American colleagues insistently suggest. In this regard, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin replied that the ISS of Russia is needed until 2020. After this period, financial resources will be redirected to other, more promising space projects. Thanks to the published draft of the Concept of the Russian lunar program, today we have an opportunity to understand the future priorities of Russian space exploration. 


Rogozin says no more ISS support by 2020


so what, take over space flight, kill their own space program, then kill ISS?


	If we talk about the time frames of the program, they now look much more realistic than before. For example, the former head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin voiced the agency's plans to equip a manned expedition to a natural satellite of the Earth already in 2020. Incidentally, it should be noted that at this stage of development only Russia from the entire international club of space powers has not sent to any other planets any own spacecraft. This should also be taken into account when speaking about the timing of the Russian space program. 


yet phobos-grunt was sabotaged...

	Then the cosmonauts and participants of the solemn meeting were addressed by the head of the Federal Space Agency V. Popovkin, who congratulated the crew on the successful flight and execution of the expedition program. "Your flight once again confirms the fact that the International Space Station is a successful project that has the right to exist," the head of the Russian space agency noted.

	VA Popovkin also thanked the staff of the MCCs in Korolev and Houston for the excellent work during the flight of the crew and expressed gratitude to the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center and the Space Center. Johnson for excellent training of astronauts. The head of Roskosmos presented Sergei Volkov, Satoshi Furukawa and Michael Fossum departmental awards of the agency and wished cosmonauts a speedy recovery after the flight.

	23 October 2012


	The leadership of the Russian Space Agency is looking for a candidate for the post of head of TsNIIMASh - the head scientific enterprise of the rocket and space industry. As Izvestia was told by an informed source in Roskosmos, the institute can be headed by Alexander Milkovsky, the head of the 4th Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (4 Central Research Institute of the RF Ministry of Defense).

	The head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin does not hide his discontent with the work of the current head of the Central Research Institute of Nuclear Physics, Gennady Raikunov.

	- I do not like very much in TSNIIMASH. I said that Gennady Gennadievich [Raikunov] (director of the institute .- "Izvestia") will pass the certification only after he has solved a number of problems. He has not been certified since March, "Popovkin said in September at a meeting with students of technical universities.

	- He can not organize a normal structure and can not say where the prospects are - today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow at the institute. If this does not appear before the end of the year, then there will be another head who can do this, Popovkin explained the essence of his claims to Raikunov.

	Alexander Milkovsky leads four CRIs since 2010. Shortly before his appointment, three research organizations of the Defense Ministry, working in the interests of the Strategic Missile Force and the Air Force, joined the institute. As a result, the 4th Central Research Institute became the largest research organization in the structure of the Ministry of Defense. During the USSR, the profile of the Quartet consisted in ensuring the development of the Strategic Missile Forces group based on mobile and stationary complexes of a new generation. Later, in 4 CRI, programs were developed to reduce offensive weapons, optimize the composition of troops in the face of reduced funding. 


dunno if this means anything

	Roskosmos replaced the head of the Central Research Institute

	The leading scientific organization of Roskosmos will be headed by Alexander Milkovsky, the head of the 4th Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense

	February 19, 2014, 01:01 

	...News about the replacement of heads of enterprises of the space industry in recent months appear regularly: the head of Roskosmos, appointed in October last year, Oleg Ostapenko resolutely changes the team of directors. Recently, the head of the Center for the Operation of Ground-Based Space Infrastructure (FSUE TsENKI), Alexander Fadeev, the director of the Yuzhny Space Center Yevgeny Anisimov, has resigned, the replacement of the head of the RKK Raikunov is being prepared.

	"TsNIIMash is one of the key organizations in the Roskosmos system," says the scientific director of the Space Policy Institute Ivan Moiseyev. - So it is not surprising that the head of the agency was concerned about the change of the head of this organization. Ostapenko puts his people on significant positions, which, incidentally, was not actively pursued by his predecessor, Vladimir Popovkin.

 	"Mars-500": better than nothing? 

 	On Friday, an experiment in isolation was completed in Moscow, conducted by the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP). In the course of this study, six volunteers from four countries - crew commander Alexei Sitev, Sukhrob Kamolov and Alexander Smoleevsky (Russia), Charles Roman (France), Diego Urbina (Italy) and Wang Yue (China) were held in a special room, in professional jargon called "Barrel", 520 days. That is how much the first "firing" mission to Mars should last. The area of ​​the "barrel" is 180 square meters. 

 	...The fact that Mars-500 has a real meaning for the preparation of the Martian expedition is evidenced by the fact that among the scientific partners of IBMP there is no NASA for this experiment, and there are not a single representative of the USA among its participants, although this is the only country to date, which, as already noted, a specific time for sending their astronauts to Mars. Moreover, in 2010, the Chilean government appealed to NASA, and not to Roscosmos, to help save the Chilean miners trapped in the underground trap in the summer and fall of the same year. The request was motivated by the fact that NASA has experience in conducting "experiments in extreme isolation", although in the USSR / Russia since the early 1960s many more such experiments have been carried out, more precisely, more than twenty. Among them were the annual, held in 1967-68, and the 240-day SFINCSS-99, held in 1999-2000, and among the participants - both women and representatives of other countries. 

	...This is not because American science is more "scientific" than Russian, but because America is compelled to do so in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals of exploring and developing "deep space" that were put before NASA by President Obama. A long flight to the asteroid or Mars does not leave the right to make a mistake, including in the field of psycho-emotional preparation of its participants.

	And what about Russia? Talk about the flight to Mars while so and remain conversations. Moreover, the head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin made it clear that the main efforts of the Russian space industry, including its manned sector, may be focused on the Moon in the near future. But on the Moon, where short-term missions are planned, and which is located in several days of flight from Earth, the results of the Mars-500 experiment are unlikely to be in demand to the extent that they justify carrying out this research.


Popovkin for the "moon instead of mars" thing too?

this was before phobos-grunt failure on November 9.

were doing research on mars flight though, not sure if Roscosmos was involved

article has hints of state propaganda

	ISS may not be flooded, but left in orbit until 2028

    	9 January 2012 

	...Earlier, the head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin said that the partner countries on the ISS agreed to create a group that will consider possible options for the development of manned space travel until 2030.

	Rocket and space technology will be created depending on the tasks assigned, Popovkin stressed.

	By Vladimir Isachenkov

	...Roscosmos chief Vladimir Popovkin stopped short of accusing any specific country of disabling Russian satellites, but in an interview in the daily Izvestia he noted that some Russian craft had suffered "unexplained" malfunctions while flying over another side of the globe beyond the reach of his nation's tracking facilities.

	Popovkin spoke when asked about the failure of the $170 million unmanned Phobos-Grunt probe, which was to explore one of Mars' two moons, Phobos, but became stranded while orbiting Earth after its Nov. 9 launch. Engineers in Russia and the European Space Agency have failed to propel the spacecraft toward Mars, and it is expected to fall back to Earth around Jan. 15.

	Roscosmos spokesman Alexei Kuznetsov refused to elaborate on Popovkin's comments, which marked the first time a senior Russian government official has claimed that foreign sabotage has been used to disable one of the country's satellites.

	Foreign influences?
	Popovkin said modern technology makes spacecraft vulnerable to foreign influences.

	"I wouldn't like to accuse anyone, but today there exists powerful means to influence spacecraft, and their use can't be excluded," he said.

	James Oberg, a NASA veteran and NBC News space analyst who has written books on the Russian space program, said Popovkin's comments were a sad example of the Russian cultural instinct to "blame foreigners." 


did he explicity blame foreigners? don't remember him saying that, should check...

Oberg paints it that way in a weird way


this was Jan 2012, two months before Popovkin had an unexplained "illness"


	...A retired Russian general alleged last November that the Phobos-Grunt might have been incapacitated by a powerful U.S. radar. Nikolai Rodionov, who previously was in charge of Russia's early warning system, was quoted as saying that a powerful electromagnetic impulse generated by U.S. radar in Alaska might have affected the probe's control system.

	Popovkin said experts have so far failed to determine why the Phobos-Grunt probe's engines failed to fire, but he admitted that the program had suffered from funding shortages that led to some "risky technological solutions."

	The spacecraft "Phobos-ground" could not leave the near-earth orbit and go towards Mars, said the head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin. If the situation can not be changed in the next three days, the first interplanetary mission of Russia in the past almost 15 years will be disrupted. In case of success, the station in three years should deliver to the Earth about 200 grams of soil from Phobos, a satellite of Mars. 

		On Wednesday, at 00.16 Moscow time, the Zenit-2SB launch vehicle was launched from the 45th site of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. She brought to the low earth orbit an automatic interplanetary station "Phobos-ground". About 6.00 MSK the device was supposed to be about 100 thousand kilometers from the Earth: after three inclusions of the marching propulsion system the station was to enter the flight trajectory to Mars. 

	But this has not happened yet.

	Initially, communication with the satellite was lost, and then, when it was restored, it turned out that the propulsion system did not work.

		Now the device, instead of heading for Mars, is still in a near-earth orbit.

		"Perhaps the device has not been oriented, and therefore the engines did not turn on," said the head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin. - Let's see the telemetry, and there will be a more understandable picture. I think that during the day we will already understand what happened. Now the group works here, in Baikonur, and in Moscow. We are now flying to Moscow, where we will be closer to the sources of information, because the stations of the Bear Lakes operate. 

	The device was supposed to reorient the Sun and the stars ... apparently, something happened at this stage.

 		We have a number of versions. Specialists work. Our funds RKO (Rocket Space Defense - the space control system, in particular - "Gazeta.Ru" ) first discovered it, gave out the coordinates, NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command - Command of the Air and Space Defense of North America .- "Newspaper .Ru " ) confirmed. The device is in the reference orbit. He is insured. We insured it for 1.2 billion rubles - this is the real cost of the device itself. The entire ROC costs about 5 billion, the apparatus itself - 1.2 billion. The insured event ends after the device has got on the departure trajectory. 


Popovkin wanted to save it


also had it insured (remember some Putin crony complaining about Roscosmos and insurance before)

	While he is in a supporting orbit, this is an insurance case. But I do not want to talk about this yet.

		For over 15 years we have not done anything, and we could not do it. We understand this, and, frankly, we understood the risk to which we are going, but it either had to go, or recognize that we are generally behind. If the station is lost, this, of course, will be a big blow to prestige in the first place. But thanks to the fact that we did this apparatus, we, most importantly, managed to pull up the youth. If we did not do it, then everything that the Soviet Union was doing would be lost. Now 40 percent of Lavochkin's NGO consists of people under 35 who have been involved in this program. " 

 		If the problem with the Phobos-Primor device is due to a software failure, and not to the failure of the equipment, there is a chance that the propulsion system will still work and the unit will go to Mars. But for specialists to do this, they have only three days - until the battery power of the device is discharged. 


someone was suspsecting software failure (what did Popovkin think?)

well if they tried to save it, might have hoped it was a software failure that could have been fixed

repropgram from ground or something?

(and if it can be reprogramed to work from ground, could it be reprogramed to fail?)

	...The director of the Institute of Space Research, Lev Green, recalled that this Martian satellite has long been stirring scientists. In the middle of the last century, the famous Russian astronomer Iosif Shklovsky even put forward a theory that Phobos is actually a hollow steel sphere with walls 76 cm thick, that is not a natural, but an artificial satellite of Mars created by a certain civilization. To this conclusion he was prompted by the data that the density of Phobos is really very small, and the satellite itself slows down, gradually approaching Mars


a bit of a strange article...

	Now, said Lev Green, it is well known that Phobos is still a natural satellite of the planet. It is a block of 20 km in diameter with a low density, it seems, is a porous structure, it is located at a distance of 10 thousand km from Mars and under the influence of the gravitational force of the planet it approximates to it by about 4 cm per year. 


I guess not that strange


	"We are really going to a very complex project, probably on the most complex in the history of both Russian and Soviet, of course, space science, but, perhaps, the world," says Lev Zeleny. This was recognized by the head of Roskosmos Vladimir Popovkin. "The novelty of the spacecraft" Phobos-ground ", given that we have not done anything for 20 years, even over 90%," he said at a meeting with State Duma deputies. "And we understand that this is a risk, but we also understand that if we do not launch it this year, then in 2013 this device will be useless to launch, and if we start a new one, then we will leave in 2016 and beyond ... This is a very risky business, but as an engineer who has worked all his life in this field, I will say that this is justified risk, we understand what we are going at. " 


I wonder why he says that... did someone not want him to launch?

 	There were shots of an amateur recording of the appearance of fragments of the "Meridian" in the sky. The fall of space debris scared the inhabitants of the Novosibirsk region. 

	24.12.2011, 14:35

	...Meanwhile, experts have already found out the reasons for another failure when launching the satellite - the engine failure of the Soyuz-2 launch vehicle. The head of the federal space agency Vladimir Popovkin said that the loss of "Meridian" is evidence that the Russian space industry is in crisis. The situation itself requires, in his opinion, a radical modernization and strict organizational measures.

	Vladimir Popovkin : "I think we will have an opportunity to objectively assess what happened. Proceeding from this, take some measures. I think that they will be, including organizational ones, and tough enough, including me, maybe. "

	Recall: an accident with the "Union" has become the fifth industry in the industry for the year and the sixth since December last year. At the end of 2010, due to improper refueling of the accelerating block, the Proton-M rocket carrier was unable to bring into space 3 satellites of the GLONASS system. In February, after the launch of the rocket carrier Rokot from Plesetsk, a geodetic geo-geo satellite, Geo IK-2, entered the non-computational orbit. After that, Anatoly Perminov left the post of the head of Roskosmos.

	On August 18, the "Express AM-4" communication satellite turned out to be in non-calculated orbit. On August 24, due to the crash of the carrier rocket, the Progress M-12 M truck was lost. In the beginning of November, the automatic interplanetary station "Phobos Grunt" could not start from low Earth orbit to Mars. It is still above the Earth and, according to experts, in the near future should fall. Now, because of the loss of the "Meridian" for an indefinite time, the launch of six Global Star satellites may also be postponed. 


article sounds threatening toward Popovkin


this was a few weeks before Popovkin came out with the "sabotage" thing for Phobos-Grunt, Phobos-Grunt still in orbit

what happened between the Phobos-Grunt failure and Popovkin's sabotage warning?

what is this


strangely worded letter alleging Soviets sabotaged challenger shuttle


has some interesting "facts" in the letter regarding Soviet kidnappings, spying


appears to be a call for donations for some anti-liberal activist group by a "Lt. Gen. Daniel O. Graham"

	" 'Doc' Tripp, who was then working on America's first space telescope, recalls, 'Those batteries were shepherded around, I swear, just as though it was a Brink's truck full of gold.  I was aware that we were competing very strongly with the Russians, and one way to beat us, of course, was to sabotage our effort here.  I don't know how many saboteurs there were on the program.  I never met one, as far as I know, but apparently there were.  And one of the places I remember where we got really involved with protection and security was with the batteries.'"[81]

	On July 6, Tad Szu1c putilished, an arti�le in  the Los Angles Times, in  which he clailmed that the French govern­ment is  now investigating  the· possibility that the May 30 explosion of the European Spa�e Agency Ariane rocket was caused by sabotage. While thi$ bombshell has been denied by official spokesmen of both the United States and France, Szu1c claims that France' s De�nse Minister, Andre Giraud touched on this topic when he visited Washington three weeks ago. He tied in the Ariane  expl.sion to the series of catastro­phes involving American spacq launches this year."

	In a departure from its public position, the French government has concluded that the explosion of its Ariane rocket at the Kourou launch site in French Guinea on May 30 may have been due to sabotage. According to French intelligence officials, the investigation into the Ariane accident has been secretly reopened because, "Initially we had no reason to raise the question of sabotage, but now we have reason to ask that question."

	France has shared its concerns and suspicions about Ariane with the highest levels of U.S. intelligence--French Defense Minister Andre Giraud is believed to have touched on this topic when he visited Washington last Tuesday and Wednesday--because of the series of catastrophes involving American space launches this year. The French and American accidents are adding up to a bizarre pattern, surrounded by strange coincidences and unexplained events, deeply preoccupying Western intelligence. These include the apparent defection to the Soviet Union in 1983 of the U.S. Air Force's leading expert on rocket self-destruct procedures.

	With the loss of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, a Titan 34-D rocket on April 18, a Delta rocket on May 3 and the French Ariane, all of which carried American reconnaissance satellites, the United States no longer has the capability of putting satellites into orbit to monitor Soviet nuclear deployments and serve as early-warning systems against a ballistic-missile attack. The Challenger and the Delta rocket were launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida, the Titan from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Before the string of 1986 losses, a Titan blew up at Vandenberg last August and an Ariane rocket exploded at Kourou in September.

	...French intelligence officials say that while the report is technically correct (the 1985 Ariane accident had the same cause), "it is very easy to perform sabotage in this context by one very well-placed person."

	...Intelligence officers believe that Hughes was either captured by Soviet agents or voluntarily defected to the Soviet Union. At the time of his disappearance, the Air Force said that he had no classified materials with him. But these intelligence officers point out that Hughes' knowledge of all the top-secret rocket launch procedures was invaluable to the Soviets, perhaps more so than the secrets delivered by recently captured spies. "He is worth his weight in gold to the Russians in terms of future 'Star Wars,' if we have them," one said. They see a clear link between Hughes and possible sabotage of the American and French launches.

	Another bizarre occurrence, neither explainable nor evidence of anything, was the sudden disappearance of Soviet trawlers from the Cape Canaveral area four hours before the scheduled launch of the Challenger on Jan. 28. The trawlers, which are electronic spy vessels, had been on station off the cape from the start of the U.S. space program. On that January morning, however, three or four trawlers steamed at flank speed in a northeastern direction away from the coast. Normally, these trawlers seek to monitor telemetric signals from the rockets before, during and after launch because they provide crucial data on the space vehicles' performance--among the most avidly sought information by both the United States and the Soviet Union on each other's ballistic arsenals. It is an absolute mystery why the trawlers, as observed by the U.S. Navy, went off station in this manner.

	The spectacular Christmas-day explosion of India's new Geo-Synchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV) — a gleaming 167-ft. (51m) tower of rocket — spared the country the deaths that sometimes accompany space disasters, but the public humiliation was another matter. Crowds swarmed the Satish Sahwan Space Center in Andhra Pradesh in anticipation of the launch and millions more watched live on TV as the GSLV's engines were lit at 4:04 PM. Forty-seven seconds later, engineers on the ground lost control of the vehicle. Sixteen seconds after that, they blew the haywire rocket up. A booster that was supposed to carry a critical telecommunications satellite into high-Earth orbit instead met its end just eight miles (13 km) over the Bay of Bengal.

	Why Life on Mars May Be Impossible
	Jeffrey Kluger

	...If there was any upside to the findings, it was in the type of cells Wadsworth and Cockell used in their study. Bacillus subtilis are among the commonest Earthly bacteria that can contaminate spacecraft before they leave the ground. The fear has always been that if they survived the interplanetary trip, the cells could contaminate Mars too, perhaps outcompeting native organisms. The fact that Mars is so unfriendly to at least this one type of life is very good news. The fact that it could be similarly hostile to all life is decidedly less so.

	China’s moon programme takes a hit due to Long March rocket failure

	Causes are still being investigated, but the second Long March mishap in two weeks was probably due more to bad luck than incompetence

	The unsuccessful rocket launch on Sunday could affect future Chinese space programmes, according to experts.

	Important projects including lunar exploration and space construction could be delayed, they said.

	It was China’s second launch mishap in less than two weeks. On June 19, a CZ-3 rocket launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in Sichuan province failed to deliver a television broadcasting satellite into orbit.

	China’s Long March rockets have been known for their reliability. Failures were rare, and two so close together is almost unprecedented.

	Prof David Southwood, a space scientist at Imperial College London, noted that Mars missions seem particularly prone to mishap. “If one were superstitious, one would say it is a return of the Mars gremlin.” However, he added that the failed landing attempt should not detract from the more important element of the mission, which was always intended to be orbiter’s measurements of trace gases, such as methane, which might indicate the presence of alien life.

	“Time and again the US Mars program faced failure and, like Robert the Bruce, straightforwardly went on with the task of overcoming setback,” he said. “Space exploration is tough. As long as we believe in its societal worth, Europe needs to do the same.”

	Many spacecraft built by the US or the Soviet Union failed to even reach orbit around Mars. In 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter became the Mars Collider and a case study for students of planetary exploration. The spacecraft was meant to be the first to observe the weather on another planet, but instead slammed into the atmosphere and tore apart. An investigation panel found the glitch in the spacecraft’s software. The force delivered by onboard thrusters was coded in imperial pounds instead of metric Newtons.

	According to Express, well known alien conspiracy theorist Scott C Waring offered his two cents about the news. He believes NASA is behind Schiaparelli’s crash and also had a hand in popping several foreign probes in the past.

	He accused the Americans of destroying the Russian Phobos probe in 1989 and the Phobos-Grunt lander in 2011. Waring says this was done to prevent other space agencies from finding evidence of life on Mars. While the theory seems very far-fetched, the Wikileaks email dump contained conversations between Clinton campaign chief John Podesta acknowledges the existence of aliens.

	“I was going to write a post about five days ago when I heard about the ESA Mars lander getting close to Mars…but then I just shrugged it off” Waring wrote on his blog UFO Sightings Daily. He says that the Americans have done it again except that this time they sabotaged their European neighbors.

	However this new one has to be one of the most sensational theories yet. The ‘UFO expert’ Scott C Waring claims the president was murdered after he sent a letter to the head of the CIA, just ten day before he was killed, demanding they reveal everything they know about UFOs.


same JFK conspiracy theories but with a UFO twist

wtf is this


why even do this

http://www.ufosightingsdaily.com/2016/03/triangle-ufo-seen-over-vladimir-putins.html
	This looks like a TR3B, or similar technology near Putins home. If it is a TR3B, it means Putin has some serious tech! Imagine flying from the earth to the moon in under a minute. That is a lot of power there. If its aliens visiting Putin, then he may have just acquired some very powerful friends. Either way, Putin is winning.

	 The leak of the SLS numbers brought out the program's critics as well.

	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who has advocated redirecting funds from SLS to NASA's effort to nurture commercially developed systems for ferrying crews to and from the international space station, said the cost estimates are grounds for terminating the heavy-lifter program.

 	"If true, these estimates are ridiculous," Rohrabacher said in response to a Space News query. "There is no way that the American people want us to spend more than $60 billion for a space exploration program that includes only one manned spaceflight before the end of the decade. Congress just canceled Constellation last year for these very same reasons."

	NASA finds apparent sabotage

 	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) -- The U.S. space agency NASA on Thursday confirmed it had discovered the apparent sabotage of a noncritical component of the international space station due to be carried up by the space shuttle Endeavour. It launched an investigation after finding cut wires in a piece of computer equipment intended to transfer data from station sensors to the ground, the agency said.

	NASA Finds Evidence of Sabotaged Computer Bound for Space Station

	Two weeks before the US space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to lift-off, the US space agency NASA says a piece of equipment that was to fly on the mission was deliberately sabotaged.

	During a briefing on launch preparations for space shuttle Endeavour, NASA officials revealed that a space program worker deliberately damaged a piece of equipment that is scheduled to fly aboard the space craft.

	The tampered device was due to be delivered to the International Space Station by Endeavour. It measures strain on a space station beam and relays the information to controllers on the ground.

	NASA's chief of space operations, Bill Gersteinmaier, says the space agency was notified of the sabotage by the company servicing the mission.

	"We then inspected the flight unit and determined that some wires were cut on the inside of that unit. It's a subcontractor on the space station side," he said. "We'll fix the hardware. We'll get [it] ready to go fly. I can't really discuss that and won't discuss that much more at this point."

	Gerstenmaier says the sabotage is under investigation and officials declined to speculate on a motive.

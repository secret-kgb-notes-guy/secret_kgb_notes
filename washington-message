In his farewell address, President Washington warned us about the dangers of factionalism, foreign influence, and the "spirit of party:"

I think some of his fears have come true.

There is a lot of distrust among our political parties these days, but I know Washington meant us well. Can you help me get his message to Congress?

Here is some background on the situation:

--------

On Jan. 13, 2017, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Bur promised a sound investigation of "links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns," [1] saying:
    "Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Schumer have made it clear they expect any investigation into Russia’s involvement in our nation’s elections to be conducted in a bipartisan manner.  It is a charge the [Senate Intelligence Committee] takes seriously, as bipartisanship—in fact, non-partisanship—is at the very core of the Committee’s charter and is essential to preserving the intelligence equities involved.”"

On Jan. 25, 2017, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes likewise promised an investigation of "links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns," [2] saying:
    "This issue is not about party, but about country. The Committee will continue to follow the facts wherever they may lead."

On Feb. 14, 2017, the New York Times reported [3] that, in the course of the 2016 election, senior Russian intelligence officials had repeated contacts with "members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates."

Notably, Attorney General Jeff Sessions was a key member of Trump's campaign, and is said to have a role in Trump's "inner circle" [4]. Sessions' parallel role as head of the Justice Department would be a serious conflict of interest that could shape the FBI's probe [5] into links between Trump associates' and Russian officials [6][7][8][9][10]. Sessions has refused to recuse himself [11].

On Feb 23, 2017, the White House asked the FBI to publicly dispute the New York Times report [12]. The FBI refused the request, citing that contacts between Trump associates and Russians are the subject of an ongoing investigation [13].

The next day, the Washington Post reported [14] that the White House had enlisted three senior officials, including Sen. Richard Burr and Rep. Devin Nunes, to dispute the New York Times report and similar reports:
    "Acting at the behest of the White House, the officials made calls to news organizations last week in attempts to challenge stories about alleged contacts between members of President Trump’s campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had previously [15] rejected calls for a special committee to investigate Russian interference in the election, on the grounds that Sen. Burr and Sen. Nunes are "responsible people":
    "McConnell ... called the allegations of Russian hacking 'a serious issue' but one that 'doesn't require' a special committee to run the inquiry. He also suggested that only one panel, the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate, needs to focus on such an investigation.

    'We have a Senate Intelligence Committee and a House Intelligence Committee, run by knowledgeable, responsible people,' he said. 'There's no question that the Russians were messing around in our election. It is a matter of genuine concern and it needs to be investigated.'"

Following the Feb. 14th New York Times report, Sen. McConnell has said [16] he has "no idea" if the Trump campaign had contact with Russian officials. The White House has denied any contact [17].

The House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, and Justice Department investigations investigations are the only investigations into the contacts between Russian intelligence officials and Trump's associates that could lead to criminal proceedings. Two of them are headed by officials complicit in a White House cover up of the contacts. The other is under jurisdiction of an official who is all but certainly a subject of the investigations.

It's hard to imagine that this arrangement will produce a just outcome [18]. Such a high-profile investigation must be handled with the utmost care toward ensuring public trust in its conduct: trust is a necessity for an effective and stable government, especially in times like these [19][20][21][22][23][24].

It is hoped our Government resists falling "prey to factions" [25] in their endeavors to rectify the present predicament. Even the most brilliant of our founding fathers bickered [26]. But the product of their bickering, tempered by reasoned debate, laid the foundation for the greatest nation on earth. Like the Constitution, the example they set has served as a gift to our nation for generations, and may serve it for generations more [27][28][29][30][31].

Four leaders of key House and Senate oversight committees pointed to two June 10, 2016, letters Beth Wilkinson drafted in conjunction with DOJ officials saying the FBI could only review Clinton email archives dated between June 1, 2014, and Feb. 1, 2015, and maintained by the Colorado firm Platte River Networks.

“These limitations would necessarily have excluded, for example, any emails from Cheryl Mills to Paul Combetta in late 2014 or early 2015 directing the destruction or concealment of federal records,” the congressmen wrote."

"The POGO recusal report details the ugly history of conflicted AGs, culminating with President Richard Nixon ordering then Deputy Attorney General Richard Kleindienst to drop an antitrust investigation into ITT, a Nixon campaign contributor. In Senate testimony, Kleindienst denied he had been pressured by the president. After Nixon’s clandestine tape recordings proved otherwise, the AG ended up pleading guilty to the misdemeanor of refusing to testify before Congress."

10. "As a final reform, we should reconsider the entire Hamiltonian concept of the “unitary executive.” When George Washington became president, he left a large organization (the Mount Vernon plantation) to head a smaller one (the federal government). But today, the executive branch is a behemoth, with control over law enforcement, the military, economic policy, education, the environment, and most other aspects of national life. That behemoth is responsible to one person, and that one person, as we have seen, is only loosely accountable to the electorate.

In other areas, the Framers solved this problem neatly: they divided power in order to protect against its abuse. Congress was split into the House and the Senate to ensure that the legislative process would not be so efficient as to absorb powers properly belonging to the other branches. The problem now is not an overweening Congress but an aggrandized executive branch; still, the remedy is the same. We should divide the executive branch between two elected officials—a president, and an attorney general who would be voted in during midterm elections.

As we are learning from the ongoing scandal of the torture memos, one of the drawbacks of a single executive is that Justice Department lawyers may consider it their job to twist the law to suit the White House. But the president is not their client; the United States is. Justice Department lawyers appointed by an elected attorney general would have no motive to distort law and logic to empower the president, while the White House counsel’s office, which does represent the president, would have every incentive to monitor the Justice Department to ensure that it did not tilt too strongly against the executive branch. The watchmen would watch each other."

In case it wasn’t clear, blue-state legislatures are not only in full frontal rebellion against President Donald Trump, they’re trolling him."

I am unable to conceive that the State legislatures, which must feel so many motives to watch, and which possess so many means of counteracting, the federal legislature, would fail either to detect or to defeat a conspiracy of the latter against the liberties of their common constituents. I am equally unable to conceive that there are at this time, or can be in any short time, in the United States, any sixty-five or a hundred men capable of recommending themselves to the choice of the people at large, who would either desire or dare, within the short space of two years, to betray the solemn trust committed to them. What change of circumstances, time, and a fuller population of our country may produce, requires a prophetic spirit to declare, which makes no part of my pretensions. But judging from the circumstances now before us, and from the probable state of them within a moderate period of time, I must pronounce that the liberties of America cannot be unsafe in the number of hands proposed by the federal Constitution.

From what quarter can the danger proceed? Are we afraid of foreign gold? If foreign gold could so easily corrupt our federal rulers and enable them to ensnare and betray their constituents, how has it happened that we are at this time a free and independent nation?"

Old friends don’t tiptoe around each other or pretend to agree unconditionally: they mix it up. They debate. Old friends speak their minds and hash it out. The early Americans kept the ancient conversation alive — they used it to found a nation. The beauty of the Classical canon is that it makes us part of that conversation, puts modern readers face-to-face with discussion partners across thousands of intervening miles and years. It’s not our job to revere them. It’s our privilege to argue with them."

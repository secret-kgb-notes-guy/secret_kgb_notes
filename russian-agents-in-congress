...Three  different  types  of  unwitting  agents  stand  out  in  the  2016 
campaign.  The  first  is  Wikileaks
.   During  the  2016  influence  operation 
Russian intelligence agencies have
 abused anonymity tools for hacking
18
â€”
and  for  leaking. 
Wikileaks 
was 
purpose
-
created  to  anonymize 
leaks. 
The 
controversial platform 
is a dream
-
come
-
true for active measures operators
. 
Those  Russian  intelligence  officers  tasked  with  utilizing  Wikileaks  will 
likely  play  by
  their  old  playbook:  any  unwitting  agent  is  more  effective 
when  left  in  the  belief  that  they  are  genuinely  holding  the  moral  high
-
ground, not representing an authoritarian intelligence agency. 


Did I not send them the thing on Wikileak's twitter? pretty sure I did multiple times...

the USIC report iirc even called wikileaks a kind of KGB front?
